Long-snouted Bat Platalina genovensium French: Lonchophylle du Pérou / German: Langmaulfledermaus / Spanish: Platalino de Peru Other common names: Peruvian Long-tongued Bat Taxonomy. Platalina genovensium Thomas, 1928 , “neighbourhood of Lima ,” Peru . This species is monotypic. Distribution. W Peru (from Piura to Tacna departments), an arid valley in NE Andes, and in extreme NW Chile . Descriptive notes. Head-body 67-80 mm, tail 6-6-8 mm, ear 12-21 mm, hindfoot 12-18 mm, forearm 46-53 mm; weight 8-14 g (males) and 9-16 g (females). The Long-snouted Bat is a large nectar specialist, with highly derived feeding apparatus, acquired independently of other specialized nectar feeders (e.g. Choeroniscus ). Pelage is undifferentiated, and guard hairs are absent. Dorsalfur is pale and comparatively long; basal two-thirds of each hair is whitish, and terminal one-third is brown. It can be identified by greatly elongated muzzle, with numerous short vibrissae; long and sparsely furred uropatagium; and shorttail, about one-third the length of uropatagium. Central rib of noseleaf is absent, and internarial region of noseleaf is smooth. Rostrum is longer than braincase. Upper postcanine tooth rows are parallel rather than converging anteriorly. Upper and lower incisors are large, spatulated, and procumbent. Canines are slender and lack conspicuous cingulum. Premolars and molars are elongated, and upper molars lack paracone and mesostyle. Dentary is long, and lowerincisors are bicuspid. Dental formulais 12/2, C1/1,P2/3.M 3/3 ( x2 ) = 34. Habitat. Arid regions of Peruvian and Chilean coasts from near sea level to elevations of ¢. 2600 m . A Long-snouted Bat was found in an arid valley in the northeastern Andes ( Huanuco Department). According to a potential distribution map, habitats of Long-snouted Bats contain xerophytic vegetation including columnar cacti, low annual rainfall (averaging 30-180 mm), and relatively low temperatures (9-15°C). Known roosts include tunnels, unused mines, and caves, always near food resources. Food and Feeding. Limited field studies indicate that the Long-snouted Bat is a nectarivore and depends on flowers of columnar cacti ( Weberbauerocereus weberbaueri and W. rauhii, Cactaceae ) for nectar and pollen. Phenological data indicates year-round fruit and flower production of these cactus species. Other frequent dietary items include insects (c.60%) and seeds/fruit pulp (c.20%). The Long-snouted Bat could include another columnar cacti (e.g. Browningia candelaris) in its diet, but their local densities are usually very low. Breeding. Pregnant Long-snouted Bats were captured in September-October; however, during a drought with reduced food resources in south-western Peru , no pregnant females were recorded for a two-year period. Activity patterns. Long-snouted Bats are nocturnal. Echolocation calls have FM fast pulses of 1-3 milliseconds at extremely low intensity (-10 dB to 35 dB), in sequences of 12-9 pulses/second; bandwidth averages 28-6 kHz and is discontinuous, with average interpulses of 67-6 milliseconds and energy peaks at 89-2 kHz. Pulses present harmonic above 190 kHz. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Roosts of Long-snouted Bats consisted of only males or mixed-sex aggregations, with sex composition at each roost varying over time. Subadult males share roosts with any sex, but subadult females only occur in mixed aggregations. Sex ratio for adults is almost 1:1. Colony sizes reach up to 50-60 individuals (median of five). Within a roost, groups of 5-7 individuals were found at different microsites. Long-snouted Bats were permanent residents in a roost over a three-year period, but they will move under severe changes in resource abundance (drought or mines closure or activity). Status and Conservation. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. The Long-snouted Bat could be in significant decline and facing widespread habitat loss throughout much of its distribution, thus making it close to being Vulnerable. Due to limited locality records, evidence of small populations, and destruction of its habitats, it is listed as endangered by the Peruvian government. Bibliography.

Head-body 60-63-5 mm, hindfoot 8-9 mm, forearm 38-7-41-3 mm; weight c. 12 g in the cerrado of Minas Gerais ; head-body 55-57, tail 10-12 mm, forearm 36-2-39-9 mm; weight 10-11 g in the caatinga of Bahia . No other specific measurements are available. Dorsal fur of Bokermann’s Nectar Bat ranges from yellowish brown to grayish brown. Hairs are bicolored, with light brown bases and dark brown tips. Underparts are lighter than dorsum, ranging from yellowish gray to grayish brown. Head is same color as dorsum. Deep medial sulcus occurs on chin, bordered by small warts. Well-developed bristles occur on upper and lower lip. Ears are round and small. Noseleaf is brown, with free flap at base of horseshoe. Wing membranes and uropatagium are dark brown. Uropatagium is long, reaching distal part oftibia. Calcar is smaller than foot but conspicuous. Tail is ¢.33% the length of uropatagium, with tip perforating uropatagium dorsally. Braincase is anteroposteriorly elongated, forming smooth slope between it and rostrum. Parietal and interparietal are slightly inflated. Rostrum is shorter than braincase. Basisphenoid pits are shallow. Zygomatic arches are incomplete. Palate is relatively short, broad, and V-shaped posteriorly. Mandibular condyle is placed above tooth row. I' are spatulated and project forward. Anterior surface of C' is grooved. P* is buccolingually narrow in occlusal view. Lower incisors are relatively broad and slightly trilobed. Chromosomal complement has 2n = 28 and FN = 50, with twelve pairs of metacentric or submetacentric and small pair of acrocentric autosomes. X-chromosome is metacentric, and Y-chromosome is acrocentric. Habitat. Rocky, montane fields (“campos rupestres”) at elevations of 720-1129 m. Vegetation is sparse and contains herbs, shrubs, grasses, and small trees. Food and Feeding. Bokermann’s Nectar Bat is a nectarivore. In an altered campos rupestres in Minas Gerais , it consumed pollen and nectar of Bauhinia rufa (Fabaceae) , and stomach contents contained fragments of ants ( Formicidae ). At another site in Minas Gerais , it consumed pollen and nectar of Encholirium glaziovi: ( Bromeliaceae ), a stemless bromeliad with terminal inflorescence 1-5-1-8 m tall. Bokermann’s Nectar Bat approached inflorescences c.30-60 minutes after dusk, circling around them but not visiting flowers. After these initial approaches, individuals begin to visit flowers. These bouts occurred at intervals of 5-40 minutes. When visiting inflorescences of E. glaziovii, individuals hovered in front of individual flowers and lapped nectar. They approached other flowers after short flights in loops. Two to six individuals perched on two small trees (2-3 m) located near flowers of E. glaziovii and remained in these nocturnal roosts for 5-30 minutes before restarting feeding bouts. Breeding. A pregnant Bokermann’s Nectar Bat was captured in January in Bahia , and reproductively inactive females were found in September—October in Minas Gerais . Activity patterns. In Bahia , Bokermann’s Nectar Bats left day roosts between 17:40 h and 22:00 h. In Minas Gerais , individuals began visiting flowers of E. glaziovii c.30 minutes after sunset. Bokermann’s Nectar Bat apparently is a cave-roosting species. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In Caetité ( Bahia ), a colony containing at least nine Bokermann’s Nectar Bats was found inside a mine, sharing it with Seba’s Short-tailed Bat ( Carollia perspicillata ) and Pallas’s Long-tongued Bat ( Glossophaga soricina ). Status and Conservation. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. For 40 years, Bokermann’s Nectar Bat was known only from three localities in Minas Gerais . In 2018, it was recorded in the state of Bahia , extending its distribution 840 km to the north. Even with an estimated extent of occurrence of 17,534 km ?it is still poorly known and restricted to a specific montane habitat. Bibliography. Almeida, B. et al.

Ben Keith's Short-tailed Bat Carollia benkeithi French: Carollia de Ben Keith / German: Keith-Kurzschwanzblattnase / Spanish: Carolia de Ben Keith Other common names: Benkeith's Short-tailed Bat Taxonomy. Carollia benkeithi Solari & R. J. Baker, 2006 , “ 2 km S of Tingo Maria, Province of Leoncio Prado, Department of Huanuco , Peru , at approximately 9° 18’ S , 75º 59' W .” Carollia benkeithi was split from C. castanea , which was shown to be a species complex based on molecular and morphological analyses. Monotypic. Distribution. Lowland forests of W Brazil , E Peru , and N Bolivia , S of the Amazon River. Because of abundance of individuals in the C. castanea complex, hampering precise species identification in the field and in collections, a detailed assessment ofits distribution is still needed. Descriptive notes. Head-body 52-58 mm, tail 5-14 mm, ear 11-20 mm, hindfoot 8-14 mm, forearm 33-7-37-2 mm; weight 11-16 g. Ben Keith’s Short-tailed Batis small. Dorsal hairs lack sharply defined banding; they have broad buffy chestnut band at bases, followed by brown yellowish band, and then narrow chestnut to dull gray-brown tips. Ventral fur has short bicolored, brown-tipped hairs. Forearms are short and naked, with tuft of hairs at bases of thumbs. Uropatagium is wide, with shallow distal notch. Tail is short, almost one-third the length of uropatagium. Wings are attached to ankles. Muzzle is conspicuous but short; lower lip has central papillae surrounded by smaller warts in a V-shape. Noseleafis short, with elongated tip. Ears are moderately large and triangular, and tips are pointed. Rostrum is short, braincase is globular, and zygomatic arches are incomplete. Anterior upper tooth row (to P?) is almost parallel, but posterior one-half is more divergent. Upper and lower molars are not broad. Cusps of M| are reduced and inconspicuous in side view. Dental formula for all species of Carollinis 12/2, C 1/1, P 2/2 M 3/3 (22) = 32. Chromosomal complement has 2n = 22 and FN = 38, with a single pair of mediumsmall acrocentric autosomes. Habitat. Typically tropical evergreen forests, but also secondary forests and much less commonly clearings or plantations, at elevations mostly below 1000 m . Locally, Ben Keith’s Short-tailed Bat can be the most abundant species of bats in some habitats, but it can be variably abundant at a regional scale. Some specimens from eastern Peru were more commonly mist-netted in brushy vegetation containing Piper sp. ( Piperaceae ) along edges of a small airstrip in the middle ofa village. Food and Feeding. Similar to other species of Carollia , fruits are the primary food of Ben Keith's Short-tailed Bat. It depends on Piper spp. in dry seasons, butit eats other fruit species during wet seasons, with preferences for fruits produced by understory plants such as Solanum (Solanaceae) and Vismia (Hypericaceae) . Insects are occasionally eaten. A study in south-eastern Peru found insect remains in ¢.20% of fecal samples, and more than 65% of feces included only fruit (including seeds of 48 plant species), and only one (2%) included pollen. Species of Carollia reacted to potential food (artificial fruit and real ripe Piper ) only when it had the typical odor of ripe fruit; they used odor as a primary clue to find ripe fruit. Shape and position offruits play important roles in foraging behavior. Echolocation is used for orientation in space and obstacle avoidance; echolocation calls are important at close range for final location of a fruit so it can be taken in flight. Breeding. Female Ben Keith's Short-tailed Bats have been reproductively inactive in May-July and pregnant in February-March, September, and November, which is similar to what is known for other species of Carollia . No specific data exist for Ben Keith's Short-tailed Bat, but the closely related Chestnut Short-tailed Bat ( C. castanea ) in Peru and Bolivia seems to be predominantly polyestrous. Activity patterns. Ben Keith's Short-tailed Bat is active during the first hours after sunset. Field data suggest that it is more active in the first one-half of the night, with only occasional captures after midnight. Scarcity of roost records probably indicates the difficulty of properly identifying it inside a roost, or it might use roosts opportunistically. Known roosts include shallow caves, rock crevices, tree holes, and human structures such as tunnels and bridges. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Ben Keith’s Short-tailed Bat seems to have small home ranges. It will share hollow trees with congeners such as the Silky Short-tailed Bat (C. brevicaudum), Seba’s Short-tailed Bat ( C. perspicillata ), and the Proboscis Bat ( Rhynchonycteris naso ). Status and Conservation. Not assessed on The IUCN Red List. Ben Keith's Short-tailed Bat can be fairly abundant locally, and its wide distribution might suggestit is not currently threatened.

Chestnut Short-tailed Bat Carollia castanea French: Carollia dAllen / German: Kastanienbraune Kurzschwanzblattnase / Spanish: Carolia de Allen Taxonomy. Carollia castanea H. Allen, 1890 , “ Costa Rica .” Restricted by R. H. Pine in 1972 to Angostura, San José, Costa Rica . S. Solari and R.J. Baker in 2006 identified C. castanea as a species complex based on molecular and morphological analyses. This account deals with the species as treated by L. J. McLellan and K. F. Koopman in 2008 that included C. castanea (sensu stricto) plus an unnamed species. Monotypic. Distribution. Central America from W Honduras to NW South America, including Colombia , Venezuela , Guyana , Ecuador , and N Peru , N of the Amazon River. Because of abundance of individuals of the C. castanea complex, hampering precise species identification in the field and in collections, a detailed assessment of its distribution is still needed. Descriptive notes. Head-body 48-60 mm, tail 7-14 mm, ear 15-19 mm, hindfoot 9-14 mm, forearm 34-38 mm; weight 11-16 g. The Chestnut Short-tailed Bat is small. Dorsal color varies from dull, dark gray-brown or chestnut to pale tan, rarely grayish; tricolored banding of hairs is not well defined; bases are dull brown; and fur is ¢. 6 mm long. Ventral hairs are short and bicolored, with brown tips. Forearms are short and naked, with tuft of hair at bases of thumbs. Uropatagium is wide, with shallow distal notch. Tail is short, almost one-third the length of uropatagium. Wings are attached to ankles. Muzzle is conspicuous but short; lower lip has central papillae surrounded by smaller warts in a Vor U-shape. Noseleaf is short with elongated tip, and horseshoe is fused below nostrils and free on sides. Ears are moderately large and triangular, with pointed tips. Rostrum is short, braincase is globular, and zygomatic arches are incomplete. Anterior upper tooth row (to P?) is almost parallel, but posterior one-half is more divergent. Lower premolars are graded, with P, being smaller rather than subequal; there is a gap between them. Upper and lower molars are broad. Cusps of M, are reduced and not visible in lateral view. Chromosomal complement has 2n = 20 (females) and 21 (males) and FN = 38, with an autosometranslocated to the subtelocentric X-chromosome. Habitat. Common in secondary woodland, clearings, and plantations and less common in mature forests, clearings, and fruit groves, mostly below elevations of 1000 m . Food and Feeding. The Chestnut Short-tailed Bat is most specialized on fruits of Piper (Piperaceae) , mostly in dry seasons; it eats fruits form various trees like Markea panamensis ( Solanaceae ) and Dipteryx panamensis ( Fabaceae ) in wet seasons. Insects are occasionally eaten. The Chestnut Short-tailed Bat forages near moist areas and is caught most frequently in tropical evergreen forests. It uses understory vegetation, where it concentratesits feeding on fruits of shrubs and small trees, especially slender green, candle-like fruits of Piper plants. Itis one of the most important seed dispersers for Piper and many other plants with small fruits. Breeding. Central American populations of Chestnut Short-tailed Bats in Panama have at least two birth peaks in April-May and August-November, confirming a polyestrous breeding pattern. Nevertheless, these records were taken from widely separate localities, and a fixed breeding pattern might characterize populations in a given area. Activity patterns. The Chestnut Short-tailed Bat is most active 1-3 hours shortly after sunset. Peak activity seems to occur for 3-5 hours of the night. Field data also confirm that it 1s more active during the first one-half of the night, with occasional captures after midnight. Scarcity of records might indicate difficulty of properly identifying it in roosts, or an opportunistic use of roosts where available. Chestnut Short-tailed Bats roost in caves, tunnels, hollow trees, and mines and under overhanging roots. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Chestnut Short-tailed Bat has small home ranges. It was found sharing a shallow limestone cave with Seba’s Shorttailed Bats ( C. perspicillata ). Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Chest nut Short-tailed Bat has a wide distribution and presumably large and stable population. Bibliography. Allen (1890c), Bonaccorso et al.

Seba’s Short-tailed Bat is the largest species of Carollia , although some measurements overlap with those of the Silky Short-tailed Bat (C. brevicaudum) and Sowell’s Short-tailed Bat (C. sowellr) in specific parts of their distributions. Dorsal fur of Seba’s Short-tailed Bat varies from blackish to various browns, grays, and bright orange. Fur appears shorter (5-6 mm), coarser, and sparser than in similar species. Hair on nape of neck has three bands, dark basal band, lighter middle band, and darker terminal band (sometimesfaintly frosted), but bands do not contrast sharply. Forearm is sparsely haired and looks naked in most populations. Longer tibia and feet as compared to other Carollia species. Wing membranes are dark brown to blackish and attached to ankles. Uropatagium is wide, enclosing shorttail (about one-third the length of uropatagium), with a deep notch. Horseshoe of noseleaf is free on sides and fused below nostrils. Lower lip has central papilla surrounded by smaller warts in a U-shape. Ears are moderately large, broad, and triangular, with pointed tips. Rostrum is elongated, braincase is robust, and interorbital region is slightly inflated. Upper tooth rows are fairly straight and more crowded than in the Silky Short-tailed Bat, with reduction of diastema between premolars. Lower jaw is Vshaped, and occlusal surface of I, is concealed by canine cingula. Chromosomal complement has 2n = 20 (females) or 21 (males) and FN = 36. Females are XX and males XY. additional Y is the homolog of an autosome translocated to the X element. Habitat. Typically humid tropical forests commonly at elevations below 1700 m and less frequently up to 3000 m . Seba’s Short-tailed Bat also is tolerates different habitats. It is found in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests and cleared areas covered with only grass, thickets, low shrubs, and a few trees. It might have a preference for degraded areas, where humans have transformed original forests into agricultural clearings. It can be found in open formations like savannas, cerrado, Pantanal wetlands, dry forests, deciduous forests, urban areas, and human-disturbed forests, but at lower densities. Food and Feeding. Seba’s Short-tailed Bat is perhaps one of the most studied phyllostomids relative to its ecology, almost as much or greater than Jamaican Fruit-eating Bat ( Artibeus jamaicensis ) or Pallas’s Long-tongued Bat ( Glossophaga soricina ). Foraging patterns have been studied in detail in Costa Rica and Panama . More than 50% of dietary fruits are produced on low trees and shrubs, categorizing this bat in the “ground-story” frugivore guild. Fruit is usually carried off to be consumed in a temporary night roost. Individuals have spatially well-defined feeding patterns, with little overlap between individuals; Piper spp. ( Piperaceae ) is the preferred food during rainy seasons. Diet also includes other available fruits and some insects. Insect material constituted as much as 40% of stomach contents of Panamanian individuals in April-May. Insects constitute 10% of stomach contents in wet season and 40% in dry season in Costa Rica . It seems Seba’s Short-tailed Bat purposely supplements its diet with insects. Being a lowland species,it Is an important frugivore, consuming as many as 42 species offruits from 13 genera in twelve families of plants. As other species of Carolia ,it is strongly associated with species of Piper and Solanum (Solanaceae) but also species of Cecropia (Urticaceae) , Vismia (Hypericaceae) , and Anthurium (Araceae) . It supplements its diet with nectar and pollen during dry season when fruit availability is low and flower production peaks. Due to its abundance, Seba’s Short-tailed Bat can be an important pollinator of Ochroma lagopus ( Malvaceae ), Hymenaea courbaril ( Fabaceae ), Bombacopsis quinata ( Malvaceae ), Ceiba pentandra ( Malvaceae ), Pseudobombax septenatum ( Malvaceae ), Crescentia sp. ( Bignoniaceae ), and Manilkara zapota ( Sapotaceae ) in Costa Rica . Breeding. Seba’s Short-tailed Bat shows bimodal polyestry, with birth peaks in February—May andJune-August in Panama butearlier in Colombia , suggesting a geographically variable pattern that adjusts to local rainfall regimes. In Costa Rica , pregnant and lactating females were observed in February—June and one pregnant female in December. Like other frugivores, Seba’s Short-tailed Bat could have two birth periods: one in the last one-half of dry season and other in middle of wet season. One young is born per pregnancy. Activity patterns. Seba’s Short-tailed Bats leave day roosts to forage soon after sunset, creating an early evening activity peak. No other clear peaks follow. Females and bachelor males commute to feeding areas, with exploratory flights constituting only 1-5% of 393 km collectively flown by 24 tagged individuals. They then search, harvest, and carry a fruit to a feeding roost and repeat these feeding passes 40-50 times per night. They return to day roosts between 03:00 h and 05:00 h, after ingesting at least their own weight in fruit pulp and seeds. They might carry fruits to day roosts at the end of the night. Most individuals forage within 2 km oftheir day roosts. Mean recapture distances vary from 167 m to 310 m and are correlated with body size. Seba’s Shorttailed Bats roost at caves, tunnels, mines, culverts, hollow trees, hollow logs, and houses and under bridges. There is a record of two individuals roosting under banana leaves. When found in caves, Seba’s Short-tailed Bats roost in the darkest or well-lit areas. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Seba’s Short-tailed Bats use understory vegetation, where they concentrate feeding activity on fruits, especially slender, green, candle-like fruits of Piper plants. They are gregarious; groups of ten to more than 100 individuals commonly roost together. Studies in captivity and in the wild indicate that they have a polygynous (harem) social organization. Males defend protected roosting sites where females aggregate, suggesting a resource defense system. Two types of roost sites exist: harem sites used by a single territorial adult male, one or severalfemales, and juvenile offspring and bachelorsites used by adult and subadult males that do not have harems. Young femalesjoin these latter groups seasonally. Only 12-17% of adult males have harems. In captive colonies, harems have 1-5 females; males actively recruit females by hovering and vocalizing, suggesting that females choose harems on the basis of male quality. Territorial males are faithful to a given roost for up to nine months, and harem males defend their territory even in the absence of females. They actively defend their harem from intruders by nosing, wing shaking, and vocalizing. Seba’s Short-tailed Bat has low fecundity. Annual mortality rate is 53% for the first two years of life, and 22% for the following years. Life expectancy is 2-6 yearsat birth, and maximum life expectancy is nearly ten years. Survivorship of males and females is similar. Mother-young communication is mediated through sounds, but olfactory cues might also be important. Seba’s Short-tailed Bat has been observed roosting with at least 35 other bat species in eight families. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Seba’s Short-tailed Bat is locally abundant, has a wide distribution,is very tolerant of various habitats, and occurs in several protected areas throughout its distribution. Bibliography.
