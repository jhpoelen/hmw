They are often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands, from sea level to 1500 m elevation, but mostly below 500 m . However, on the east slopes of the Andes Mountains in Bolivia they range up to 2000 m .

In Venezuela , seven stomachs contained remains of diurnal rodents (Sigmodon alstoni), a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), a dove (Zenaida auriculata), and an eel-like fish. Two other stomachs contained an opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), an unidentified rodent, a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), and an amphibian (Colestethus auriculata). In Para, Brazil , a Greater Grison was observed carrying a large toad (Bufo marinus) in its mouth, apparently unaffected by the toad’s toxic skin glands. In Panama , a Greater Grison was seen pursuing an Agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) at 08:15 h; another Agouti was attacked in a river at midday. In Peru , a Greater Grison was observed eating a piranha-like characin fish. In north-eastern Brazil , Greater Grisons are major predators of Rock Cavies or Mocos (Kerodon rupestris), which they attack in their burrows. The stomachs of two males and two females contained Moco remains and another species of cavy (Galea spixii). Greater Grisons hunt alone, in pairs, or in small family groups. An adult female was seen travelling in association with a nearly grown male and a three-fourths grown female. Activity patterns. Primarily diurnal, but occasionally active at night. A captive male from Ecuador was nearly 100% diurnal, with a rest period of several hours at midday. Three captive Greater Grisons in Panama were very active in the early morning and late afternoon and rested for four to five hours around midday. Greater Grisons forage during the day at Cocha Cashu, Peru . However, in Venezuela , a radio-collared individual was active for 10-12 h per day, mostly at night (77-1% of the time); all sightings were in the daytime (06:00-11:25 h).

Greater Grison Galictis vittata French: Grand Grison / German: Grofser Grison / Spanish: Grison Taxonomy. Viverra vittata Schreber, 1776 , Surinam . Four subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. G. v. vittata Schreber, 1776 — the Guianas and Venezuela . G. v. andina Thomas, 1903 — Bolivia and Peru . G. v. brasiliensis Thunberg, 1820 — Brazil . G. v. canaster Nelson, 1901 — Mexico to Colombia and Ecuador . Descriptive notes. Head-body 47.5-55 cm , tail 16 cm ; weight 1.4-3.3 kg . The Greater Grison has a long body and short limbs. The pelage is smoky gray on the upper sides; the face, throat, undersides, and all four limbs are black. A white stripe extends across the forehead and down the sides of the neck, separating the black of the face from the gray or brown of the back. The skull is strong and massive. Dental formula: I 3/3, C 1/1, P3/3.M1/2=34 Habitat. Greater Grisons are found in virgin and secondary low-elevation rainforests, lower montane forests, upland monte alto forests, tropical dry forests, closed deciduous forests, cerrado, yungas woodlands, shrub woodlands, chaco, palm savannah, secondary growth, open fields, plantations, and partially flooded rice fields adjacent to ranches. They are often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands, from sea level to 1500 m elevation, but mostly below 500 m . However, on the east slopes of the Andes Mountains in Bolivia they range up to 2000 m . A radio-collared female spent 27-8% of her time in open habitats (69-2% of her prey came from there); the remaining 72-2% was spent in closed woodlands and forests (where she obtained 27-8% of her prey). Food and Feeding. The diet includes small mammals, birds, eggs, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and fruit. In Venezuela , seven stomachs contained remains of diurnal rodents (Sigmodon alstoni), a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), a dove (Zenaida auriculata), and an eel-like fish. Two other stomachs contained an opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), an unidentified rodent, a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), and an amphibian (Colestethus auriculata). In Para, Brazil , a Greater Grison was observed carrying a large toad (Bufo marinus) in its mouth, apparently unaffected by the toad’s toxic skin glands. In Panama , a Greater Grison was seen pursuing an Agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) at 08:15 h; another Agouti was attacked in a river at midday. In Peru , a Greater Grison was observed eating a piranha-like characin fish.

One stomach from Kalahari National Park, South Africa , contained mostly reptile remains. In Botswana , twelve stomachs contained insects, reptiles, and small mammals. Most prey are detected by sight or smell, and captured after stalking or short chases. Larger mammals, such as ground squirrels (Xerus) and spring hares, are followed to their burrows and killed. Zorillas often hunt for invertebrates in loose soil, plant debris, and at the base of grass tufts. Typically, a Zorilla pushesits nose into loose soil and sniffs audibly.

Slow prey are bitten directly, whereas faster-moving prey, such as moths, mantids, or beetles, may either be bitten or pinned to the ground with a forefoot and eaten head first. All parts of insects are eaten. Rats (Rattus) are located mainly by sight. On occasion, rats are stalked and quickly captured or are chased. They are captured either by direct biting or by being pinned to the ground with the forefeet and then bitten. Mostkilling bites are directed at the back of the neck, head, or chest. Rats larger than 140 g usually require more bites and pinning with the forefeet. Occasionally, Zorillas roll while biting. Large rats are eaten by biting at the flesh and holding the skin with the forefeet. Birds presented to captive Zorillas are quickly and easily killed by a bite at the head, and then eaten head first. Zorillas will consume young birds completely, but they leave most ofthe feathers, feet, and tibia of mature birds. The contents of broken eggs are readily consumed, but captive Zorillas experience initial difficulty with unbroken eggs. Eventually, they learn to open them by biting or rolling the egg against a hard object such as a rock. Once cracked, the egg is easily opened and consumed. Zorillas will kill snakes and can attack large cobras. Snakes are approached cautiously and bitten on the back several times, after which the Zorilla retreats rapidly. Each bite is directed to the posterior half of the snake and is accompanied by vigorous shaking. After four or five such attacks, the Zorilla pins the snake to the ground with the forefeet, and repeatedly bites 10-15 cm from the head. Some of the bites involve vigorous shaking.

Marbled Polecats may take small poultry. Excess food may be cached for later use. The eyesight of Marbled Polecats is quite weak and they rely principally on a well-developed sense of smell. They have two kinds of killing bites: the first is the penetration of the prey’s body by the canines, and the second is crushing the prey without canine penetration. To kill small vertebrate prey, Marbled Polecats crush the thorax. If the prey struggles, they may pin the prey down with the forepaws and deliver headshakes or follow up by a bite to head or neck. On large prey, such as Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcellus), a Marbled Polecat bites the nape of the neck and eventually severs the spinal column at the base of the skull. With rats, it bites the throat.

The North American River Otter has an elongated body, short limbs, and a tail that is flattened dorso-ventrally. The pelage is short and very dense, varying in color from brown to black, with a grayish upper chest, throat, and chin. The rhinarium is bare and there are long vibrissae on each side of the face. All four feet are fully webbed and equipped with small claws. The skull is flat, with a broad rostrum and large braincase. Dental formula: I 3/3, C 1/1, P4/3.M 1/2 =36.","North American River Otters are found along streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and in saltwater marshes. Generally, they prefer waterways with well-vegetated shorelines, and avoid areas with no shoreline vegetation. They inhabit the murky waters of southern alluvial valleys as well as the crystal-clear waters of rocky mountain streams. In many areas, they occur in close association with American Beavers; Beaver ponds provide prey and dens/rest sites.","The diet is mainly fish, but also includes amphibians, crustaceans (especially crayfish), rodents, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and fruits. In many areas, the abundance and availability offish is the primary determinant of North American River Otter abundance. Typically, fish are consumed in inverse proportion to their swimming abilities: slow-moving species are captured and eaten more often. In coastal areas, the fish eaten are those that are abundant, intermediate in size, and found close to shore. North American River Otters hunt by sight and by touch. They inspect logjams, pools of deeper water in shallow streams, areas below waterfalls, natural eddies, or any other areas likely to hold fish and other prey. Upon detection, prey are pursued until captured. In shallow or murky water, North American River Otters hunt and detect prey with their vibrissae or by feeling with their forefeet. They can remain underwater for up to four minutes, and can swim at speeds of 11 km /h. They may hunt in small family groups, herding fish to shore or to each other to facilitate capture. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, with some crepuscular activity; diurnal activity increases during colder months. Active year round, even when water freezes in winter. Rest sites are in dry bank dens, Beaver lodges, or other natural cavities accessible from underwater. Movements, Home range and Social organization. North American River Otters are highly mobile, aquatic animals and can travel more than 40 km in a single day. Daily movements average 4-5 km for males and 2-3 km for females. They typically travel in water and are able to swim long distances under ice during the winter. North American River Otters may travel long distances over land from one watershed to another. When traveling on land, they often slide instead of bounding, especially if snow is present or when going downhill on slippery ground. When sliding, they push forward with their back legs, while the front feet are tucked under the belly. They will also play on steep banks next to water, repeatedly climbing up the bank and sliding back down into the water. North American River Otters have a complex social system, which varies across their range. They often occur in groups of up to 15 individuals; the largest groups are found along coastal shorelines. These groups mainly consist of a female with young. In coastal areas, groups consist either of adult females with young, or male groups. The cohesiveness of male groups disappears during breeding, when each male attempts to find and mate with numerous females. Home ranges may reach 275 km ” for males and 135 km ? for females. In south-eastern Minnesota , annual home ranges of males were 3-2 times greater than those of females, and annual core areas of males were 2-9 times greater than those of females; 69% of the individuals exhibited core-area overlap. In general, conspecifics were not excluded from home ranges or core areas and signs of cooperation were evident, suggesting that they were social rather than territorial.

Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed for eight months; embryonic development lasts 61-63 days. Births occur from February to April, usually in a bank den or an abandoned Beaver lodge. In south-eastern Minnesota , two females used man-made brush piles as maternal dens, four used small limestone caves, one used a cavity in the roots of a big-toothed aspen (Populus grandidentata) and one used a American Beaver bank den. Dens were located a mean of 316 m from the nearest body of water. Seven of eight females placed dens outside of their normal activity areas, and all females appeared to select den sites that were protected from flood events. Litter size is one to five. The young are born furred, blind, and toothless. The eyes open after 30-38 days, and weaning occurs after twelve weeks. Sexual maturity is reached after two years. Males do not provide parental care.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern in The [UCN Red List. North American River Otters are considered to be fairly common throughout their range.

The main fish species eaten are from the suborder Characoidei and are 10-60 cm in length. Other prey items are rare, but may include crabs, small mammals, amphibians, birds, and molluscs. There are records of Giant Otters eating large prey such as anacondas and other snakes, black caimans, and turtles. On the Jauaperi River in the central Brazilian Amazon, remains of fish were found in all spraints. The main fish groups were Perciformes ( Cichlidae , 97-3%), Characiformes (86-5%) and Siluriformes (5-4%). The Characiformes were represented mainly by Erythrinidae ( Hoplias sp. 90-6%), followed by Serrasalmidae (28%). The Anostomidae occurred with a frequency of 18:7%. On the Aquidauana River , the Characiformes were the most frequent fish group, represented in 100% of all samples, followed by Siluriformes (66-6%) and Perciformes (33:3%). Prey is caught with the mouth and held in the forepaws while being consumed. Small fish may be eaten in the water, but larger prey are taken to shore. Activity patterns. Diurnal. Giant Otters frequently go ashore to groom, play or defecate. Rest sites are in burrows, under root systems, or under fallen trees. At certain points along a stream, areas of about 50 m * are cleared and used for resting and grooming. Dens may consist of one or more short tunnels that lead to a chamber about 1-2- 1-8 m wide.

Major threats are habitat degradation, water pollution, and the ever-increasing encroachment of humans on their habitats, which may lead to a potential future reduction in population size of around 50% over the next 20 years. Other threats for this species are the continued illegal killing for their skins or meat, captures for the zoo trade, or robbing of dens for cubs to be sold as pets. There are also conflicts with fishermen as otters are perceived to reduce available fish stock, although studies have shown little overlap in otter prey species and those of commercial interest. Canine diseases that are transferred through domestic livestock, such as parvovirus and distemper, are also a threat. Bibliography.

E. l. kenyoni Wilson, 1991 — Aleutian Is through Alaska and W Canada (Vancouver I) to W USA ( Washington ). E. l. nereis Merriam, 1904 — USA ( California ).","Head-body 100-120 cm , tail 25-37 cm ; weight 21-45 kg (males), 14-33 kg (females). The Sea Otter is one of the largest species within the Mustelidae . Sea Otters have long bodies and short limbs. The pelage is reddish-brown to dark brown, with a gray or creamy-colored head, throat, and chest. The underfur is very dense, averaging 100,000 hairs per cm®. The head is wide and blunt, with long and thick vibrissae on the upper lips. The ears are small and set low to the sides, and capable of closing when the otter dives. The tail is slightly flattened dorso-ventrally, but uniform in thickness from the base to tip. All four feet are webbed and clawed. There is one pair of mammae. A fold of skin in the armpits enables the Sea Otter to transport prey at sea while foraging. The Sea Otter lacks anal glands. The skull is flat, broad and strong. Dental formula: 1 3/2, C 1/1, P 3/3, M 1/2 = 32. The molars are broad and flat, with rounded crowns. This is the only carnivore species with four (instead ofsix) lowerincisors.","Sea Otters are found in coastal marine habitats from sheltered and sandy bays to rocky shorelines exposed to rough seas. Although marine mammals, they rarely venture more than one km from shore. Typically, they live and forage in waters at depths of up to 100 m , but the highest densities of Sea Otters occur in waters less than 40 m deep.","The diet is mostly marine invertebrates such as abalones, sea urchins, crabs, and molluscs. Other prey include squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, scallops, and, very occasionally, fish. In the northern Kodiak Archipelago, clams were the most frequently identified prey (57-67%, mostly Saxidomus giganteus); mussels (Mytilus sp.), crabs (primarily Telmessus sp.), and green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) contributed 25% to the diet. On the north side of the Alaska Peninsula, the dominant prey species in 50 spraints were mussels (Mytilus edulis), followed by three species of clams (Siliqua sp., Spisula polynyma, and Tellina lutea), sand dollars (Echinarachnius parma), and helmet crabs (Telmessus cheiragonus). In south-east Alaska , butter clams (S. giganteus) are the major prey items. Sea Otters on the outer coast of Washington feed heavily on bivalves (63%) and have a diverse diet consisting of several prey groups. In contrast, Sea Otters in the Strait ofJuan de Fuca have a restricted diet dominated by more than 60% red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), with only two other prey species comprising more than 10% of their diet. Sea Otters forage in both rocky and soft-sediment areas on or near the ocean floor. They have good underwater vision and most prey is captured by sight. Prey hiding under rocks or in crevices may also be captured by feeling with the forefeet. Underwater dives are sustained by lungs that are 2-3 times larger than those of similarsized terrestrial mammals. Most hunting dives last 50-90 seconds. In coastal Washington , the average dive time was 55 seconds and average surface time was 45 seconds, irrespective of dive success. At least 77% of all dives were successful in capturing prey. Prey capture success was significantly lower for subadults (63%) than adults (82%). Sea Otters break the exoskeleton of large or hard-shelled prey by hitting the prey item on a rock carried by the otter on its belly. Sea Otters face a tremendous thermoregulatory challenge because of their constant life at sea. When in water, buoyancy and insulation are provided by their fur and the air bubbles trapped within it. The integrity of their pelage is thus essential to thermoregulation. Their metabolic heat production is 2-3 times greater than that of similar-sized terrestrial mammals. To sustain such heat production requires that Sea Otters consume 20-33% of their body mass in food daily. Sea Otters can drink seawater, and their kidneys produce very concentrated urine to avoid unnecessary water loss. Activity patterns. Generally diurnal, with peaks in activity at dawn and dusk. Daytime foraging increases when females care for young. In Prince William Sound, Alaska , more time was spent foraging (30%) than on any other activity, and foraging bouts were longer than all other activities. Sea Otters rest by floating belly-up in the water with their feet out of the water. They sometimes rest on rocks near the water and often spend the night in a kelp bed, lying under strands of kelp to avoid drifting while sleeping. Ten vocalizations have been described for Sea Otters including screams of distress (heard especially when mothers and young are separated) and coos (heard mostly when individuals are content or in familiar company). Movements, Home range and Social organization. Sea Otters can spend their entire life at sea, and their movements on land are awkward. In the water, they are graceful and can move at speeds of 1- 1-5 km /h at the surface and up to 9 km /h underwater. Annual total movements of both sexes frequently cover 50-100 km . Sea Otters are basically solitary, but they sometimes rest in concentrations of up to 2000 individuals, and groups may occur at feeding areas. They aggregate by sex and age, with males and females occupying separate sections of coastline. During the breeding season, some males move into the areas occupied by females and establish territories. Male territories are usually about 20-50 ha; female home ranges may be twice as large. These territories typically are located in prime feeding or resting areas, locations that are attractive to breeding females. The boundaries are vigorously patrolled and intruding males are repulsed, but serious fighting is rare. The ownerofa territory seeks to mate with any female that enters, though sometimes a pair bond is formed for a few days or weeks.",,"Generally diurnal, with peaks in activity at dawn and dusk.

Ten vocalizations have been described for Sea Otters including screams of distress (heard especially when mothers and young are separated) and coos (heard mostly when individuals are content or in familiar company).","Sea Otters can spend their entire life at sea, and their movements on land are awkward. In the water, they are graceful and can move at speeds of 1- 1-5 km /h at the surface and up to 9 km /h underwater. Annual total movements of both sexes frequently cover 50-100 km . Sea Otters are basically solitary, but they sometimes rest in concentrations of up to 2000 individuals, and groups may occur at feeding areas. They aggregate by sex and age, with males and females occupying separate sections of coastline. During the breeding season, some males move into the areas occupied by females and establish territories. Male territories are usually about 20-50 ha; female home ranges may be twice as large. These territories typically are located in prime feeding or resting areas, locations that are attractive to breeding females. The boundaries are vigorously patrolled and intruding males are repulsed, but serious fighting is rare. The ownerofa territory seeks to mate with any female that enters, though sometimes a pair bond is formed for a few days or weeks. Breeding. Sea Otters are polygynous: males may mate with more than one female during the season. Mating and births occur throughout the year, but parturition peaks are in May and June in the Aleutians and from January to March off the coast of California . Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed, and total gestation lasts from 4-12 months. Births occur in water. Litter size is one, very rarely two. At birth, neonates weigh 1.4-2.3 kg . The female swims on her back and nurses with the young on her chest. Young Sea Otters may take some solid food shortly after birth, but may nurse until they are almost adult size. The period of dependency on the mother is thought to be about five to eight months. Offspring start diving after two months. Sexual maturity is reached at four years of age. Most females do not have young every year, although some females are capable of annual reproduction. Males may begin mating at five orsix years, but usually do not become active breeders until several more years have passed.","CITES Appendix I and II. Classified as Endangered in The IUCN Red List.

Mustela lutris Linnaeus, 1758 , Kamchatka , Russia . Three subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. E. l. lutris Linnaeus, 1758 — NE Russia (Commander Is, Kamchatka , Kurile Is & Sakhalin I). E. l. kenyoni Wilson, 1991 — Aleutian Is through Alaska and W Canada (Vancouver I) to W USA ( Washington ). E. l. nereis Merriam, 1904 — USA ( California ). Descriptive notes. Head-body 100-120 cm , tail 25-37 cm ; weight 21-45 kg (males), 14-33 kg (females). The Sea Otter is one of the largest species within the Mustelidae . Sea Otters have long bodies and short limbs. The pelage is reddish-brown to dark brown, with a gray or creamy-colored head, throat, and chest. The underfur is very dense, averaging 100,000 hairs per cm®. The head is wide and blunt, with long and thick vibrissae on the upper lips. The ears are small and set low to the sides, and capable of closing when the otter dives. The tail is slightly flattened dorso-ventrally, but uniform in thickness from the base to tip. All four feet are webbed and clawed. There is one pair of mammae. A fold of skin in the armpits enables the Sea Otter to transport prey at sea while foraging. The Sea Otter lacks anal glands. The skull is flat, broad and strong. Dental formula: 1 3/2, C 1/1, P 3/3, M 1/2 = 32. The molars are broad and flat, with rounded crowns. This is the only carnivore species with four (instead ofsix) lowerincisors. Habitat. Sea Otters are found in coastal marine habitats from sheltered and sandy bays to rocky shorelines exposed to rough seas. Although marine mammals, they rarely venture more than one km from shore. Typically, they live and forage in waters at depths of up to 100 m , but the highest densities of Sea Otters occur in waters less than 40 m deep. Food and Feeding. The diet is mostly marine invertebrates such as abalones, sea urchins, crabs, and molluscs. Other prey include squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, scallops, and, very occasionally, fish. In the northern Kodiak Archipelago, clams were the most frequently identified prey (57-67%, mostly Saxidomus giganteus); mussels (Mytilus sp.), crabs (primarily Telmessus sp.), and green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) contributed 25% to the diet. On the north side of the Alaska Peninsula, the dominant prey species in 50 spraints were mussels (Mytilus edulis), followed by three species of clams (Siliqua sp., Spisula polynyma, and Tellina lutea), sand dollars (Echinarachnius parma), and helmet crabs (Telmessus cheiragonus). In south-east Alaska , butter clams (S. giganteus) are the major prey items. Sea Otters on the outer coast of Washington feed heavily on bivalves (63%) and have a diverse diet consisting of several prey groups. In contrast, Sea Otters in the Strait ofJuan de Fuca have a restricted diet dominated by more than 60% red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), with only two other prey species comprising more than 10% of their diet. Sea Otters forage in both rocky and soft-sediment areas on or near the ocean floor. They have good underwater vision and most prey is captured by sight. Prey hiding under rocks or in crevices may also be captured by feeling with the forefeet. Underwater dives are sustained by lungs that are 2-3 times larger than those of similarsized terrestrial mammals. Most hunting dives last 50-90 seconds. In coastal Washington , the average dive time was 55 seconds and average surface time was 45 seconds, irrespective of dive success. At least 77% of all dives were successful in capturing prey. Prey capture success was significantly lower for subadults (63%) than adults (82%). Sea Otters break the exoskeleton of large or hard-shelled prey by hitting the prey item on a rock carried by the otter on its belly. Sea Otters face a tremendous thermoregulatory challenge because of their constant life at sea. When in water, buoyancy and insulation are provided by their fur and the air bubbles trapped within it. The integrity of their pelage is thus essential to thermoregulation. Their metabolic heat production is 2-3 times greater than that of similar-sized terrestrial mammals. To sustain such heat production requires that Sea Otters consume 20-33% of their body mass in food daily. Sea Otters can drink seawater, and their kidneys produce very concentrated urine to avoid unnecessary water loss. Activity patterns. Generally diurnal, with peaks in activity at dawn and dusk. Daytime foraging increases when females care for young. In Prince William Sound, Alaska , more time was spent foraging (30%) than on any other activity, and foraging bouts were longer than all other activities. Sea Otters rest by floating belly-up in the water with their feet out of the water. They sometimes rest on rocks near the water and often spend the night in a kelp bed, lying under strands of kelp to avoid drifting while sleeping. Ten vocalizations have been described for Sea Otters including screams of distress (heard especially when mothers and young are separated) and coos (heard mostly when individuals are content or in familiar company). Movements, Home range and Social organization. Sea Otters can spend their entire life at sea, and their movements on land are awkward.

The Eurasian Otter has a long body and a conical tail. The short, dense pelage is brown to almost black throughout, with slightly paler undersides. The legs are short; the feet are fully webbed and have well-developed claws. There are two to three pairs of mammae. The cranium is large and flat. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/3, M 1/2 = 36.","Eurasian Otters are found along lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams, and in marshes, swamps, and coastal and estuarine wetlands, from sea level up to 4120 m . They avoid areas of deep water.","The diet is mainly fish, frogs, and aquatic invertebrates (including crustaceans and crabs). Birds and small mammals (such as rodents and lagomorphs) may be consumed on occasion. In general, the mean proportion offish declines from 94% on seashores, to 71% on lakes and fish ponds, to 64% on rivers and streams. On inland waters, the abundance of crayfish is an essential food item. In Northern Ireland , over 50% of spraints were composed of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), salmonids and cyprinids, with Sticklebacks constituting the most frequently occurring prey category. The frequency of occurrence of eels ( Anguilla anguilla) was found to be consistently higher in spraints collected from smaller streams. In eastern Poland ,fish constitutes 51% of the food biomass consumed in spring-summer and 40% in autumnwinter, with perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) being captured most frequently. Amphibians (mainly Rana temporaria) make up 34% of the food biomass in spring-summer and 58% in autumn-winter. The cold season diet depends on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, Eurasian Otters feed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of the river increases, and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forests), Eurasian Otters shift to catching predominantly fish (up to 76%). In southern Poland , the main component of the diet is fish (47-9%, including brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss). Other important food items are 21-4% frogs ( R . temporaria) and 30% birds, small mammals, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and plant debris. In southern Italy , spraint analysis revealed that fish represented the dominant food (57-3% mean volume), followed by amphibians (18:9%) and crayfish (15-6%). Seasonal variations in fish consumption were related to changes in fish activity and to environmental conditions; the importance of fish decreased in winter, when flooding increased water speeds and turbidity, and thus reduced the hunting efficiency of the otters. Hibernating amphibians represented a primary alternative resource. Insects and reptiles were eaten more frequently in summer, while birds predominated during their breeding season. In Hungary , the primary food is fish (89-8% for riverine and 87-5% for backwater habitats); Eurasian Otters living in riverine habitats, compared to backwaters, consume more birds (3-9% and 0-7%, respectively), less mammals (0-5% and 0-9%, respectively), less reptiles and amphibians (5-6% and 10-2%, respectively) and less invertebrates (0-1% and 0-6%, respectively); most fish eaten are small-sized (below 100 g ), and the most frequently taken species is Carassius sp. In Iran , the major food items are 38-1% chub (Alburnoides bipunctatus) and 34-8% carp (Cyprinus carpio). Prey are captured with the mouth, but the forepaws are used to handle the prey for consumption. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, but can also be active during the day. Den/restsites are in burrows, among root systems, log jams, or in rock crevices, in close proximity to water. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Eurasian Otters are excellent swimmers and divers. They are usually found no more than a few hundred meters from water, but they may travel several kilometers overland between wetlands. They swim using movements of the hindlegs and tail; usually dives last one or two minutes,five at the most. When traveling on the ground, snow, or ice they may use a combination of running and sliding. Males typically are solitary, whereas females may occur in groups, either with their own young or with unrelated, reproductive females and their young. The straight-line length of a home range may reach an average of 15 km for males and 7 km for females. Males and femalestypically defend their range against members of the same sex, but the home ranges of males may overlap those of several females. Population densities may be one otter per 2-3 km of lakeshore or 5 km ofriver.",,"Mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, but can also be active during the day.

There are two to three pairs of mammae. The cranium is large and flat. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/3, M 1/2 = 36. Habitat. Eurasian Otters are found along lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams, and in marshes, swamps, and coastal and estuarine wetlands, from sea level up to 4120 m . They avoid areas of deep water. Food and Feeding. The diet is mainly fish, frogs, and aquatic invertebrates (including crustaceans and crabs). Birds and small mammals (such as rodents and lagomorphs) may be consumed on occasion. In general, the mean proportion offish declines from 94% on seashores, to 71% on lakes and fish ponds, to 64% on rivers and streams. On inland waters, the abundance of crayfish is an essential food item. In Northern Ireland , over 50% of spraints were composed of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), salmonids and cyprinids, with Sticklebacks constituting the most frequently occurring prey category. The frequency of occurrence of eels ( Anguilla anguilla) was found to be consistently higher in spraints collected from smaller streams. In eastern Poland ,fish constitutes 51% of the food biomass consumed in spring-summer and 40% in autumnwinter, with perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) being captured most frequently. Amphibians (mainly Rana temporaria) make up 34% of the food biomass in spring-summer and 58% in autumn-winter. The cold season diet depends on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, Eurasian Otters feed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of the river increases, and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forests), Eurasian Otters shift to catching predominantly fish (up to 76%). In southern Poland , the main component of the diet is fish (47-9%, including brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss). Other important food items are 21-4% frogs ( R . temporaria) and 30% birds, small mammals, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and plant debris. In southern Italy , spraint analysis revealed that fish represented the dominant food (57-3% mean volume), followed by amphibians (18:9%) and crayfish (15-6%). Seasonal variations in fish consumption were related to changes in fish activity and to environmental conditions; the importance of fish decreased in winter, when flooding increased water speeds and turbidity, and thus reduced the hunting efficiency of the otters. Hibernating amphibians represented a primary alternative resource. Insects and reptiles were eaten more frequently in summer, while birds predominated during their breeding season. In Hungary , the primary food is fish (89-8% for riverine and 87-5% for backwater habitats); Eurasian Otters living in riverine habitats, compared to backwaters, consume more birds (3-9% and 0-7%, respectively), less mammals (0-5% and 0-9%, respectively), less reptiles and amphibians (5-6% and 10-2%, respectively) and less invertebrates (0-1% and 0-6%, respectively); most fish eaten are small-sized (below 100 g ), and the most frequently taken species is Carassius sp. In Iran , the major food items are 38-1% chub (Alburnoides bipunctatus) and 34-8% carp (Cyprinus carpio). Prey are captured with the mouth, but the forepaws are used to handle the prey for consumption. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, but can also be active during the day. Den/restsites are in burrows, among root systems, log jams, or in rock crevices, in close proximity to water. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Eurasian Otters are excellent swimmers and divers. They are usually found no more than a few hundred meters from water, but they may travel several kilometers overland between wetlands. They swim using movements of the hindlegs and tail; usually dives last one or two minutes,five at the most. When traveling on the ground, snow, or ice they may use a combination of running and sliding. Males typically are solitary, whereas females may occur in groups, either with their own young or with unrelated, reproductive females and their young. The straight-line length of a home range may reach an average of 15 km for males and 7 km for females. Males and femalestypically defend their range against members of the same sex, but the home ranges of males may overlap those of several females. Population densities may be one otter per 2-3 km of lakeshore or 5 km ofriver. Breeding. Females are polyestrous, with the cycle lasting four to six weeks; estrus lasts about two weeks. Mating typically occurs in late winter or early spring. The gestation period is 60-63 days and births peak in April or May. The main entrance of bank burrows may open underwater and then slope upward into the bank to a nest chamber that is above the high-water level. Litter size is one to five, usually two to three. The young are born blind and weigh about 130 g at birth. They open their eyes after one month and emerge from the den and begin to swim at two months. They nurse for three to four months and separate from the mother at about one year. Sexual maturity is attained after two or three years. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened in The IUCN Red List. The Japanese Otter, once common, has no recent confirmed sightings and may be extinct. Eurasian Otters are vulnerable to water pollution because their bodies accumulate contaminants and heavy metals, which affect reproduction. They also are killed accidentally on roads and deliberately for their fur. Bibliography. Chruszcz et al. (2007), Conroy et al.

Insects and birds are also occasionally eaten. Crabs are the major dietary item during spring, summer, and autumn, whereas fish dominate in winter. Most fish consumed are less than 20 cm in length. In the fish-rich waters of east and central Africa, the diet consists almost entirely of fish, whereas in the fish-poor waters of South Africa , crabs and frogs are consumed in addition to fish. On Lake Victoria, Tanzania , 61% of spraints collected contained 46% Haplochromis , 14% Tilapia , catfish (Bagrus or Clarias), and 1% crab (Potamon niloticus). Direct observations of feeding Spottednecked Otters also revealed a diet dominated by Haplochromis . On Lake Muhazi, Rwanda , 154 spraints contained 80% fish, 10% insects, 3% molluscs, 2% birds and frogs. In Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet is mostly fish (47%), crabs (38%), and frogs (8%). In KwaZulu-Natal , the frequency of occurrence of food items in 516 spraints was 64% fish, 43% crabs, 43% amphibians, and 18% insects. In contrast, 228 spraints collected near a troutriver contained 39% crabs, 38% fish, 20% frogs, 2% insects (mostly dragonfly larvae, Odonata), and unidentified birds. In a non-trout area, 66 spraints contained 30% crabs, 27% frogs, 25% fish, 10% birds (mostly Anatidae and little grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis), and 5% insects. In three stomachs from the Cape Province , South Africa , one contained crabs, one contained frogs and fish, and one contained frogs,fish, a beetle (Coleoptera), and a caterpillar. Spotted-necked Otters generally fish alone and almost all fishing is done within 10 m from the shore. When fishing in groups, cooperation among individuals may help facilitate prey capture by herding fish toward each other. Fishing in groups probably occurs when females are training their young. Fish are captured during short dives of less than 20 seconds. Once underwater, a Spotted-necked Otter scans for prey, turning its head from side to side. Prey are detected visually and pursued until captured. Crabs, fish, and frogs are captured with the mouth; the forefeet are not used in prey capture. Fish smaller than 10 cm are consumed in the water, but larger fish are taken to shore for consumption. Fishing forays typically last 10-20 minutes, but may last up to 3 h. Activity patterns. Mostly diurnal, with activity peaks during early morning and late afternoon. In KwaZulu-Natal , Spotted-necked Otters were most active from 06:00-09:00 h and 15:00-21:00 h. Nocturnal activity usually only occurs during periods of full moon. Rest sites are in rock cavities, bank dens, holes in root systems, or dense vegetation. Spotted-necked Otters can dig their own burrows. In KwaZulu-Natal , resting sites were among trees and shrub roots (29%), reeds (21%), small islands near dams (23%), tall grass (14%), swamps (11%), and sheltered places among rocks (2%). A 4-2-km section of river contained ten resting sites, with a mean distance of 467 m between dens. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Spotted-necked Otters travel mostly in water, swimming underwater and surfacing briefly to breathe. Swimming speed reaches 3—4 km /h.

The African Clawless Otteris large and heavily built. The pelage is dark brown to black throughout, but the sides of the face, neck and throat are white or pale gray. There is a quadrangular dark brown patch between the eye and the nose; the cheeks are white. The hindfeet are partially webbed, but the front feet are not. The toes are clawless except for the three middle toes of each hindfoot, which bear small grooming claws. The cheek teeth are smaller in congicus than in capensis . Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/3, M 1/2 = 36.","African Clawless Otters are mainly found in rainforests and lowland swamp forests, but may also inhabit forested rivers and streams in open coastal plains and semi-arid country. They occur mostly in fresh water; some populations inhabit saltwater coasts, but because they require fresh water to drink, even coastal populations occur near freshwater tributaries. They also occupy many natural or man-made lakes and reservoirs, but prefer areas of shallow water. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters prefer riverine habitats covered with dense vegetation, while areas of short grass are avoided. They also select areas with boulders and/or reed beds, which provide high crab density and shelter. In southern Nigeria , African Clawless Otters are mainly restricted to brackish streams (with mangrove vegetation along the banks) and, more occasionally, transitional habitats between freshwater and brackish-water environments.","African Clawless Otters are primarily crab eaters, but other foods such as frogs, fish, and insects are consumed. Fish increases in importance in the diet during winter, when they are lethargic and easier to capture. Lobsters, octopus, and shellfish are eaten along the seacoast. In two reserves in the Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet was more varied at Mkambati (15 prey species) than Dwessa (seven species). In terms of relative percentage frequency of occurrence, the spiny lobster (Panulirus homarus) was found to be the most common prey item at both Mkambati (37-9%) and at Dwessa (35-2%), followed by fish (31% and 36-6%, respectively), crabs (22:4% and 19-7%) and molluscs (3-1% and 4-2%). Lobster and fish are relatively abundant within these reserves, suggesting prey availability rather than selective feeding influenced diet. At another site in the Eastern Cape Province , the three most common prey categories found in otter spraints were the crab Potamonaules perlatus (51%), insects (19%), and the fish Tilapia sparrmanii (18%). At Betty’s Bay, South Africa , fish are the most important prey category (59% of the biomass), followed by octopus (15%), red rock crab Plagusia chabrus (13%), cape lobsterJasus lalandii (10%), and the brown rock crab Cyclograpsus punctatus (0-8%). In eastern Zimbabwe , the diet is mainly the river crab Potamon perlatus (42%). African Clawless Otters use various hunting methods. In shallow or murky water, they detect crabs with their forefeet as they feel around underwater rock crevices. Prey is grabbed with the forefeet and then bitten and eaten. In shallow but clear water, African Clawless Otters may immerse their heads and scan for prey visually while feeling under rocks with the forefeet. In deeper water, they dive straight down and can remain underwater for up to 50 seconds. African Clawless Otters eat small prey while they swim upright at the surface, whereas larger prey are taken to shore for consumption. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters were observed to select open water within 8 m of the shore. Foraging involved moving into shallow water (c. 0-2 m deep) and walking along the substrate feeling for prey with the forefeet. African Clawless Otters prefer hunting at depths of 0-5- 1- 5 m. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but may be active during the day in areas remote from human disturbance. Rest sites are in burrows (holts), under large rocks or root systems, or in dense vegetation near water; they may dig their own burrows. In South Africa , the occurrence of spraints, couches and resting places is closely tied to freshwater sources; holts are located adjacent to river banks, oxbow lakes, or dam shores, and spraint sites are found in dense, tall grass cover beside water less than 1 m deep.

African Clawless Otter Aonyx capensis French: Loutre a joues blanches / German: Fingerotter / Spanish: Nutria africana Other common names: Cape Clawless Otter , Congo Clawless Otter Taxonomy. Lutra capensis Schinz, 1821 , Cape of Good Hope. The Congo Clawless Otter ( Aonyx congicus ) is considered a separate species by some authors, based on morphological and ecological evidence; however, further research is needed to determine its taxonomic status. It is here included as a subspecies of A. capensis . Two subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. A. c. capensis Schinz, 1821 — Sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal in the W to E Ethiopia , and E Africa to Western Cape. Absent from Congo Basin and the most arid zones of Namibia , Botswana , and South Africa . A. c. congicus Lonnberg, 1910 — Congo Basin in WC Africa. Descriptive notes. Head-body 76.2-88 cm (males), 73-73.6 cm (females), tail 46-5— 51- 5 cm (males), 49.5-51.5 cm (females); weight 10-21 kg (males), 10.6-16.3 kg (females), adult males are larger and heavier than females. The African Clawless Otteris large and heavily built. The pelage is dark brown to black throughout, but the sides of the face, neck and throat are white or pale gray. There is a quadrangular dark brown patch between the eye and the nose; the cheeks are white. The hindfeet are partially webbed, but the front feet are not. The toes are clawless except for the three middle toes of each hindfoot, which bear small grooming claws. The cheek teeth are smaller in congicus than in capensis . Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/3, M 1/2 = 36. Habitat. African Clawless Otters are mainly found in rainforests and lowland swamp forests, but may also inhabit forested rivers and streams in open coastal plains and semi-arid country. They occur mostly in fresh water; some populations inhabit saltwater coasts, but because they require fresh water to drink, even coastal populations occur near freshwater tributaries. They also occupy many natural or man-made lakes and reservoirs, but prefer areas of shallow water. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters prefer riverine habitats covered with dense vegetation, while areas of short grass are avoided. They also select areas with boulders and/or reed beds, which provide high crab density and shelter. In southern Nigeria , African Clawless Otters are mainly restricted to brackish streams (with mangrove vegetation along the banks) and, more occasionally, transitional habitats between freshwater and brackish-water environments. Food and Feeding. African Clawless Otters are primarily crab eaters, but other foods such as frogs, fish, and insects are consumed. Fish increases in importance in the diet during winter, when they are lethargic and easier to capture. Lobsters, octopus, and shellfish are eaten along the seacoast. In two reserves in the Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet was more varied at Mkambati (15 prey species) than Dwessa (seven species). In terms of relative percentage frequency of occurrence, the spiny lobster (Panulirus homarus) was found to be the most common prey item at both Mkambati (37-9%) and at Dwessa (35-2%), followed by fish (31% and 36-6%, respectively), crabs (22:4% and 19-7%) and molluscs (3-1% and 4-2%). Lobster and fish are relatively abundant within these reserves, suggesting prey availability rather than selective feeding influenced diet. At another site in the Eastern Cape Province , the three most common prey categories found in otter spraints were the crab Potamonaules perlatus (51%), insects (19%), and the fish Tilapia sparrmanii (18%). At Betty’s Bay, South Africa , fish are the most important prey category (59% of the biomass), followed by octopus (15%), red rock crab Plagusia chabrus (13%), cape lobsterJasus lalandii (10%), and the brown rock crab Cyclograpsus punctatus (0-8%). In eastern Zimbabwe , the diet is mainly the river crab Potamon perlatus (42%). African Clawless Otters use various hunting methods. In shallow or murky water, they detect crabs with their forefeet as they feel around underwater rock crevices. Prey is grabbed with the forefeet and then bitten and eaten. In shallow but clear water, African Clawless Otters may immerse their heads and scan for prey visually while feeling under rocks with the forefeet. In deeper water, they dive straight down and can remain underwater for up to 50 seconds. African Clawless Otters eat small prey while they swim upright at the surface, whereas larger prey are taken to shore for consumption. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters were observed to select open water within 8 m of the shore. Foraging involved moving into shallow water (c. 0-2 m deep) and walking along the substrate feeling for prey with the forefeet. African Clawless Otters prefer hunting at depths of 0-5- 1- 5 m.

In Perak , Malaysia , Smooth-coated Otters eat mostly fish (82% of spraints, mainly Trichogaster pectoralis), followed by molluscs, mammals, and insects (Coleoptera). In Thailand , 70% of spraints contained fish, 13% amphibians, 11% crabs, 4% snakes, and 2% arthropods. Smooth-coated Otters forage in the less rocky areas of lake shallows. Most foraging activity occurs in water; they go on land to rest and defecate. Small fish are swallowed whole, but large fish are taken to shore. Activity patterns. Mainly diurnal, with a rest period around midday. Den /rest sites occur under tree roots, in openings created by piles of boulders, or in dense vegetation. Smooth-coated Otters often dig their own dens and they sometimes rest on bare sand and grassy areas along river banks. In Nepal , eight dens were in exposed tree roots and one was a tunnel in the sand. In India and Nepal , dens are found in swamps; these are sometimes used as natal den sites and nurseries. Spraint sites often smell of rotten fish. In Thailand , spraint sites occur on small rocks, sand banks, and large boulders, 1-3 m above water level. The mean number of spraints on each site was 2-2. Smooth-coated Otters often roll and rub on grassy areas, especially after defecation. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Smooth-coated Otters are excellent swimmers and are able to swim underwater for long distances. They are social and are often seen in groups of up to eleven individuals; groups typically consist of a mated pair with young from previouslitters. It is estimated that a group of Smooth-coated Otters requires 7-12 km ofriver to sustain their needs. Population density is 1-1-3 otters per km of water. Breeding. In India and Nepal , mating occurs in the winter (October—February). Gestation lasts 60-63 days. Littersize is one to five. The young are born blind; the eyes open after ten days. Weaning occurs after three to five months. Adult size is reached after one year and sexual maturity after two to three years. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Vulnerable in The IUCN Red Last. Although the Smooth-coated Otter may have been quite common in the past and populations stable,it is now likely this is changing rapidly and that this species will soon be in need of urgent help. Increasing human population acrossits range is putting the Smooth-coated Otter under pressure through habitat destruction and pollution. There is widespread conflict with aquaculturalists and fishermen, who kill them as pests and competitors. There is also deliberate trapping for fur in India , Nepal , and Bangladesh , mainly for export to China . Although legally protected throughoutits range, this is weakly enforced. Movements of Smooth-coated Otters are limited due to arid regions, leading to poor dispersal and population fragmentation. Several authorities have recommended that ex situ as well as in situ conservation efforts should be made. Field studies are needed to learn more about its natural history, ecology, and conservationstatus. Bibliography.

The Ermine has a long, slender body and short limbs. Except in certain southern parts of their range, Ermines change color in April-May and October-November. In the summer, the back, flanks, and outersides of the limbs are reddish or chocolate brown; the underparts are white and the tip of the tail is black. During winter, the pelage becomes white throughout except for the black tip of the tail. There are four pairs of mammae. The skull has a long braincase, inflated tympanic bullae, and is relatively flat. Dental formula: I 3/3, Cl/A.P3/3:;M1/2=34.","Ermines are found in a wide range of habitats, including tundra, alpine meadows, woodlands, marshes, mountains, riparian habitats, farmland, and hedgerows, from sea level up to 3000 m . They prefer areas with vegetative or rocky cover. In the mountains of south-east British Columbia, Ermines were detected in all forests surveyed; these covered the range from open dry Douglas-fir forests to dense wet western red cedar (Thwa plicata) and western hemlock (75uga heterophylla) forests, and from very recent clear-cuts to mature stands over 300 years in age. In a subarctic area in Finland , adult females were found to live in areas where the abundance of their preferred Microtus prey was the highest; dominant males lived in less productive habitats than females, but in more productive areas than non-dominant mature males.","The diet consists mainly of small mammals, such as voles, mice, rats, lemmings, squirrels, and lagomorphs, but also includes birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, snakes, insects, earthworms, and fruit. In Great Britain , the percentage frequency of occurrence in the diet consists of 65% lagomorphs, 16% small rodents, and 17% birds and birds’ eggs; males eat a greater proportion of lagomorphs than females, which eat more small rodents. In Denmark (where European Rabbits are absent), a dietary study showed that rodents are the most important prey group, constituting 84% of their diet (frequency of occurrence). Ermines ate birds and birds’ eggs more often than sympatric Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more insectivores. Ermines ate more Microtus voles and Water Voles than Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more Bank Voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and Moles (Talpa europaea). In the Italian Alps, 60% of scats contained small rodents, indicating that they were the main prey. However, the frequency of occurrence offruits in the diet increased significantly in August, after rodent biomass had dropped by more than 50% in July. In the forests of New Brunswick , Canada , the frequency of occurrence of prey is 28-0% soricids, 24:6% arvicolines, and 17-3% cricetines; the Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus, 17-3%) and shrews (Sorex sp., 28-:0%) have the highest percent occurrence, whereas the Red Squirrel and the Eastern Chipmunk (7amius striatus ) comprise 11-2% of the diet. Ermines generally hunt in a zig-zag pattern, progressing by a series of leaps that are up to 50 cm long. Prey are located mostly by smell or sound, and are often pursued into underground burrows or under snow. Ermines usually kill prey by biting the base of the skull. They sometimes attack animals considerably larger than themselves, such as adult hares. Ermines may cache excess food underground for later use during the winter. On following pages: 42.

Primarily nocturnal, but can be active at any time during the day. Their long shape makes them sensitive to cold temperatures and this, combined with a high metabolic rate, requires that Ermines hunt constantly to fulfill their energetic demands. Short periods of activity and rest alternate every three to five hours. Dens/ rest sites are in crevices, among tree roots, in hollow logs, or in burrows taken over from a rodent. Several nests are maintained within an individual’s home range; these are lined with dry vegetation or the fur and feathers of its prey. Ermines can easily run over or tunnel in snow to escape predators and search for food. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Ermines are solitary and primarily terrestrial, but they are also agile tree climbers and strong swimmers. Daily movements may reach 15 km , but usually average c. 1 km . Movements increase when prey are rare or dispersed. Home ranges may reach 200 ha, but are typically 10-40 ha; male ranges are generally larger than female ranges. Both sexes maintain exclusive territories, but a male home range may overlap one or more female ranges. Males show a marked seasonal shift in their social organization from a pattern of intra-sexual territories during the non-breeding season (autumn and winter) to a non-territorial pattern with extensive and overlapping ranges during the mating season (spring and summer).

Females are polyestrous, but produce only one litter per year; the estrous cycle is four weeks. Mating occurs in late spring or early summer, but implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed for 9-10 months. Embryonic development is just over one month. Births occur in April or May in the Northern Hemisphere and around October in New Zealand . Litter size may reach 18, but typically is four to eight. Neonates are born blind, naked, and weigh 2-7-4- 2 g . Their eyes open after four to six weeks. Solid food is taken after four or five weeks, though lactation may continue until weeks seven to twelve. They grow rapidly and by eight weeks are able to hunt with their mother. At two to three months, their permanent detention is complete. Females reach adult size at six months. They attain sexual maturity at two to three months and sometimes mate during their first summer. Males attain full size and sexual maturity after one year.","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Ermines are considered common throughout their distribution. They rarely molest poultry and are valuable to humans because they prey on mice and rats. However, Ermines are considered pests in New Zealand , where they were introduced to control rabbits but subsequently decimated populations of native birds. On the Iberian Peninsula, the Ermine is dependent on two Arvicola species, which are declining in numbers. Ermines are trapped in North America and Russia for their fur; the white winter fur has long been used in trimming coats and making stoles.","Edwards & Forbes (2003) | EImeros (2006) | Erlinge & Sandell (1986) | Hellstedt & Henttonen (2006) | Hellstedt et al.

Descriptive notes. Head-body 22: 5-34 cm (males), 19-29 cm (females); tail 4.2-12 cm ; weight of males is 208-283 ¢ in Europe, 320 g in Britain, 285-356 g in New Zealand (introduced population), 233-365 g in Ireland , 134-191 g in Russia , 56-206 g in North America, adult males are 40-80% larger than females. The Ermine has a long, slender body and short limbs. Except in certain southern parts of their range, Ermines change color in April-May and October-November. In the summer, the back, flanks, and outersides of the limbs are reddish or chocolate brown; the underparts are white and the tip of the tail is black. During winter, the pelage becomes white throughout except for the black tip of the tail. There are four pairs of mammae. The skull has a long braincase, inflated tympanic bullae, and is relatively flat. Dental formula: I 3/3, Cl/A.P3/3:;M1/2=34. Habitat. Ermines are found in a wide range of habitats, including tundra, alpine meadows, woodlands, marshes, mountains, riparian habitats, farmland, and hedgerows, from sea level up to 3000 m . They prefer areas with vegetative or rocky cover. In the mountains of south-east British Columbia, Ermines were detected in all forests surveyed; these covered the range from open dry Douglas-fir forests to dense wet western red cedar (Thwa plicata) and western hemlock (75uga heterophylla) forests, and from very recent clear-cuts to mature stands over 300 years in age. In a subarctic area in Finland , adult females were found to live in areas where the abundance of their preferred Microtus prey was the highest; dominant males lived in less productive habitats than females, but in more productive areas than non-dominant mature males. Food and Feeding. The diet consists mainly of small mammals, such as voles, mice, rats, lemmings, squirrels, and lagomorphs, but also includes birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, snakes, insects, earthworms, and fruit. In Great Britain , the percentage frequency of occurrence in the diet consists of 65% lagomorphs, 16% small rodents, and 17% birds and birds’ eggs; males eat a greater proportion of lagomorphs than females, which eat more small rodents. In Denmark (where European Rabbits are absent), a dietary study showed that rodents are the most important prey group, constituting 84% of their diet (frequency of occurrence). Ermines ate birds and birds’ eggs more often than sympatric Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more insectivores. Ermines ate more Microtus voles and Water Voles than Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more Bank Voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and Moles (Talpa europaea). In the Italian Alps, 60% of scats contained small rodents, indicating that they were the main prey. However, the frequency of occurrence offruits in the diet increased significantly in August, after rodent biomass had dropped by more than 50% in July. In the forests of New Brunswick , Canada , the frequency of occurrence of prey is 28-0% soricids, 24:6% arvicolines, and 17-3% cricetines; the Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus, 17-3%) and shrews (Sorex sp., 28-:0%) have the highest percent occurrence, whereas the Red Squirrel and the Eastern Chipmunk (7amius striatus ) comprise 11-2% of the diet. Ermines generally hunt in a zig-zag pattern, progressing by a series of leaps that are up to 50 cm long. Prey are located mostly by smell or sound, and are often pursued into underground burrows or under snow. Ermines usually kill prey by biting the base of the skull. They sometimes attack animals considerably larger than themselves, such as adult hares. Ermines may cache excess food underground for later use during the winter. On following pages: 42.

Back-striped Weasel ( Mustela strigidorsa); 55. Egyptian Weasel ( Mustela subpalmata ); 56. American Mink ( Neovison vison ); 57. Patagonian Weasel ( Lyncodon patagonicus). Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, but can be active at any time during the day. Their long shape makes them sensitive to cold temperatures and this, combined with a high metabolic rate, requires that Ermines hunt constantly to fulfill their energetic demands. Short periods of activity and rest alternate every three to five hours. Dens/ rest sites are in crevices, among tree roots, in hollow logs, or in burrows taken over from a rodent. Several nests are maintained within an individual’s home range; these are lined with dry vegetation or the fur and feathers of its prey. Ermines can easily run over or tunnel in snow to escape predators and search for food. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Ermines are solitary and primarily terrestrial, but they are also agile tree climbers and strong swimmers. Daily movements may reach 15 km , but usually average c. 1 km . Movements increase when prey are rare or dispersed. Home ranges may reach 200 ha, but are typically 10-40 ha; male ranges are generally larger than female ranges. Both sexes maintain exclusive territories, but a male home range may overlap one or more female ranges. Males show a marked seasonal shift in their social organization from a pattern of intra-sexual territories during the non-breeding season (autumn and winter) to a non-territorial pattern with extensive and overlapping ranges during the mating season (spring and summer). Boundaries are regularly patrolled and scent-marked, and neighbors usually avoid each other. Population density fluctuates with prey abundance and may range from 2-6 individuals per km®. Breeding. Females are polyestrous, but produce only one litter per year; the estrous cycle is four weeks. Mating occurs in late spring or early summer, but implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed for 9-10 months. Embryonic development is just over one month. Births occur in April or May in the Northern Hemisphere and around October in New Zealand . Litter size may reach 18, but typically is four to eight. Neonates are born blind, naked, and weigh 2-7-4- 2 g . Their eyes open after four to six weeks. Solid food is taken after four or five weeks, though lactation may continue until weeks seven to twelve. They grow rapidly and by eight weeks are able to hunt with their mother. At two to three months, their permanent detention is complete. Females reach adult size at six months. They attain sexual maturity at two to three months and sometimes mate during their first summer. Males attain full size and sexual maturity after one year. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Ermines are considered common throughout their distribution. They rarely molest poultry and are valuable to humans because they prey on mice and rats. However, Ermines are considered pests in New Zealand , where they were introduced to control rabbits but subsequently decimated populations of native birds. On the Iberian Peninsula, the Ermine is dependent on two Arvicola species, which are declining in numbers. Ermines are trapped in North America and Russia for their fur; the white winter fur has long been used in trimming coats and making stoles. Bibliography.

They show a preference for open, brushy or grassy areas near water.","The diet consists mainly of rodents (voles, mice, and rats) and other small mammals (such as lagomorphs and squirrels), but birds, eggs, snakes, grasshoppers, and poultry are also occasionally eaten. Because of their larger size, males generally consume larger prey than females. In North America, Long-tailed Weasels feed upon a wide variety of small vertebrates, but concentrate on rodents and rabbits of small to medium size. The diet of tropical Long-tailed Weasels, although not well known,is thought to consist mainly of small mammals, rabbits, and birds and their eggs. Small-sized prey, such as mice and voles, usually are subdued when the weasel throws its body into a tight coil around the prey; these are then killed by a bite to the nape of the neck. Long-tailed Weasels can kill animals larger than themselves, such as rabbits. Large prey is initially grabbed by the most convenient part of the animal before a killing bite is administered. Underground mediumsized prey is subdued by a ventral attack and killed by grasping the throat, which results in suffocation. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, but frequently active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs or stumps, among rocks, or in a burrow taken over from a rodent. Long-tailed Weasels spend large amounts of time exploring holes, crevices, root systems, brush piles, thick vegetation, and under the snow in winter, in search of prey. Movements, Home range and Social organization. [Long-tailed Weasels are solitary and mainly terrestrial, but are also good swimmers and tree climbers. The home ranges of males average larger than those of females, and may include the home ranges of more than one female .

Head-body length, 22-: 8-26 cm (males), 20.3-22.8 cm (females); tail 10.2-15.2 cm (males), 7.6-12.7 cm (females); weight 160-450 g (males), 80-250 g (females), adult males are almost twice the size of females. The Long-tailed Weasel has a long body and short limbs. In Canada and the northern United States , the pelage changes from early October to early December and from late February to late April. During the summer, the upperparts are brown, the underparts are buff, and the tip of the tail is black. In winter, the pelage is white except for the black-tipped tail. Subspecies from the southern USA , Mexico and Central America, have distinctive white or yellow facial markings. The plantar surfaces on the feet are furred. There are four pairs of mammae. The skull is long, with large tympanic bullae. Dental formula: 13/3, Cl/1,P%3/3,M1/2=34. Habitat. [Long-tailed Weasels are found in a wide range of habitats from forested areas to agricultural fields. They show a preference for open, brushy or grassy areas near water. Food and Feeding. The diet consists mainly of rodents (voles, mice, and rats) and other small mammals (such as lagomorphs and squirrels), but birds, eggs, snakes, grasshoppers, and poultry are also occasionally eaten. Because of their larger size, males generally consume larger prey than females. In North America, Long-tailed Weasels feed upon a wide variety of small vertebrates, but concentrate on rodents and rabbits of small to medium size. The diet of tropical Long-tailed Weasels, although not well known,is thought to consist mainly of small mammals, rabbits, and birds and their eggs. Small-sized prey, such as mice and voles, usually are subdued when the weasel throws its body into a tight coil around the prey; these are then killed by a bite to the nape of the neck. Long-tailed Weasels can kill animals larger than themselves, such as rabbits. Large prey is initially grabbed by the most convenient part of the animal before a killing bite is administered. Underground mediumsized prey is subdued by a ventral attack and killed by grasping the throat, which results in suffocation. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, but frequently active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs or stumps, among rocks, or in a burrow taken over from a rodent. Long-tailed Weasels spend large amounts of time exploring holes, crevices, root systems, brush piles, thick vegetation, and under the snow in winter, in search of prey. Movements, Home range and Social organization. [Long-tailed Weasels are solitary and mainly terrestrial, but are also good swimmers and tree climbers. The home ranges of males average larger than those of females, and may include the home ranges of more than one female . During the breeding season, the home ranges of males increase in size, allowing more frequent contact with females. There is little overlap of the home ranges of males. In Kentucky , home ranges vary from 0-16 to 0-24 km * during summer, and 0-10 to 0-18 km ? during winter. In Indiana , the mean home range for males was 1-80 km * and for females 0-52 km *. The hourly rate of movement for males (130- 5 m ) was greater than that of females (79- 2 m ). Estimates of densities vary widely by habitat and prey availability. Reported population densities are: 0-004-0-008 /ha in western Colorado , 0-02-0-18/ha in Kentucky , 0-19-0-38/ha in chestnut-oak forest and 0-07-0-09/ha in scrub oak-pitch pine forest in Pennsylvania , and 0-2-0-3/ha in cattail marsh in Ontario . Breeding. Females are monoestrous. Mating occurs in July and August. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterusis delayed until the following March; embryonic development is approximately 27 days. Births occur in April or May. Litter size is up to nine, but is usually around six. The young are born blind and weigh about 3 g at birth. They open their eyes after 35-37 days and are weaned at around 3% weeks. Females attain sexual maturity at three to four months, but males do not mate until the year following their birth. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. The Long-tailed Weasel is considered to be common throughout most ofits distribution; however, several subspecies are considered uncommon. It is able to occupy a wide variety of habitats and can live in close proximity to humans. Long-tailed Weasels are more prone to raid henhouses that other species of Mustela , but they are generally beneficial because they prey on rats and mice. They are trapped in North America for their white winter fur. Bibliography. Gehring & Swihart (2004), King (1990), Sheffield & Thomas (1997), Svendsen (2003), Wozencraft (2005)."

The Honey Badger is a short, stocky animal, with strong limbs and a short tail. The upperparts, from the top of the head to the base of the tail, are gray to pale yellow or whitish, and contrast sharply with the dark brown or black of the underparts. Completely black individuals have been reported from some parts of Africa. The tail is black, with a gray or white tip. The front feet are broad, with strong, long claws (> 25 mm ), whereas the hindfeet have small claws ( 15 mm ). There are two pairs of mammae. The skull is massive, with short orbital processes and robust teeth. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,.P 3/3, M1/1 =32.","Honey Badgers are found in diverse habitats including deep forests, subtropical dry evergreen forests, tropical thorn forests, open Acacia, Combretum and Terminalia woodlands, open riparian woodland (dominated by Acacia albida), Tarai or marshes, floodplain grasslands (dominated by Vetivaria nigritana), bushveld, afro-alpine steppes, rocky hills and kopjes, Rhigozum scrub sandveld, savannah, dry swamps, waterless sandplains, coastal sandveld, and deserts. They tolerate habitats with a rainfall of over 2000 mm (annually) as well as arid areas with less than 100 mm annual rainfall. Honey Badgers are found from sea level up to 4050 m . On following pages: 3. Hog Badger ( Arctonyx collaris ); 4. Japanese Badger ( Meles anakuma); 5. Asian Badger ( Meles leucurus): 6. European Badger ( Meles meles).","The diet is mostly mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but also includes roots, berries, and fruit (such as ber Zizyphusjubata). Favorite foods are honey and the larvae of honeybees (Hymenoptera). However, their adaptation to burrowing, together with the abundance of subterranean animals found in six stomachs, suggests that honey is only a secondary food item. Consumption of honey may also be seasonal because it is more widely available in the drier months of the year. In October and November, Honey Badgers in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa , were found to eat mainly rodents, which occurred in 60% of scats and made up c. 30% of the volume of food. Ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks, Spring Hares (Pedetes capensis ), Meerkats, as well as domestic sheep and goats, were also eaten. They are strong diggers, and do not hesitate to dig after rodents or other prey hiding underground. Food items are detected mostly by smell or sound. Excess food may be cached in a den. When Honey Badgers eat, the food is held between the front claws while the forelegs rest on the ground. Beehives are opened by tearing away the wood of trees; honey combs are also scooped out from the cracks of rocks with the claws of the forefeet. Grubs are removed from the comb with their incisors. The clay capsules of estivating lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), cases of insect pupae, carapaces of turtles, or skins of animals are peeled away to expose the softer inner parts to be eaten. Honey Badgers dig large spiders out of holes 15-25 cm deep in the ground. Fish are caught with the claws at the edge of streams or from drying pans. They may raid campgrounds or dumpsters at night and are widely blamed for breaking into poultry houses and apiaries. The anecdotal relationship between the Honey Badger and a bird, the greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator), may be mythical. Although these two animals may occur together at the nests of bees, a complete observation of this supposed symbiotic relationship, from the initial attraction by a greater honeyguide of a Honey Badger, through guiding to a nest by the honeyguide, to the breaking open of the nest by the Honey Badger does not exist. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, although diurnal observations are numerous. Honey Badgers shelter in burrows, thick brush, caves, clumps of fallen bamboo, hollow trees, old ruins, rock shelters, dens excavated by themselves, or abandoned burrows. Hollow trees are entered from the top. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Honey Badgers are good swimmers and can chase turtles underwater. They can also climb trees. Daily movements average 10-30 km , with males covering longer distances than females. Female Honey Badgers forage in a relatively small area, covering c. 10 km /day. They zig-zag short distances from bush to bush, digging on average 10-2 holes/km. Males engage in long-distance foraging, covering c. 27 km /day; only c. 1-3 holes/km are dug. Mean straightline distance between dens from one day to the next is c¢. 2: 5 km for short-distance foragers and c. 10- 1 km for long-distance foragers. Males and females differ significantly in their rate of travel ( 3-8 km /h and 2-7 km /h, respectively), straight line (6- 2 km and 2.4 km ) and actual distance (13- 8 km and 7- 7 km ) moved during an active period, but do not differ in the percentage of their home range area traversed in a single day (3%). Honey Badgers are mostly solitary, but pairs may be seen and aggregations may occur at feeding sites. Occasionally, after foraging in a particular area for most of the night, a male may suddenly move off to a location less than 9 km away, where it may meet up with other adults. On one occasion in Zimbabwe , six animals met up; they showed no aggression but continuously uttered a wide range of grunts, hisses, squeaks, and whines while rolling in the sand, sniffing each other, and scent marking. Such gatherings may last more than 18 min, and the Honey Badgers may retreat to the same den during the day. Radio-telemetry in the southern Kalahari revealed that the mean home range size of adult males ( 541 km ?) wassignificantly larger than the mean home range size of adult females ( 126 km ?). While mean home range overlap in females was moderate (13%) and home range centres were regularly spaced, females did not appearto actively defend a territory and no direct interactions between females were observed. Scent marking appears to mediate spatial-temporal separation and females show a loosely territorial spacing pattern. In contrast, the home ranges of males encompassed the overlapping home ranges of up to 13 females .

Young males tended to have smaller home ranges ( 151 km ?*) than adult males and showed a spacing pattern more similar to adult females than adult males. Breeding. Mating occurs throughout the year and there appears to be no distinct breeding season. The gestation period is 50-70 days. Litter size is commonly one to two. Only the motherraises the young. The young are born blind and helpless inside a burrow. At two days of age, one captive Honey Badger weighed c. 0-23 kg and was hairless except for a few hairs on the face; the head and body length was 19- 7 cm , and the tail was 3-8 cm . It uttered squeaks and low guttural sounds during the first weeks, usually at feeding time; vocalization changed to deep, drawn-out, ominous growls at ten weeks. Within three months, the young have a fully developed adult pelage. The claws are fully formed on each foot at four weeks of age.

Head-body 73: 3-95 cm (males), 81.2-96 cm (females), tail 14.3-23 cm (males), 15.2-22.5 cm (females); weight 7.7-10.5 kg (males), 6.2-13.6 kg (females). The Honey Badger is a short, stocky animal, with strong limbs and a short tail. The upperparts, from the top of the head to the base of the tail, are gray to pale yellow or whitish, and contrast sharply with the dark brown or black of the underparts. Completely black individuals have been reported from some parts of Africa. The tail is black, with a gray or white tip. The front feet are broad, with strong, long claws (> 25 mm ), whereas the hindfeet have small claws ( 15 mm ). There are two pairs of mammae. The skull is massive, with short orbital processes and robust teeth. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,.P 3/3, M1/1 =32. Habitat. Honey Badgers are found in diverse habitats including deep forests, subtropical dry evergreen forests, tropical thorn forests, open Acacia, Combretum and Terminalia woodlands, open riparian woodland (dominated by Acacia albida), Tarai or marshes, floodplain grasslands (dominated by Vetivaria nigritana), bushveld, afro-alpine steppes, rocky hills and kopjes, Rhigozum scrub sandveld, savannah, dry swamps, waterless sandplains, coastal sandveld, and deserts. They tolerate habitats with a rainfall of over 2000 mm (annually) as well as arid areas with less than 100 mm annual rainfall. Honey Badgers are found from sea level up to 4050 m . On following pages: 3. Hog Badger ( Arctonyx collaris ); 4. Japanese Badger ( Meles anakuma); 5. Asian Badger ( Meles leucurus): 6. European Badger ( Meles meles). Food and Feeding. The diet is mostly mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but also includes roots, berries, and fruit (such as ber Zizyphusjubata). Favorite foods are honey and the larvae of honeybees (Hymenoptera). However, their adaptation to burrowing, together with the abundance of subterranean animals found in six stomachs, suggests that honey is only a secondary food item. Consumption of honey may also be seasonal because it is more widely available in the drier months of the year. In October and November, Honey Badgers in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa , were found to eat mainly rodents, which occurred in 60% of scats and made up c. 30% of the volume of food. Ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks, Spring Hares (Pedetes capensis ), Meerkats, as well as domestic sheep and goats, were also eaten. They are strong diggers, and do not hesitate to dig after rodents or other prey hiding underground. Food items are detected mostly by smell or sound. Excess food may be cached in a den. When Honey Badgers eat, the food is held between the front claws while the forelegs rest on the ground. Beehives are opened by tearing away the wood of trees; honey combs are also scooped out from the cracks of rocks with the claws of the forefeet. Grubs are removed from the comb with their incisors. The clay capsules of estivating lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), cases of insect pupae, carapaces of turtles, or skins of animals are peeled away to expose the softer inner parts to be eaten. Honey Badgers dig large spiders out of holes 15-25 cm deep in the ground. Fish are caught with the claws at the edge of streams or from drying pans. They may raid campgrounds or dumpsters at night and are widely blamed for breaking into poultry houses and apiaries. The anecdotal relationship between the Honey Badger and a bird, the greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator), may be mythical. Although these two animals may occur together at the nests of bees, a complete observation of this supposed symbiotic relationship, from the initial attraction by a greater honeyguide of a Honey Badger, through guiding to a nest by the honeyguide, to the breaking open of the nest by the Honey Badger does not exist. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, although diurnal observations are numerous. Honey Badgers shelter in burrows, thick brush, caves, clumps of fallen bamboo, hollow trees, old ruins, rock shelters, dens excavated by themselves, or abandoned burrows. Hollow trees are entered from the top. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Honey Badgers are good swimmers and can chase turtles underwater. They can also climb trees. Daily movements average 10-30 km , with males covering longer distances than females. Female Honey Badgers forage in a relatively small area, covering c. 10 km /day. They zig-zag short distances from bush to bush, digging on average 10-2 holes/km. Males engage in long-distance foraging, covering c. 27 km /day; only c. 1-3 holes/km are dug. Mean straightline distance between dens from one day to the next is c¢. 2: 5 km for short-distance foragers and c. 10- 1 km for long-distance foragers. Males and females differ significantly in their rate of travel ( 3-8 km /h and 2-7 km /h, respectively), straight line (6- 2 km and 2.4 km ) and actual distance (13- 8 km and 7- 7 km ) moved during an active period, but do not differ in the percentage of their home range area traversed in a single day (3%). Honey Badgers are mostly solitary, but pairs may be seen and aggregations may occur at feeding sites. Occasionally, after foraging in a particular area for most of the night, a male may suddenly move off to a location less than 9 km away, where it may meet up with other adults. On one occasion in Zimbabwe , six animals met up; they showed no aggression but continuously uttered a wide range of grunts, hisses, squeaks, and whines while rolling in the sand, sniffing each other, and scent marking. Such gatherings may last more than 18 min, and the Honey Badgers may retreat to the same den during the day. Radio-telemetry in the southern Kalahari revealed that the mean home range size of adult males ( 541 km ?) wassignificantly larger than the mean home range size of adult females ( 126 km ?). While mean home range overlap in females was moderate (13%) and home range centres were regularly spaced, females did not appearto actively defend a territory and no direct interactions between females were observed. Scent marking appears to mediate spatial-temporal separation and females show a loosely territorial spacing pattern. In contrast, the home ranges of males encompassed the overlapping home ranges of up to 13 females . Young males tended to have smaller home ranges ( 151 km ?*) than adult males and showed a spacing pattern more similar to adult females than adult males. Breeding. Mating occurs throughout the year and there appears to be no distinct breeding season. The gestation period is 50-70 days. Litter size is commonly one to two. Only the motherraises the young. The young are born blind and helpless inside a burrow. At two days of age, one captive Honey Badger weighed c. 0-23 kg and was hairless except for a few hairs on the face; the head and body length was 19- 7 cm , and the tail was 3-8 cm . It uttered squeaks and low guttural sounds during the first weeks, usually at feeding time; vocalization changed to deep, drawn-out, ominous growls at ten weeks. Within three months, the young have a fully developed adult pelage. The claws are fully formed on each foot at four weeks of age. The eyes open after 33 days and teeth begin erupting at 36 days and are fully developed at around three months. Adult size is reached after six months. Attempts at walking progress from a swimming motion (using all four legs) at age two to three weeks,to a forward dragging movement by the front legs at age five weeks, to a trot, similar to that of an adult, at eight weeks. Climbing starts at ten weeks. The young reach independence after 12-16 months. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Honey Badgers do not occur at high densities and are considered uncommon throughout their range. Persecution by beekeepers and livestock farmers is probably the greatest threat to this species.

The skull is wedge-shaped, almost triangular.","American Badgers are found in grasslands, prairie habitats, shrubs and steppes, and open woodlands. In British Columbia , they prefer open range and agricultural habitats that have fine sandy-loam and well-drained soils.","The diet includes small mammals (especially marmots, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, pocket gophers, cottontail rabbits, mice, voles, chipmunks, and squirrels), birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates (insects and molluscs). Carrion is also eaten. In British Columbia , the six main prey species are the Columbian Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus), Yellow-bellied Marmot (Marmota Slaviventris), Northern Pocket Gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), Southern Red-backed Vole (Myodes gapperi), and Meadow Vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). In south-eastern Wyoming , prairie dogs were found in 57% of stomach and fecal samples from female American Badgers. The most common food item in the diet in west-central Minnesota and south-eastern North Dakota is small mammals (98%, primarily Muridae and Geomyidae). Other prey includes insects (40%), and birds and eggs (32%, mostly ducks Anatidae ). Reptiles, amphibians and molluscs are also eaten, but are less common than other foods. Insects and birds’ eggs are more common in the diet during spring (April-May) than summer (June-July). Birds are more frequent in the diets of adults than juveniles. In South Dakota , 40% of stomach contents were mammals, 35% were of plant origin, 10% were birds, 10% were insects, and the remainder was mostly inorganic materials. American Badgers obtain most of their food by excavating the burrows of fossorial animals. If large prey is taken, such as a rabbit, the badger may dig a hole, carry in the prey, and remain below ground with it for several days. There are reports of American Badgers forming a “hunting partnership” with Coyotes. The Coyote apparently usesits keen sense of smell to locate burrowing rodents and the American Badger digs them up with its powerful claws. Both predators then share the proceeds. The techniques used by American Badgers when hunting Richardson’s Ground Squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) have been observed. They frequently hunted hibernating squirrels in the autumn, sometimes hunted infants in the spring, but rarely hunted active squirrels in the summer. They always captured hibernating and active squirrels underground, but sometimes intercepted fleeing squirrels aboveground. The most common hunting technique used was excavation of the burrow, but plugging of openings accounted for 5-23% of hunting actions. Plugging occurred predominantly in mid-June to late July, before most ground squirrels hibernated, and in late August to late October when juvenile males were active, but other squirrels were in hibernation. American Badgers usually used soil from around the tunnel opening or soil dragged 30-270 cm from a nearby mound to plug tunnels. Theykill ground squirrels with a single grasping bite directed dorsally or laterally to the thorax. The canines and third upper incisors generally only bruise the skin, without puncturing it, but cause extensive hemorrhaging in the thoracic cavity. Food items are sometimes buried and eaten later. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but can be active at any hour. American Badgers rest underground in burrows; these are either self-excavated or are modified burrows that were initially made by another animal. The burrow can be as long as 10 m and can extend 3 m below the surface. A bulky nest of grass is located in an enlarged chamber; the entrances are marked by mounds of earth. American Badgers are active all year, but during severe winter weather they may sleep in the den for several days or weeks. During this period of inactivity, heart rates are reduced by 50% and the body temperature decreases by 9 °C. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Daily movement may exceed 10 km and dispersal movements may be greater than 100 km . Mean home range size is up to 12- 3 km ? for males and up to 3-4 km ? for females. Home ranges overlap, but adults are solitary except during the breeding season. In Utah , mean home range size was 5-83 km ? the mean size of female home ranges ( 2-37 km ?) was less than half that of the males. In Idaho , mean home range size was 2-4 km ? for males and 1-6 km ? for females. In south-eastern Wyoming , the mean home range size of females ( 3-4 km ?) was smaller than that of males (12- 3 km ?); mean overlap was less for females than for males, and the mean home rangesize of males was larger during the breeding season than during the non-breeding season (breeding = 11- 1 km ?non-breeding = 5- 4 km ?). A radio-tracked female in Minnesota used an area of 752 ha during the summer. She had 50 dens within this area and was never found in the same den on two consecutive days. In the autumn, she shifted to an adjacent area of 52 ha and often reused dens. In the winter, she used a single den and traveled infrequently within an area of 2 ha.

The Japanese Badger has a stocky body, short legs, grayish pelage, and contrasting black and white stripes on the head and upper neck. The foreclaws are well-developed for digging; the hindclaws are much smaller.","Japanese Badgers are found in fields and forests, often in close proximity to humans in suburban habitats.","In Hinode, a suburb of Tokyo , scat analysis revealed that during spring and summer, earthworms (Megaseolocidae) occur at high frequency in the diet, with berries (Rubus sp.), beetles, and persimmon (Dymopyrus kaki) also eaten during summer months. Scavenged food is eaten in early spring when earthworm availability is low, and in the autumn, Japanese Badgers switch from eating worms when Persimmon is abundant. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, although sometimes active in the daytime. Breeding females, in particular, often forage during the day and in the spring. Between July and October, Japanese Badgers usually emerge from their setts around sunset and return around sunrise. After November, the time between emergence and return becomes shorter. From January to February, most activity ceases, and Japanese Badgers stay in their setts most of the time. The total hibernation period varies from 42-80 days, during which the body temperature is reduced. Den/resting sites are in underground burrows called setts or in couches. In Japan , the resting sites in each badger’s home range were found to be within 630 m of each other. Setts were sited within the core areas of home ranges and were mostly on a sub-ridge.

Japanese Badger Meles anakuma French: Blaireau du Japon / German: Japanischer Dachs / Spanish: Tejon japonés Taxonomy. Meles anakuma Temminck, 1844 . Japan . Some authors consider M. anakuma as a subspecies of the Asian Badger. Monotypic. Distribution. Japan (Honshu, Kyushu & Shikoku Is). Descriptive notes. Head-body 50-80 cm ,tail 14-20 cm ; weight 6-17 kg . The Japanese Badger has a stocky body, short legs, grayish pelage, and contrasting black and white stripes on the head and upper neck. The foreclaws are well-developed for digging; the hindclaws are much smaller. Habitat. Japanese Badgers are found in fields and forests, often in close proximity to humans in suburban habitats. Food and Feeding. In Hinode, a suburb of Tokyo , scat analysis revealed that during spring and summer, earthworms (Megaseolocidae) occur at high frequency in the diet, with berries (Rubus sp.), beetles, and persimmon (Dymopyrus kaki) also eaten during summer months. Scavenged food is eaten in early spring when earthworm availability is low, and in the autumn, Japanese Badgers switch from eating worms when Persimmon is abundant. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, although sometimes active in the daytime. Breeding females, in particular, often forage during the day and in the spring. Between July and October, Japanese Badgers usually emerge from their setts around sunset and return around sunrise. After November, the time between emergence and return becomes shorter.

The European Badger has a stocky body, with short legs and a short tail. The coarse and dense pelage is grayish, with black underparts and limbs. On each side of the face is a dark stripe that extends from the nose to the ear and encloses the eye; white stripes border the dark stripe. The tip of the ears is white.

Thefirst premolars are vestigial and sometimes absent.","European Badgers are mainly found in deciduous, mixed, and coniferous woodland, hedges, scrub, riverine habitat, agricultural land, grassland, steppes, and semi-deserts. They prefer densely forested areas adjacent to open fields, up to 1700 m . Occasionally, they are found in suburban areas. In central Spain , European Badgers prefer mid-elevation mountain areas, where both dehesas (open woods with pastures) and pine forests prevail; lower elevation areas are avoided. They are associated with watercourses and prefer trees and rock covered areas. In the Swiss Jura Mountains, European Badgers use forests and wooded pastures in the winter and spring and grain fields in the summer and autumn.","The diet includes earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and other invertebrates (such as insects and molluscs), small mammals (mice, rabbits, rats, voles, shrews, moles, hedgehogs), birds, reptiles, amphibians, carrion, nuts, acorns, berries, fruits, tubers, and mushrooms. In forests, European Badgers rely predominantly on earthworms (on average, 62% in diets). In farmlands and pastures, earthworms and plant material (usually garden fruit and cereals) play equally important roles (34% each). In England , the main foods are earthworms, insects, fruit, and wheat; grass is also ingested in substantial quantities. Earthworms are the most frequent food items, but wheat is almost as important in terms of percentage volume. In Poland , earthworms constitute 82-89% of the biomass consumed in spring. In summer and autumn, the proportion declines to 56% in pristine forest, and to 24% in a mosaic of forests, fields, and orchards. Supplementary food items during this time are amphibians (in forests) and garden fruits (in a rural landscape). In Denmark , earthworms, small mammals, cereals, and arthropods dominate the diet. In central Switzerland , the diet comprises 55% faunal material and 45% vegetal material. Earthworms have the highest frequency of occurrence. Voles, insects, and maize are eaten during most of the year, but never in large volumes, while wasps, cherries, plums, and oats are eaten seasonally and in large volumes. In Italy , earthworms and maize are the staple foods and together account for 57% of the mean estimated volume. Earthworm consumption varies seasonally, with a marked decrease in summer; this decline is compensated by a significant increase in fruits eaten. Maize is consumed all year round with no significant seasonal variation (from 21% in summer to 44-6% in winter). Prey items include amphibians (9%) and mammals (7-2%, primarily rodents and lagomorphs). In a dry Mediterranean coastal habitat in central Italy , European Badgers feed primarily on fruits and insects (90% ofthe total amount of food eaten each year). Other less important food items include myriapods, molluscs, birds, and mammals; earthworms do not play an important role in the diet in any period ofthe year. Activity patterns. European Badgers show crepuscular or nocturnal activity, generally starting after sunset and ending before sunrise, and are active on average for about eight hours per day. The highestlevel of activity is between 20:00 h and 03:00 h. During the day, they mainly rest in elaborate, communal burrow systems (setts) with numerous entrances, passages, and chambers, but other types of rest sites may be used. Setts may cover an area of 0-25 ha; they are used year after year and increase in complexity over time, and may eventually cover several hectares. There are two types of burrows: “main” setts (with many entrances) and small “outliers” (with usually only one entrance). Nests may be located 10 m from an entrance, 2-3 m below the surface, and have a diameter of 1- 5 m. Within a burrow system, European Badgers may utilize one nest for several months and then move to another part of the burrow. The living quarters are kept quite clean. Bedding material (dry grass, bracken, moss, or leaves) is dragged backwards into the den. Around setts, there are several dung pits, sunning grounds, and play areas. Well-defined paths, up to 2-3 km , extend from the sett to foraging areas. In south-western Spain ,setts are located almost everywhere, but European Badgers prefer easily dug, well-drained soils, with good vegetation cover within foraging habitats. They select sites with high surrounding shrub density, large shrubs covering the burrow, and close to the centre of the territory. During bouts of cold weather or deep snow, European Badgers may sleep in the sett for days or weeks. In northern Europe, this winter sleep may last several months. During this period, there is a substantial drop in body temperature and the badger lives off fat reserves accumulated in the summer and autumn. In south-west Portugal , main setts are the most frequently used restsites (62:3%); however, an average of 14 other resting sites are used in each territory. Females use more than twice as many occasional resting sites as do males. Generally burrows (predominantly main setts) are most frequently used during winter and autumn, whilst non-burrow shelters are preferred during spring and summer, when the weather is hot, dry and not windy. In northern Italy , ten setts (mean number of entrances = 2-1) were detected in the study area. Each radio-collared badger used 2-3 setts, occupying one sett from one to eight months before moving to another one. All badgers shared (although in different periods) one main sett located in the inner part of their ranges. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Mean daily movement ranges from 1-2 km in England to 7 km in Poland . Average speed of movement varies from 0-3 km /h in Spain to 1- 1 km /h in Switzerland . European Badgers in Britain form clans of mutli-male and multi-female groups, of up to 23 animals (average = six). Elsewhere in their range they commonly live alone, or in pairs with either intra- or inter-sexual territories. Clans are led by a dominant male and female, and usually have more females than males. Individuals move around alone within a clan range. These ranges are marked using latrine sites and secretions from the sub-caudal glands; sometimes fights may occur at territorial boundaries. In England , many clans have ranges of 50- 150 ha, with little overlap; the minimum distance between the main burrows of clans is 300 m . In the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland , the daily home range was 2- 1 km ? (19% oftheir total home rangesize). The size ofterritories varied from 8-4 to 25- 5 km ? (mean 12- 8 km ?). The mean individual home range was 9- 3 km ? and varied seasonally and among animals of different age and sex classes (from 4-24- 4 km ?). Home ranges of adult badgers were significantly larger than those of subadults. European Badgers occupied larger home ranges in summer, when earthworm availability was low. They moved with an average speed of 0-9 km /hour (maximum 7- 1 km /hour). Adults of both sexes visited territory boundaries significantly more often than subadult individuals. In Denmark , home range size varied between 2-96 km ? and 3-94 km ?; individuals from a social group had similar home ranges (95% overlap), whereas home ranges of individuals from neighboring social groups had little overlap (1-2%). In the Swiss Jura Mountains, radio-collared European Badgers travelled up to 9460 m each night; they avoided pastures and the vicinity of houses during their night trips. The average home range size was 320 ha, but the ranging behavior varied between seasons. Den-watching, night-lighting, and radio-tracking data suggested that European Badgerslive in pairs in this wet and cold region. In an area of agricultural lowland in northern Italy , radiotracked animals showed considerable home range overlap, with an overall mean size of 3-83 km ?.

Population density estimates range from 0-4 to 1-5 individuals per 100 ha. Breeding. Mating can occur year-round, but typically occurs in late winter to midsummer. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus can either be immediate or delayed for about ten months; the time of implantation seems to be controlled by light and temperature conditions. Embryonic developmentlasts six to eight weeks. The total gestation may thus be up to 9-12 months. Births occur mainly from February to March.Litter size is usually three or four, but can be as many as six. The young weigh 75 g at birth; their eyes open after one month. They nurse for 2:5 months and usually separate from the mother in the autumn. Both sexes reach sexual maturity after one year.","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. European Badgers are generally considered common and of no special conservation concern, although declines in numbers have occurred in some areas. They sometimes damage property or consume crops, and thus are often regarded as pests and persecuted. The hair is used to make various kinds of brushes, and badger skin has been used to make rugs. European Badgers are commonly killed on roads; as many as 50,000 may be killed each year in Great Britain . They are vectors of bovine tuberculosis, which has led to controversial efforts to reduce European Badger numbers in parts of Britain.","Balestrieri et al. (2004) | Elmeros et al.

European Badger Meles meles French: Blaireau d'Europe / German: Européischer Dachs / Spanish: Tején europeo Other common names: Eurasian Badger Taxonomy. Ursus meles Linnaeus, 1758 , Sweden . Up to twenty-three subspecies have been proposed, but a taxonomic revision is needed. Distribution. Europe, E up to Volga River, Russia ; also Caucasus and Middle East from Turkey , Israel , Lebanon , and Syria , to N Afghanistan . Descriptive notes. Head-body 56-90 cm , tail 11.5-20.2 cm ; weight 10-16 kg , adult males are larger than females. The European Badger has a stocky body, with short legs and a short tail. The coarse and dense pelage is grayish, with black underparts and limbs. On each side of the face is a dark stripe that extends from the nose to the ear and encloses the eye; white stripes border the dark stripe. The tip of the ears is white. The nose is long with a large rhinarium. All the feet have strong claws. There are three pairs of mammae. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 1/2 = 38. Thefirst premolars are vestigial and sometimes absent. Habitat. European Badgers are mainly found in deciduous, mixed, and coniferous woodland, hedges, scrub, riverine habitat, agricultural land, grassland, steppes, and semi-deserts. They prefer densely forested areas adjacent to open fields, up to 1700 m . Occasionally, they are found in suburban areas. In central Spain , European Badgers prefer mid-elevation mountain areas, where both dehesas (open woods with pastures) and pine forests prevail; lower elevation areas are avoided. They are associated with watercourses and prefer trees and rock covered areas. In the Swiss Jura Mountains, European Badgers use forests and wooded pastures in the winter and spring and grain fields in the summer and autumn. Food and Feeding. The diet includes earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and other invertebrates (such as insects and molluscs), small mammals (mice, rabbits, rats, voles, shrews, moles, hedgehogs), birds, reptiles, amphibians, carrion, nuts, acorns, berries, fruits, tubers, and mushrooms. In forests, European Badgers rely predominantly on earthworms (on average, 62% in diets). In farmlands and pastures, earthworms and plant material (usually garden fruit and cereals) play equally important roles (34% each). In England , the main foods are earthworms, insects, fruit, and wheat; grass is also ingested in substantial quantities. Earthworms are the most frequent food items, but wheat is almost as important in terms of percentage volume. In Poland , earthworms constitute 82-89% of the biomass consumed in spring. In summer and autumn, the proportion declines to 56% in pristine forest, and to 24% in a mosaic of forests, fields, and orchards. Supplementary food items during this time are amphibians (in forests) and garden fruits (in a rural landscape). In Denmark , earthworms, small mammals, cereals, and arthropods dominate the diet. In central Switzerland , the diet comprises 55% faunal material and 45% vegetal material. Earthworms have the highest frequency of occurrence. Voles, insects, and maize are eaten during most of the year, but never in large volumes, while wasps, cherries, plums, and oats are eaten seasonally and in large volumes. In Italy , earthworms and maize are the staple foods and together account for 57% of the mean estimated volume. Earthworm consumption varies seasonally, with a marked decrease in summer; this decline is compensated by a significant increase in fruits eaten. Maize is consumed all year round with no significant seasonal variation (from 21% in summer to 44-6% in winter). Prey items include amphibians (9%) and mammals (7-2%, primarily rodents and lagomorphs). In a dry Mediterranean coastal habitat in central Italy , European Badgers feed primarily on fruits and insects (90% ofthe total amount of food eaten each year). Other less important food items include myriapods, molluscs, birds, and mammals; earthworms do not play an important role in the diet in any period ofthe year. Activity patterns. European Badgers show crepuscular or nocturnal activity, generally starting after sunset and ending before sunrise, and are active on average for about eight hours per day. The highestlevel of activity is between 20:00 h and 03:00 h. During the day, they mainly rest in elaborate, communal burrow systems (setts) with numerous entrances, passages, and chambers, but other types of rest sites may be used. Setts may cover an area of 0-25 ha; they are used year after year and increase in complexity over time, and may eventually cover several hectares. There are two types of burrows: “main” setts (with many entrances) and small “outliers” (with usually only one entrance). Nests may be located 10 m from an entrance, 2-3 m below the surface, and have a diameter of 1- 5 m. Within a burrow system, European Badgers may utilize one nest for several months and then move to another part of the burrow. The living quarters are kept quite clean. Bedding material (dry grass, bracken, moss, or leaves) is dragged backwards into the den. Around setts, there are several dung pits, sunning grounds, and play areas. Well-defined paths, up to 2-3 km , extend from the sett to foraging areas. In south-western Spain ,setts are located almost everywhere, but European Badgers prefer easily dug, well-drained soils, with good vegetation cover within foraging habitats. They select sites with high surrounding shrub density, large shrubs covering the burrow, and close to the centre of the territory. During bouts of cold weather or deep snow, European Badgers may sleep in the sett for days or weeks. In northern Europe, this winter sleep may last several months. During this period, there is a substantial drop in body temperature and the badger lives off fat reserves accumulated in the summer and autumn. In south-west Portugal , main setts are the most frequently used restsites (62:3%); however, an average of 14 other resting sites are used in each territory. Females use more than twice as many occasional resting sites as do males. Generally burrows (predominantly main setts) are most frequently used during winter and autumn, whilst non-burrow shelters are preferred during spring and summer, when the weather is hot, dry and not windy. In northern Italy , ten setts (mean number of entrances = 2-1) were detected in the study area. Each radio-collared badger used 2-3 setts, occupying one sett from one to eight months before moving to another one. All badgers shared (although in different periods) one main sett located in the inner part of their ranges. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Mean daily movement ranges from 1-2 km in England to 7 km in Poland . Average speed of movement varies from 0-3 km /h in Spain to 1- 1 km /h in Switzerland . European Badgers in Britain form clans of mutli-male and multi-female groups, of up to 23 animals (average = six). Elsewhere in their range they commonly live alone, or in pairs with either intra- or inter-sexual territories. Clans are led by a dominant male and female, and usually have more females than males. Individuals move around alone within a clan range. These ranges are marked using latrine sites and secretions from the sub-caudal glands; sometimes fights may occur at territorial boundaries. In England , many clans have ranges of 50- 150 ha, with little overlap; the minimum distance between the main burrows of clans is 300 m . In the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland , the daily home range was 2- 1 km ? (19% oftheir total home rangesize). The size ofterritories varied from 8-4 to 25- 5 km ? (mean 12- 8 km ?). The mean individual home range was 9- 3 km ? and varied seasonally and among animals of different age and sex classes (from 4-24- 4 km ?). Home ranges of adult badgers were significantly larger than those of subadults. European Badgers occupied larger home ranges in summer, when earthworm availability was low. They moved with an average speed of 0-9 km /hour (maximum 7- 1 km /hour). Adults of both sexes visited territory boundaries significantly more often than subadult individuals. In Denmark , home range size varied between 2-96 km ? and 3-94 km ?; individuals from a social group had similar home ranges (95% overlap), whereas home ranges of individuals from neighboring social groups had little overlap (1-2%). In the Swiss Jura Mountains, radio-collared European Badgers travelled up to 9460 m each night; they avoided pastures and the vicinity of houses during their night trips. The average home range size was 320 ha, but the ranging behavior varied between seasons. Den-watching, night-lighting, and radio-tracking data suggested that European Badgerslive in pairs in this wet and cold region. In an area of agricultural lowland in northern Italy , radiotracked animals showed considerable home range overlap, with an overall mean size of 3-83 km ?. Population density estimates range from 0-4 to 1-5 individuals per 100 ha. Breeding. Mating can occur year-round, but typically occurs in late winter to midsummer. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus can either be immediate or delayed for about ten months; the time of implantation seems to be controlled by light and temperature conditions. Embryonic developmentlasts six to eight weeks. The total gestation may thus be up to 9-12 months. Births occur mainly from February to March.Litter size is usually three or four, but can be as many as six. The young weigh 75 g at birth; their eyes open after one month. They nurse for 2:5 months and usually separate from the mother in the autumn. Both sexes reach sexual maturity after one year. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. European Badgers are generally considered common and of no special conservation concern, although declines in numbers have occurred in some areas. They sometimes damage property or consume crops, and thus are often regarded as pests and persecuted. The hair is used to make various kinds of brushes, and badger skin has been used to make rugs. European Badgers are commonly killed on roads; as many as 50,000 may be killed each year in Great Britain . They are vectors of bovine tuberculosis, which has led to controversial efforts to reduce European Badger numbers in parts of Britain. Bibliography. Balestrieri et al. (2004), Elmeros et al.

They are inhabitants of remote northern areas where there are few humans. Wolverines make greater use of forested areas during winter, and greater use of tundra during summer. Altitudinal movements may also occur seasonally, with higher elevations being occupied during the summer and lower altitudes during the winter, probably because of snow accumulation and prey abundance. In central Idaho , USA , radiotracked Wolverines used higher elevations in summer versus winter, and they shifted use of cover types from whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in summer to lower elevation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziezii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) communities in winter. Wolverines also preferred northerly aspects, but avoided roads and ungulate winter range. In British Columbia , Canada , radio-telemetry revealed that Wolverines negatively responded to human disturbance within occupied habitat; males tended to avoid helicopter skiing areas. Habitat associations of females were more complex, but in the summer they avoided roads and recently logged areas. In the Columbia Mountains, where winter recreation is widespread, females prefer alpine and avalanche environments where Hoary Marmot (Marmota caligata) and Columbia Ground Squirrel prey are found in the summer. During the winter, females tend to avoid areas with helicopter and backcountry skiing, and prefer areas where Moose (Alces alces) can be found. On following pages: 9.

Marten ( Martes foina); 12. Nilgiri Marten ( Martes gwatkinsii ); 13.","The diet includes the carcasses of large ungulates, such as Moose and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). In many areas, Wolverines are dependent on the ability of larger predators, especially Gray Wolves, to provide kills. In coastal areas, they also feed on the carcasses of whales and seals that wash ashore. Wolverines also prey opportunistically on deer, sheep, small mammals (rodents such as Marmota and Myodes, lagomorphs, and ground squirrels), birds, and eggs. Berries, nuts and fungus are occasionally eaten. Within two study areas in British Columbia , scat analysis revealed a diet that varied regionally and seasonally: Moose, Reindeer, and Hoary Marmots were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) and North American Porcupine (Erithizon dorsata) were more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) and American Beaver (Castor canadensis ) were more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains. Reindeer, Hoary Marmots, and North American Porcupines were found in significantly higher frequencies in the diet of reproductive females. Predation on ungulates (such as Reindeer)is facilitated when there is deep snow. Wolverines kill larger prey by a bite at the neck or throat. Small rodents may be chased, pounced upon, or dug out of the ground. Excess food is cached for later use and is covered with earth or snow, or sometimes wedged in the forks of trees. In Alberta and British Columbia , cache sites were in stands of black spruce (Picea mariana) or mixed-wood of high complexity, dominated by conifers, and in which the trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) component consisted of mostly dead or dying trees. These sites offered relatively good visibility of the surrounding area; caches were never located in the very dense homogenous spruce stands. Cache sites were classified as “simple caches”, composed of a single feeding site and/or excavation, and “cache complexes”, involving one or more feeding “stations”, latrines, resting sites, and climbing trees that may have been used as avenues of escape from competitors or predators. The better used cache complexes were accessed by numerous well-used trails made by the Wolverines themselves. Caches contained the remains of Moose that were believed to have been killed by Wolves. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but occasionally active during the day. Rest sites may be a rough bed of grass or leaves in a cave or rock crevice, in a burrow made by another animal, or under a fallen tree. In Alberta and British Columbia , resting sites were located on top of the snow in relatively open locations that offered good visibility of the surroundings. Wolverines do not appear to be hindered by deep snow and are active year round. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Wolverines are solitary and mainly terrestrial, but are also strong swimmers and agile tree climbers. Their scavenging habits dictate covering long distances. Daily movements in excess of 30 km are common; males travel more widely than females. They are capable of reaching speeds of 45 km /h. In north-western Alaska , the home ranges of males were 488-917 km * and 53-232 km ? for females. In south-central Alaska , home ranges averaged 535 km ” for males and 105 km ? for females. In Yukon , home ranges were 209-269 km * for males and 76-269 km ? for females. The home range of each male overlaps three or four females . However, in Montana , there was extensive overlap between the ranges of both the same and opposite sexes, and no territorial defense was observed. Population densities vary from one animal per 50 km ? in Siberia to one per 500 km * in Scandinavia. North American densities vary from one per 65 km ? to one per 200 km .",,"Mainly nocturnal, but occasionally active during the day.

Wolverines exhibit a polygamous mating system, as some males produce offspring with more than one female in a single year. Females often reproduce with the same male in subsequent breeding years, but sometimes change their partner, possibly as a consequence of a change in the territory-holding male in the area. Females are monoestrous and apparently give birth about every two years. Mating occurs from May to August. Ovulation is induced; implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed until the following November to March. Births occur from January to April, after a total gestation period of 215-270 days. Maternal dens are located in alpine, subalpine, taiga, or tundra habitat; reports of dens in low elevation, densely forested habitats are rare. Dens in Alaska are usually long, complex snow tunnels with no associated trees or boulders. In Idaho , dens are associated with fallen trees or boulders. In both areas, all dens are covered with at least 1 m of snow. Litter size is one to five; usually two to four. The young weigh about 84 g at birth and are born fully furred, but with their eyes closed. Weaning occurs after seven to eight weeks, and adultsize is reached by November, when the young separate from the mother. Females raise the young alone. Sexual maturity is attained after two or three years.","Classified as Near Threatened in The IUCN Red Listt. Wolverines are harvested for their pelt; although their fur is not used widely in commerce it is valued for parkas. Fur trapping has contributed to a decline in numbers and distribution of the Wolverine. Wolverines are also intensely hunted because they are considered a nuisance animal: they follow traplines and devour trapped furbearers, they break into cabins and food caches, they allegedly prey on domestic reindeer, and they attack sheep. Protection and recovery measures are needed to restore populations acrossits previously known range.","Aubry et al. (2007) | Banci & Harestad (1988) | Copeland & Whitman (2003) | Copeland et al.

In many areas, Wolverines are dependent on the ability of larger predators, especially Gray Wolves, to provide kills. In coastal areas, they also feed on the carcasses of whales and seals that wash ashore. Wolverines also prey opportunistically on deer, sheep, small mammals (rodents such as Marmota and Myodes, lagomorphs, and ground squirrels), birds, and eggs. Berries, nuts and fungus are occasionally eaten. Within two study areas in British Columbia , scat analysis revealed a diet that varied regionally and seasonally: Moose, Reindeer, and Hoary Marmots were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) and North American Porcupine (Erithizon dorsata) were more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) and American Beaver (Castor canadensis ) were more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains. Reindeer, Hoary Marmots, and North American Porcupines were found in significantly higher frequencies in the diet of reproductive females. Predation on ungulates (such as Reindeer)is facilitated when there is deep snow. Wolverines kill larger prey by a bite at the neck or throat. Small rodents may be chased, pounced upon, or dug out of the ground. Excess food is cached for later use and is covered with earth or snow, or sometimes wedged in the forks of trees. In Alberta and British Columbia , cache sites were in stands of black spruce (Picea mariana) or mixed-wood of high complexity, dominated by conifers, and in which the trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) component consisted of mostly dead or dying trees. These sites offered relatively good visibility of the surrounding area; caches were never located in the very dense homogenous spruce stands. Cache sites were classified as “simple caches”, composed of a single feeding site and/or excavation, and “cache complexes”, involving one or more feeding “stations”, latrines, resting sites, and climbing trees that may have been used as avenues of escape from competitors or predators. The better used cache complexes were accessed by numerous well-used trails made by the Wolverines themselves. Caches contained the remains of Moose that were believed to have been killed by Wolves. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but occasionally active during the day. Rest sites may be a rough bed of grass or leaves in a cave or rock crevice, in a burrow made by another animal, or under a fallen tree. In Alberta and British Columbia , resting sites were located on top of the snow in relatively open locations that offered good visibility of the surroundings. Wolverines do not appear to be hindered by deep snow and are active year round. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Wolverines are solitary and mainly terrestrial, but are also strong swimmers and agile tree climbers. Their scavenging habits dictate covering long distances. Daily movements in excess of 30 km are common; males travel more widely than females. They are capable of reaching speeds of 45 km /h. In north-western Alaska , the home ranges of males were 488-917 km * and 53-232 km ? for females. In south-central Alaska , home ranges averaged 535 km ” for males and 105 km ? for females. In Yukon , home ranges were 209-269 km * for males and 76-269 km ? for females. The home range of each male overlaps three or four females . However, in Montana , there was extensive overlap between the ranges of both the same and opposite sexes, and no territorial defense was observed. Population densities vary from one animal per 50 km ? in Siberia to one per 500 km * in Scandinavia. North American densities vary from one per 65 km ? to one per 200 km . Breeding. Wolverines exhibit a polygamous mating system, as some males produce offspring with more than one female in a single year. Females often reproduce with the same male in subsequent breeding years, but sometimes change their partner, possibly as a consequence of a change in the territory-holding male in the area. Females are monoestrous and apparently give birth about every two years. Mating occurs from May to August. Ovulation is induced; implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed until the following November to March. Births occur from January to April, after a total gestation period of 215-270 days. Maternal dens are located in alpine, subalpine, taiga, or tundra habitat; reports of dens in low elevation, densely forested habitats are rare. Dens in Alaska are usually long, complex snow tunnels with no associated trees or boulders. In Idaho , dens are associated with fallen trees or boulders. In both areas, all dens are covered with at least 1 m of snow. Litter size is one to five; usually two to four. The young weigh about 84 g at birth and are born fully furred, but with their eyes closed. Weaning occurs after seven to eight weeks, and adultsize is reached by November, when the young separate from the mother. Females raise the young alone. Sexual maturity is attained after two or three years. Status and Conservation. Classified as Near Threatened in The IUCN Red Listt. Wolverines are harvested for their pelt; although their fur is not used widely in commerce it is valued for parkas. Fur trapping has contributed to a decline in numbers and distribution of the Wolverine. Wolverines are also intensely hunted because they are considered a nuisance animal: they follow traplines and devour trapped furbearers, they break into cabins and food caches, they allegedly prey on domestic reindeer, and they attack sheep. Protection and recovery measures are needed to restore populations acrossits previously known range. Bibliography. Aubry et al.

They sometimes occur in gardens, plantations, and in agricultural fields. Tayras may hunt in grasslands, although much of their time is spent in forested areas. In the Ilanos of Venezuela , Tayras are usually found along gallery forests; at night, they may cross extensive grasslands, presumably moving from one forest to another. In Veracruz , Mexico , Tayras generally are restricted to forested habitats. They are found in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil , in deciduous and scrub forest of the Pantanal in Paraguay and Bolivia , and in gallery and scrub forest and tall grass savannas in Argentina , Bolivia , and Paraguay . In Belize , no significant habitat preference was found for the Tayra.","The diet includes fruits, small vertebrates, insects, and carrion. In Venezuela , three species of vertebrate (Echimys semivillous, Rhipidomys sp., and Iguana iguana) and four species of fruit (Genipa americana, Zanthozylum culantrillo, Guazuma tomentosa, and Psychotria anceps) were recorded from 18 scats; both FE. semivillous and G. americana were found in 50% of the scats. In Belize , four species of small mammals were found in 31 scats: Didelphis marsupialis (9-6%), Oryzomys palustris (22-5%), Sigmodon hispidus (32:3%), and Rattus rattus (29-0%). In addition, 19-4% small birds, 58-0% arthropods, and 67-7% fruit were found. The primary fruit eaten was Calocarpum mammosum. Additional fruits consumed included Cecropia mexicana, Astrocaryum standleyanum, and Spondias mombin. Prey and other foods are detected primarily by smell, as its eyesight is relatively poor. Prey are captured after persistent chases; the Tayra does not stalk or ambush prey. Activity patterns. Primarily diurnal, with peaks of activity in the early morning and late afternoon. On occasion, some nocturnal activity may occur, especially near human habitations. Rest sites are in hollow trees or underground burrows. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Tayras spend a large proportion of their time foraging or resting in trees. They are normally solitary, but adult pairs and small groups, consisting of a female with her young, are sometimes seen. In the Ilanos of Venezuela , a female with two young maintained a home range of 2: 25 km * around a den until the pups were about three months old, after which her range expanded to almost 9 km *. Upon expansion of her home range and weaning of the young, the female used new dens daily that were an average of 867 m apart. In Belize , Tayras traveled an average of 6-89 km per day. A female had a home range of 16-03 km* over a 13-month period, one male had a home range of 24-44 km ” over a 10-month period, and another male had a home range of only 2-11 km ? over a 3-month period; the short duration of radio-tracking for the last animal may have accounted for the small size of the observed home range.

Breeding. In captivity, breeding activity of adult Tayras occurs during the day. However, on Barro Colorado Island, Panama , two males and one female may have engaged in nocturnal sexual behavior. Males appear ready to mate year round and can reproduce by 18 months of age. Female Tayras have their first estrus at about 22 months of age; the estrous cycle is c. 52 days in young females and c. 94 days in older females. Females enter estrus several times each year for periods of 3-20 days. Gestation lasts 63-67 days. Delayed implantation does not occur. Tayras give birth to one to three young, but two are most common. In the wild, males do not remain with females, who raise the young alone. The young are born blind, covered in fur, and weigh about 100 g . The ears open at 27-34 days and the eyes open at 35-47 days. Deciduous teeth begin emerging at day 36 and are completely erupted by day 99. Permanent teeth appear at day 115 and are completely emerged by day 224. The young consume solid food by day 70 and are weaned by day 100. Five stages of development have been defined. First is the infant stage, days 1-50, during which the young suckle and do not leave the den. During days 50-75, the fledgling stage, the young leave the den for short periods, and solid food is provided by the mother, in addition to milk. The weaning stage, days 75-100, includes exploratory excursions, with independent feeding on fruits and insects. During the transition stage, days 100-200, the birth den is abandoned, the young are weaned, and they begin to hunt with their mother and kill prey on their own. During dispersal, days 200-300, family bonds break down and the young go their separate ways. The young reach adult size at six months. When outside the den, the young and mother use a clicking call to maintain contact if they are not within sight of one another. Mothers are protective of their young and will carry them by the middle of the body when a threatis perceived. This protective behavior persists as the young grow and mothers may also carry or drag them back to the den by their necks or ears. Prey-catching ability develops slowly and is learned. When only three months old, the young will follow and bite rodents and small birds on the rump or limbs. Through experience, bite placement is improved, resulting in killing bites to the base of the skull. The mother will bring wounded prey to her young and release it for them to catch and kill.","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. The Tayra is considered common throughout most ofits range. However, the range of E. b. senex has been greatly reduced in Mexico because of the destruction of tropical forests and the spread of agriculture.

M. a. nesophila Osgood, 1901 — SW Alaska and W Canada (islands off British Columbia , and perhaps along nearby mainland).","Head-body 36-45 cm (males), 32-40 cm (females), tail 20-23 cm (males), 18-20 cm (females); weight 470-1250 g (males), 280-850 g (females), adult males are about 65% heavier than females. The American Marten has a long, slender body, with short limbs, bushy tail, and large rounded ears. The pelage ranges from light beige to dark brown, and often shows shades of orange. Many individuals have yellow to bright orange throat and upper chest patches. The head is pale gray and the legs and tail are almost black. The feet are fully furred, each digit has a strong claw. There are four pairs of mammae. The skull is long and narrow, with elongated auditory bullae. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,P4/4,M 1/2 = 38.","American Martens are found predominantly in mature conifer or coniferdominated mixed forests. Preferred habitats are mature old-growth spruce-fir communities, with greater than 30% canopy cover, a well-established understory of fallen logs and stumps, and lush shrub and forb vegetation. They avoid large open spaces such as clearcuttings, but may use riparian areas, meadows, forest edges, and rocky alpine areas above the timberline. In the coastal forests of California, American Martens select the largest available patches of old-growth, old-growth and late-mature, or serpentine habitat; dense, spatially extensive shrub cover is a key habitat element. In Alberta , during the winter, American Martens use young forests, and mature/old coniferous and deciduous stands, according to their availability. In the Selkirk and Purcell Mountains of south-west Canada , American Martens were detected in all habitats sampled including recently logged areas, regenerating stands, dry Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii) forest and subalpine parkland. They selected for greater crown closure and older stands at the finer resolution; no selection for forest structure was detected at the larger resolution except that American Martens selected against increased overstory heterogeneity. They preferred coniferous stands over deciduous-dominated stands and were more abundant in wetter than in dryer areas. In a clearcut boreal landscape in western Quebec , in which black spruce (Picea mariana) is the predominant forest type , American Martens avoid open regenerating stands composed mostly of recent clearcuts with sparse regeneration. They do not select coniferous stands, even those that are mature or overmature, but prefer deciduous and mixed stands, a large proportion of which has a dense coniferous shrub layer. Winter home ranges usually contain less than 30-35% open or closed regenerating stands and more than 40-50% uncut forest. In south-eastern Labrador, American Martens avoid areas with low productivity and low canopy cover (<20%), but show no selection for tree species composition or cover among more productive forests. In eastern Newfoundland, mature coniferous forest is the dominant cover type in most American Marten home ranges and is the only forest type used proportionately more than its availability by resident individuals. Otherforest types used in proportion to their availability include coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands; open areas and sites recently disturbed by fire are avoided at this scale. In northern Maine, in an area where trapping and timber harvesting had been excluded for more than 35 years, American Martens were found to use nearly all the available habitat, although during the summer, they preferred stands that had substantial mortality caused by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Mature, well-stocked coniferous forest was the least abundant forest type in the home ranges of both sexes, in both seasons, whereas mature, well-stocked deciduous forest was the most abundant.","The diet consists mostly of rodents and other small mammals, including voles, mice, chipmunks, squirrels (7amiasciurus and Glaucomys sp.), and lagomorphs, especially the Snowshoe Hare. Other food items include birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (insects, earthworms), fruits, and berries. In Newfoundland, Meadow Voles were the most prevalent food item found in scats (80% in summer and 47-5% in winter); Snowshoe Hares occurred in 28% of winter samples, and 16% other food types were found in scats during each season. In the mixed-conifer forests of southern Sierra Nevada , where the American Marten and Fisher are sympatric, the diet of Fishers appeared to include more remains of birds, lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens. However, the dietary overlap between these two species was high. The diets of both species were more diverse than previously reported in North America, perhaps due to the absence or rarity of large prey (Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada . American Martens hunt and find food by constant searching, sometimes in trees, and often tunnel under snow during winter to search for microtines. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, but can be active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs ortrees, in rock crevices, or in burrows. Large logs, large snags, and large, live spruce and fir trees are important characteristics for den sites in the central Rocky Mountains. Squirrels provide important denning structures as well as prey for American Martens. Movements, Home range and Social organization. American Martens are solitary and partly arboreal, but spend a considerable amount of time on the ground. They can also swim and dive well. The home ranges of males are 2-3 times larger than those of females: up to 45 km ” for males (overall average c. 9 km ?) and up to 28 km ? for females (overall average c. 3 km ?). The degree of overlap of home ranges varies, but generally male home ranges overlap those of several females, and individuals are intolerant of conspecifics of the same sex.

American Marten Martes americana French: Martre d’Amérique / German: Fichtenmarder / Spanish: Marta norteamericana Taxonomy. Mustela americanus Turton, 1806 , North America. The number of subspecies is debated and here we recognize eight. Subspecies and Distribution. M. a. americana Turton, 1806 — E Canada ( Ontario & Quebec ) anf NE USA . M. a. abietinoides Gray, 1865 — SW Canada (C British Columbia & SW Alberta ) and NW USA (N Montana & Idaho ). M. a. actuosa Osgood, 1900 — Alaska and NW Canada (N Alberta , N British Catan, Northwest Territories & Yukon ). M. a. atrata Bangs, 1897 — NE Canada ( Newfoundland and Labrador ). M. a. caurina Merriam, 1890 — W Canada (W British Columbia ) and USA (S Alaska & W Washington ). M. a. humboldtensis Grinnell & Dixon, 1926 — SW USA ( NW California ). M. a. kenaiensis Elliot, 1903 — Alaska (Kenai Peninsula). M. a. nesophila Osgood, 1901 — SW Alaska and W Canada (islands off British Columbia , and perhaps along nearby mainland). Descriptive notes. Head-body 36-45 cm (males), 32-40 cm (females), tail 20-23 cm (males), 18-20 cm (females); weight 470-1250 g (males), 280-850 g (females), adult males are about 65% heavier than females. The American Marten has a long, slender body, with short limbs, bushy tail, and large rounded ears. The pelage ranges from light beige to dark brown, and often shows shades of orange. Many individuals have yellow to bright orange throat and upper chest patches. The head is pale gray and the legs and tail are almost black. The feet are fully furred, each digit has a strong claw. There are four pairs of mammae. The skull is long and narrow, with elongated auditory bullae. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,P4/4,M 1/2 = 38. Habitat. American Martens are found predominantly in mature conifer or coniferdominated mixed forests. Preferred habitats are mature old-growth spruce-fir communities, with greater than 30% canopy cover, a well-established understory of fallen logs and stumps, and lush shrub and forb vegetation. They avoid large open spaces such as clearcuttings, but may use riparian areas, meadows, forest edges, and rocky alpine areas above the timberline. In the coastal forests of California, American Martens select the largest available patches of old-growth, old-growth and late-mature, or serpentine habitat; dense, spatially extensive shrub cover is a key habitat element. In Alberta , during the winter, American Martens use young forests, and mature/old coniferous and deciduous stands, according to their availability. In the Selkirk and Purcell Mountains of south-west Canada , American Martens were detected in all habitats sampled including recently logged areas, regenerating stands, dry Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii) forest and subalpine parkland. They selected for greater crown closure and older stands at the finer resolution; no selection for forest structure was detected at the larger resolution except that American Martens selected against increased overstory heterogeneity. They preferred coniferous stands over deciduous-dominated stands and were more abundant in wetter than in dryer areas. In a clearcut boreal landscape in western Quebec , in which black spruce (Picea mariana) is the predominant forest type , American Martens avoid open regenerating stands composed mostly of recent clearcuts with sparse regeneration. They do not select coniferous stands, even those that are mature or overmature, but prefer deciduous and mixed stands, a large proportion of which has a dense coniferous shrub layer. Winter home ranges usually contain less than 30-35% open or closed regenerating stands and more than 40-50% uncut forest. In south-eastern Labrador, American Martens avoid areas with low productivity and low canopy cover (<20%), but show no selection for tree species composition or cover among more productive forests. In eastern Newfoundland, mature coniferous forest is the dominant cover type in most American Marten home ranges and is the only forest type used proportionately more than its availability by resident individuals. Otherforest types used in proportion to their availability include coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands; open areas and sites recently disturbed by fire are avoided at this scale. In northern Maine, in an area where trapping and timber harvesting had been excluded for more than 35 years, American Martens were found to use nearly all the available habitat, although during the summer, they preferred stands that had substantial mortality caused by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Mature, well-stocked coniferous forest was the least abundant forest type in the home ranges of both sexes, in both seasons, whereas mature, well-stocked deciduous forest was the most abundant. Food and Feeding. The diet consists mostly of rodents and other small mammals, including voles, mice, chipmunks, squirrels (7amiasciurus and Glaucomys sp.), and lagomorphs, especially the Snowshoe Hare. Other food items include birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (insects, earthworms), fruits, and berries. In Newfoundland, Meadow Voles were the most prevalent food item found in scats (80% in summer and 47-5% in winter); Snowshoe Hares occurred in 28% of winter samples, and 16% other food types were found in scats during each season. In the mixed-conifer forests of southern Sierra Nevada , where the American Marten and Fisher are sympatric, the diet of Fishers appeared to include more remains of birds, lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens. However, the dietary overlap between these two species was high. The diets of both species were more diverse than previously reported in North America, perhaps due to the absence or rarity of large prey (Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada . American Martens hunt and find food by constant searching, sometimes in trees, and often tunnel under snow during winter to search for microtines. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, but can be active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs ortrees, in rock crevices, or in burrows. Large logs, large snags, and large, live spruce and fir trees are important characteristics for den sites in the central Rocky Mountains.

Descriptive notes. Head-body 45-65 cm , tail 37-45 cm ; weight 1.3-3 kg . The Yellowthroated Marten has a long, slender body and a long, dark tail; the tail is 60-70% of head and body length. The ears are large and round. The pelage varies geographically and with season. The top of the head and neck,the tail, the lower limbs, and parts of the back are dark brown to black; the rest of the body is pale brown. There are bright orange-yellow markings from the chin to the chest. There are two pairs of mammae. The skull is strong; the temporal ridges do not approach to form a sagittal crest. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 1/2 = 38. Males have larger canines than females. Habitat. Forests, including dry and hill evergreen, mixed and moist deciduous, and dry dipterocarp forest, at elevations of 200-3000 m . In Thailand , radio-collared Yellowthroated Martens generally used the different types of habitat in proportion to their availability; however, one male was observed to use open forest-grassland less than it was available. Activity patterns. Primarily diurnal; activity peaks occur during the morning (06:00- 08:00 h) and late afternoon (16:00-18:00 h). Reduced activity periods are scattered during the night (20:00-04:00 h) and are greater during lunar nights than other nights.

The European Pine Marten has a long body, short limbs, and a bushy tail about half of the head and body length. The pelage is yellowish-brown to dark brown, with a light yellow patch on the throat and chest. The underfur is dark on the sides (it is lighter in the Stone Marten). The rhinarium is black.

In Norway , they prefer spruce-dominated forests with large trees, and avoid clearcuts and open habitats. In north-east Belarus , the higher food abundance in woodlands on clay soil results in a higher population density and a more even distribution of European Pine Martens than in woodlands on sandy soil, where they mainly live in valley habitats.","The diet consists of small mammals (including mice, voles, and squirrels), birds, amphibians, invertebrates, honey, fruits, and berries. In western Scotland , European Pine Martens prey extensively on small mammals (particularly Field Voles Microtus agrestis) and birds. Invertebrates are also important dietary items, with a high intake of beetles (particularly Geotrupes sp.) from March to September. Predation on birds and the intake of earthwormsis highest during the winter;fruits (bramble and rowan berries) are also important in autumn and late winter. In the Scottish Highlands, the diet is very varied and includes small mammals, large mammal carrion, birds, insects, and fruits. Small mammals are consistently important, whereas large mammal carrion, fruits and insects, are seasonal; birds are eaten at all times of the year, but are not a major part of the diet. Although appearing to be opportunist feeders, European Pine Martens did have strong food preferences: of the small mammals eaten, 94% were Field Voles. Insect species were also selectively eaten. Beetles (Geotrupes stercorosus, Carabus sp., and Serica brunnea) and Hymenoptera (Vespula vulgaris and Bonibus spp.) were consumed in large numbers when encountered. The diet indicated that European Pine Martens foraged on the ground, in glade areas within the forest, around night-time. In northern boreal Finland , the analysis of 5677 scats revealed that the European Pine Marten is an opportunistic generalist;its most favored food being small rodents (especially Clethrionomys sp.). Snow cover decreased the consumption of Microtus sp., but not Clethrionomys sp. or the Wood Lemming (Myopus schisticolor). Other food items were: Eurasian Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), Mountain Hare (Lepus timidus), carcasses of Reindeer, eggs, birds, common frog (Rana temporaria), berries, and mushrooms. In north-east Belarus , the diet includes rodents, birds, fruits, and carrion. In woodlands on sandy soil, European Pine Martens specialize in feeding on carrion in the cold season and on berries in the warm season. In winter, Bank Vole densities and the biomass of carrion are crucial food factors. In central Poland , where the European Pine Marten and Stone Marten are sympatric, both species feed mainly on small rodents, birds, and fruits. Although there is a high overlap in the trophic niches of both species, European Pine Martens feed more frequently on rodents and birds and Stone Martens on fruits and insects. In north-west Spain , mammals constitute the main prey all year round (50% ingested biomass), followed by fruit (28-1%), birds (20-9%), insects (0-8%) and reptiles (0-2%). Small mammals are the major prey species (41:6% ingested biomass), mainly Apodemus sp. (19-1%). Mammals are the most consumed prey in spring (65:8%) and winter (79-5%). However, in summer and autumn, European Pine Martens feed mainly on rowanberries (Sorbus aucuparia) (summer: 49-7%, autumn: 59-9%), followed by mammals (summer: 27-2%, autumn: 30-9%). On the island of Minorca , a total of 28 different food items were identified in 723 scats. Small mammals were the most important food overall, constituting 34% of the volume. During March to April, small mammals were the principal food consumed (63% of volume), followed by birds (19%). From May to June, birds were the main food (40%), followed by small mammals. Plant material and insects were the most important foods from July to August, when they made up 68% ofthe diet. Excess food may be cached for later use. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal. On the island of Minorca , radio-collared European Pine Martens were primarily nocturnal, being active at night 53% of the time in autumn/winter and 59% in spring; daytime activity levels were 19% and 14%, respectively. In Poland , radio-telemetry revealed that 69% of the martens’ active time was during the night. The activity rhythms of European Pine Martens vary between sexes and seasons. In spring, male activity peaks at 20:00-00:00 h, whereas in summer and autumn/winter, activity is bimodal, peaking at 18:00-22:00 h and 02:00-04:00 h. Female activity in spring is more evenly distributed than that of males, but in summer their activity peaks at 20:00-00:00 h. In autumn/winter, females have a bimodal rhythm, with peaks at 18:00-20:00 h and 02:00-06:00 h. In breeding females, activity rhythms change in the course of pregnancy and nursing. On average, European Pine Martensstart their activity 73 min before sunset and finish 87 min after sunrise. Females became active earlier than males, but both sexes terminate their activity at the same time. On average, both sexes are active for around nine hours per day; they decrease their activity from 13 hours per day on warm days to 2-5 hours per day on cooler days. The number of activity bouts per day varies from one to six (mean 2:6); the activity bouts of males are significantly longer (4 hours, on average) than those of females (3 hours). In the cold season, the duration of short inactive bouts increases and inactivity lasts longer in females than in males. Den/restsites are in hollow trees or logs, under debris, or under snow. In Great Britain , most dens are associated with trees (44-3%), rocks (27-6%) and buildings (13-:8%); 69-6% of all dens are elevated, although only 9-8% are in elevated tree cavities, perhaps indicating a scarcity of arboreal cavities. Movements, Home range and Social organization. European Pine Martens are terrestrial, but are also good climbers and will spend considerable time in trees exploring hollows and cavities in search of prey. Nightly movements may be up to 20-30 km . European Pine Martens are mostly solitary. Average home rangesize is 23 km ? for males and 6- 5 km ? for females. There is little or no overlap between the ranges of individuals of the same sex, but male home ranges greatly overlap those of one or more females. Independent subadults are tolerated within the exclusive ranges of adults of the same sex. In Bialowieza National Park, Poland , the mean annual home range of males ( 2-58 km ?) was larger than that of females ( 1-41 km ?). Daily ranges averaged 49 ha in females and 54 ha in males and constituted 0-3% to 88% of annual home ranges. Seasonal home ranges also differed significantly between males and females. Both sexes held the smallest ranges in December to January; female ranges increased in April to May, whereas those of males increased in June to September when they were mating. There was very little home range overlap between neighboring males (mean 4-6%) or females (mean 6%). Year-round, neighboring individuals of the same sex neither avoided nor attracted each other and females attracted males only during the spring/ summer mating season. Daily movement distance averaged 5- 1 km and the mean speed was 0-6 km /h. With increasing temperature, European Pine Martens moved faster, covered longer distances, and used larger daily ranges. Mobility and home range use were affected by breeding activity. In spring, females rearing cubs had longer daily movement distances and moved faster than non-breeding females. In summer, males covered larger daily ranges during the mating period than outside it. On the island of Minorca , female home ranges were non-overlapping and averaged 0-47 km ? (range = 0-31- 0-66 km ®); two male home ranges were partially exclusive, measuring 4-92 km ? and 9-19 km ?*male home ranges averaged 16 times greater than those of females. In Poland , population densities ranged from 3-6 to 7-6 individuals per 10 km ?.",,"Mainly nocturnal.

Mating occurs in mid-summer, but because of delayed implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus, births do not take place until March or April of the following year. Total gestation is 230-275 days. During the breeding season, captive females exhibited one to four periods of sexual receptivity, which usually lasted one to four days and recurred at intervals of 6-17 days. Litter size is two to eight, usually three to five. In Great Britain , natal dens comprise buildings (44:3%), trees (22:8%), other man-made structures (17-1%), and rocks (14-:3%). At birth, the young weigh about 30 g . Their eyes open after 32-38 days, weaning occurs after six or seven weeks, and the young separate from the mother in the autumn.

Recent molecular studies have suggested that the Fisher should be placed in its own genus, Pekania . Three subspecies are recognized.","M. p. pennanti Exxleben, 1777 — E Canada and NE USA.

M. p. pacifica Rhoads, 1898 — W Canada (coastal British Columbia ) and W USA .","Head-body 55-65 cm (males), 45-556 cm (females); tail 30-50 cm (males), 30-40 cm (females); weight 3.5-5.5 kg (males), 2.2-5 kg (females), adult males are roughly twice the weight of females. The Fisher has a long body, short limbs, a bushy tail, and large feet with strong claws. It is the largest member of the genus Martes . The pelage is silvery-brown to black; the back of the neck and head are often grayish or silver. White markings on the throat and upper chest are common. The skull has a strong sagittal crest, which is particularly well- developed in older males. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,P4/4.","Fishers are found in dense forests with a closed canopy; they avoid open areas. In north-eastern Canada and United States , they also occur in fragmented, mixed woodlots interspersed with agricultural land. In California , mid-seral Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor) forest types compose the greatest proportion of Fisher home ranges in the Coastal Mountains; the greatest proportion of home ranges in the Sierra Nevadas are in the intermediate tree size class with dense canopy closure, and in mixed conifer forests. In south-central Maine , Fishers use a variety of forest types , especially during summer. During winter, they hunt intensively in dense patches of coniferous undergrowth (where Snowshoe Hare tracks are common) and use deciduous stands less than expected by availability.","The diet includes lagomorphs (especially the Snowshoe Hare), North American Porcupines, ungulate carrion, small mammals, birds, reptiles, invertebrates, and fruit. During the winter in British Columbia , 18 types of mammalian and avian prey were found in 256 stomachs. The most commonly occurring prey species were Snowshoe Hares, Red Squirrels, and Southern Red-backed Voles. The diet varied between sexes: female fishers consumed small prey more frequently than did males. In the mountains of California’s Sierra Nevada , where the Snowshoe Hare and North American Porcupine are absent, other mammals are the most frequent food item; however, reptiles (20-4%) and insects (55-7%) are major components of the diet, and at least six fungal species are also eaten. In the mixed-conifer forests of the southern Sierra Nevada , where Fishers and American Martens occur together, the diets of both species are more diverse than reported elsewhere in North America. Although the diet of Fishers includes more birds,lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens, the dietary overlap is high. The great diversity of the diet in these two species may be due to the absence or rarity of large prey (such as Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada compared to other areas. In south-eastern Manitoba , Fishers prey heavily on Snowshoe Hares (84:3% frequency occurrence). In Vermont , most of the diet is mammalian (72%), with avian prey (15%) and fruit (10%) of secondary importance. In south-central Maine , winter foods include apples, porcupines, hares, Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), Red Squirrels, Northern Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), mice (Peromyscus), voles (Clethrionomys gapperi and Microtus), and shrews (Sorex and Blarina). The fall and winter diet in West Virginia and Maryland includes ten mammal species, four bird species, one gastropod species, and two types of vegetation. White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is the most frequent dietary component. Medium-sized mammals such as Northern Raccoon and small mammals such as Peromyscus sp. are also major dietary components, although small mammals occur less frequently than reported elsewhere. Diet overlap between the sexes was found to be considerable and differences between the sexes in the occurrence of major food groups (small mammals, medium-sized mammals, large mammals, birds, and fruit) were not significant. Hunting strategies vary with prey type . Snowshoe Hares are caught after rapid zig-zagging chases. Fishers hunt porcupines by searching for their dens. The arboreal skills of Fishers enable them to chase porcupines down trees to the ground, where they kill them after lengthy attacks, during which the Fisher repeatedly bites the porcupine’s face (which is unprotected by quills). Activity patterns. Active during the day and night; most activity occurs shortly before sunrise and after sunset. Males and females show similar amounts of activity, and both sexes are active more frequently in summer than winter. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs or trees, brush piles, or in rock crevices. Fishers in California select restsites in forested areas that have dense canopies, large trees, and steep slopes. In the Coastal Mountains and Sierra Nevada in California , standing trees (live and dead) are the most common resting structures, with California black oak (Quercus kelloggit) and Douglas-fir the most frequent species in the Sierra and Coastal areas, respectively. Resting structures are within the largest diameter trees available, averaging 117- 3 cm for live conifers, 119- 8 cm for conifer snags, and 69 cm for hardwoods. Females use cavity structures more often than males, while males use platform structures significantly more than females. The diversity of types and sizes of rest structures used by males suggests that males are less selective than females. In the Sierra Nevada study area, where surface water is less common, Fishers prefer rest sites within 100 m of water. In a central hardwood forest, Fishers were found to rest in hardwood, softwood, and mixedwood forest types in proportion to their availability in the summer, but tended to avoid hardwood areas in winter. They used nests, cavities, and burrows in proportionto their availability in winter, but in the summer, Fishers preferred nests to cavities, and burrows were not used. Males tended to use larger cavity trees and mixed forest stands more often than females. During spring, summer, and fall in south-central Maine , Fishers prefer using rest sites in the branches of conifers, within coniferous stands. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Fishers are primarily terrestrial, but are also good tree climbers. They are capable of long movements in short time spans; individuals have been reported to move 90 km in three days, 45 km in two days, and 10-11 km in only a few hours. Usual daily movements are 1-5- 3 km . Movements of males are greatest during the spring breeding season; non-reproductive females move similar distances during all seasons. Adult Fishers are solitary outside of the breeding season. Mean home range sizes are up to 40 km * for males and up to 20 km * for females. There is little overlap between the ranges of individuals of the same sex, but there is extensive overlap between the ranges of opposite sexes. In the Coastal Mountains and Sierra Nevada in California , the mean home range size of males (39- 4 km ?) was significantly greater than that of females (9- 8 km ”); the home ranges of females were significantly greater in the Coastal area than in the Sierras. In eastern Ontario , the mean adult home range size was 4- 4 km ?, with up to 71% overlap of adjacent intrasexual home ranges. In Quebec , in an area where trapping had been prohibited for more than 20 years, mean home range size was 9- 2 km ” for adult males and 5- 4 km ?*for adult females. In south-central Maine , the home ranges of females were stable between seasons and years, but males moved extensively from February through April, and their ranges shifted between years. Home ranges averaged 30- 9 km ” for males (range = 10-6-78- 2 km ?) and 16- 3 km ? for females (range = 8-1-39- 1 km ?). The ranges of adults usually did not overlap with others of the same sex, except for males during spring. Fishers of both sexes shifted or enlarged their ranges to include areas left vacant when others of the same sex were removed. Population density in preferred habitat is one per 2:6-7- 5 km ? but in other areas it may be as low as one per 200 km *. The adult population density was calculated as 327/ 100 km * in eastern Ontario , 2.7/ 10 km ? in Quebec , and 1/2:8-10- 5 km ? (summer) and 1/8- 3-20 km * (winter) in south-central Maine .",,"Active during the day and night; most activity occurs shortly before sunrise and after sunset.

Mating occurs from March to May. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed and births occur from January to early April. Litter size is up to six, but averages two to three. Natal and maternal dens are located high up in hollow trees. The young weigh less than 50 g and are born with their eyes and ears closed. The eyes open around seven weeks, weaning begins after two to three months, and separation occurs in the fifth month. Females reach adult weight after six months and males after one year.","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Fishers are considered common throughout most of their range, particularly in Canada , but they may be threatened in the western USA . They are trapped for their fur. In the 19"" and early 20™ centuries, excessive fur trapping and habitat destruction through logging led to a decline in Fisher populations over most ofits range. Closed hunting seasons, protective regulations, and reintroductions were then initiated in many areas. The Fisher has made a comeback in parts of the eastern United States , but it is still vulnerable in the western states, where it seems to be dependent on old-growth forests.","Arthur & Krohn (1991) | Arthur et al.

In Hamura, Japanese Weasels eat rodents, fish, arthropods, and crustaceans throughout the year; seasonal changes in the diet are small. In Tachikawa, the main food items are rodents and fruits in winter and spring, and arthropods and crustaceans in summer and autumn. On Zamami Island, where Japanese Weasels were introduced in 1957 and 1958, they eat a wide variety of prey, mainly insects, followed by reptiles and small mammals. Activity patterns. Nocturnal. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary. Breeding. Mating occurs in late winter and births occur in the spring. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. The Japanese Weasel is considered common throughout its range. This species has been introduced to certain areas to control reptiles and rats. Very little is known about Japanese Weasels and field studies are needed to learn more about their natural history, ecology, and conservation status. Bibliography. Fujii et al. (1998), Keishi et al.

There is much geographic variation in size. The tail is only slightly longer than the length of the hindfoot, and is less than 35% of head and body length. The Least Weasel is the smallest species within the Carnivora . It has a long and slender body, with short limbs and tail. Except in certain southern parts ofits range, the Least Weasel changes color during the spring and autumn. In summer, the upperparts are brown and the underparts are white. In winter, the entire coat is white, but unlike other weasels that turn white during the winter, the Least Weasel does not posses a black-tipped tail. There are three to four pairs of mammae.

They are also found near human habitations.","The diet is mainly small rodents, but other small mammals (such as lagomorphs, moles, and squirrels), birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, salamanders, insects (mostly beetles), fish, worms, and carrion are also occasionally eaten.

In Europe and Russia , Microtus agrestris, M. arvalis, M. oeconomus, M. brandti, Arvicola terrestris, Clethrionomys glareolus, C. rutilus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Lemmus lemmus, and L. sibiricus are preyed upon. In North America, M. pennsylvanicus, M. ochrogastere, C. rutilus, C. gapperi, Peromyscus leucopus, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Sigmodon hispidus, Dicrostonyx rubricatus, D. hudsonicus, and L. sibiricus are eaten. In Great Britain , one study showed that the diet consists of 68% rodents (mainly Microtus agrestis), 25% lagomorphs, and 5% birds and birds’ eggs. The small size of Least Weasels enables them to pursue prey into their burrows, so much of their hunting is underground or under snow. Males readily shift to larger prey such as birds, lagomorphs, and Water Voles, while females continue to search for Field Voles. Thus, males generally take larger prey than females and spend less time hunting in tunnels. Least Weasels take five to ten meals per day. Excess food may be stored, especially in the winter; the cache site may be within the home burrow or near a kill. Killing behavior is innate. Least Weasels respond to movements of prey as a stimulus for attack. The killing bite is delivered at the nape of the neck and penetrates the base of the skull or throat area. Activity patterns. Active day and night. The high-energy requirements of Least Weasels mean that they have to be constantly active, so active and rest periods occur in rapid succession. However, the timing and extent of their daily activity is related to the activity patterns of their prey. Least Weasels may spend the whole winter under snow. Den/ rest sites are in prey burrows, in rock piles, or in other well-concealed sites.

The European Polecat is possibly the ancestor of the domestic Ferret M. p. furo. Up to twenty-two subspecies have been proposed, but a taxonomic revision is needed.","Most of Europe W of Urals, and Morocco .","Head-body 29.5-46 cm (males), 20.5-38.5 cm (females), tail 10-519 cm (males), 7-14 cm (females); weight 500-1710 g (males), 400-915 g (females), adult males are larger than females. The European Polecat has a long, slender body and short limbs. The pelage is dark brown to black, with paler, yellowish undersides. The areas between the eye and ear and around the mouth, are silvery white. There are up to five pairs of mammae. Dental formula: 3/3. CV /1.P5/3. M1/2=34.","The European Polecat is found in forests, meadows, abandoned fields, and agricultural areas, often in close proximity to water. They sometimes occur near humans, but avoid dense urban areas.","The diet consists of amphibians, small mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. In Switzerland , the diet of European Polecats is almost exclusively carnivorous, but somefruits are also eaten, mainly by juveniles. Anurans (frogs and toads; mainly Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) are the staple food. Other foods of importance are small mammals (mainly Muridae, but also Microtidae and Soricidae), carrion, and eggs. The anuran proportion of the diet is higher in summer than in winter and higher in the mountains than in the lowlands. In mountainous regions, anurans are also the most important food in winter. Juveniles eat more fruits and invertebrates and fewer mammals than adults. Sex-related differences in the importance of the main food categories have not been detected. In Denmark , the stomach contents of 47 European Polecats revealed that they preyed mostly on amphibians (87%) and mammals (34%), and only occasionally on birds (9%) and fish (6%). In Poland , the analysis of 222 scats revealed that anurans (mainly R . temporaria) comprised 70 to 98% of the biomass consumed and were found in 60 to 95% of scats. Forest rodents (Apodemus flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus) constituted from 1-29% of the biomass eaten. The consumption of rodents grew with decreasing winter temperature and increasing numbers of rodents. Snow-tracking of individual European Polecats has shown that in wet forests, they move in close proximity to watercourses to search for anurans, whereas in the drier forests, they hunt rodents, mainly by digging. European Polecats constantly move as they search for prey, exploring burrows, hollow logs,trees, tree cavities, rock crevices, and farm buildings. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but can be crepuscular and active during the day. In Luxembourg , radio-collared European Polecats were 62% active during the night. Males were more active than females, and activity increased from winter to summer. In central Italy , ten males and six females were monitored using radio-telemetry. Males exhibited a regular and constant nocturnal pattern in every season, preferring the time between 20:00-06:00 h; activity was lower at dawn and dusk, and scarce during daylight hours. Females were significantly diurnal and crepuscular, but individuals revealed a flexibility in their activity pattern, including arrhythmic patterns without apparent temporal organization. Den/rest sites include crevices, hollow logs, burrows made by other animals, and sometimes buildings. In Luxembourg , European Polecats were located in 53 different resting sites, during the day. Aboveground shelters were used more often than underground shelters. Piles of branches, barns and stables, garden sheds and rat dens, were the most used sites, without specific preference for any one type of shelter. However, buildings seem to be of prime importance during severe weather conditions. Movements, Home range and Social organization. European Polecats are solitary and terrestrial, but also capable of climbing. Daily movements average 1- 1 km . In some forest areas, home ranges are 100-150 ha. In Poland , European Polecats occupied stretches of 0-65 to 3-05 km along a stream. The home ranges of females were exclusive, but they could be completely overlapped by male home ranges. In Luxembourg , the home range size of European Polecats ranged from 42 to 428 ha, with an average of 181 ha. The mean home range size of males (246 ha) was significantly larger than that of females (84 ha). European Polecats concentrated 50% of their space use in only 15% of their home range, possibly indicating that suitable habitat was patchy. Average distance traveled per night by males was 3-6 times greater than that of females. Also, seasonal variation in movements was observed in males, but not in females.

European Polecat Mustela putorius French: Putois d'Europe / German: Waldiltis / Spanish: Turon europeo Taxonomy. Mustela putorius Linnaeus, 1758 , Sweden . The European Polecat is possibly the ancestor of the domestic Ferret M. p. furo. Up to twenty-two subspecies have been proposed, but a taxonomic revision is needed. Distribution. Most of Europe W of Urals, and Morocco . Descriptive notes. Head-body 29.5-46 cm (males), 20.5-38.5 cm (females), tail 10-519 cm (males), 7-14 cm (females); weight 500-1710 g (males), 400-915 g (females), adult males are larger than females. The European Polecat has a long, slender body and short limbs. The pelage is dark brown to black, with paler, yellowish undersides. The areas between the eye and ear and around the mouth, are silvery white. There are up to five pairs of mammae. Dental formula: 3/3. CV /1.P5/3. M1/2=34. Habitat. The European Polecat is found in forests, meadows, abandoned fields, and agricultural areas, often in close proximity to water. They sometimes occur near humans, but avoid dense urban areas. Food and Feeding. The diet consists of amphibians, small mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. In Switzerland , the diet of European Polecats is almost exclusively carnivorous, but somefruits are also eaten, mainly by juveniles. Anurans (frogs and toads; mainly Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) are the staple food. Other foods of importance are small mammals (mainly Muridae, but also Microtidae and Soricidae), carrion, and eggs. The anuran proportion of the diet is higher in summer than in winter and higher in the mountains than in the lowlands. In mountainous regions, anurans are also the most important food in winter. Juveniles eat more fruits and invertebrates and fewer mammals than adults. Sex-related differences in the importance of the main food categories have not been detected. In Denmark , the stomach contents of 47 European Polecats revealed that they preyed mostly on amphibians (87%) and mammals (34%), and only occasionally on birds (9%) and fish (6%). In Poland , the analysis of 222 scats revealed that anurans (mainly R . temporaria) comprised 70 to 98% of the biomass consumed and were found in 60 to 95% of scats. Forest rodents (Apodemus flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus) constituted from 1-29% of the biomass eaten. The consumption of rodents grew with decreasing winter temperature and increasing numbers of rodents. Snow-tracking of individual European Polecats has shown that in wet forests, they move in close proximity to watercourses to search for anurans, whereas in the drier forests, they hunt rodents, mainly by digging. European Polecats constantly move as they search for prey, exploring burrows, hollow logs,trees, tree cavities, rock crevices, and farm buildings. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but can be crepuscular and active during the day. In Luxembourg , radio-collared European Polecats were 62% active during the night. Males were more active than females, and activity increased from winter to summer. In central Italy , ten males and six females were monitored using radio-telemetry. Males exhibited a regular and constant nocturnal pattern in every season, preferring the time between 20:00-06:00 h; activity was lower at dawn and dusk, and scarce during daylight hours. Females were significantly diurnal and crepuscular, but individuals revealed a flexibility in their activity pattern, including arrhythmic patterns without apparent temporal organization. Den/rest sites include crevices, hollow logs, burrows made by other animals, and sometimes buildings. In Luxembourg , European Polecats were located in 53 different resting sites, during the day. Aboveground shelters were used more often than underground shelters. Piles of branches, barns and stables, garden sheds and rat dens, were the most used sites, without specific preference for any one type of shelter. However, buildings seem to be of prime importance during severe weather conditions. Movements, Home range and Social organization. European Polecats are solitary and terrestrial, but also capable of climbing. Daily movements average 1- 1 km . In some forest areas, home ranges are 100-150 ha. In Poland , European Polecats occupied stretches of 0-65 to 3-05 km along a stream. The home ranges of females were exclusive, but they could be completely overlapped by male home ranges. In Luxembourg , the home range size of European Polecats ranged from 42 to 428 ha, with an average of 181 ha. The mean home range size of males (246 ha) was significantly larger than that of females (84 ha). European Polecats concentrated 50% of their space use in only 15% of their home range, possibly indicating that suitable habitat was patchy. Average distance traveled per night by males was 3-6 times greater than that of females. Also, seasonal variation in movements was observed in males, but not in females.

Females have been found to prefer small streams, whereas males prefer large streams.","The diet includes small mammals,fish, birds, eggs, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, molluscs, insects, and earthworms. In much of North America, the American Mink is a major predator of Muskrats; fluctuations in Muskrat populations have a direct effect on American Mink abundance. In Eurasia, where the American Mink has been introduced, the staple food items on rivers and streamsare fish (average, 27%), mammals (30%), and amphibians (17%), whereas on lakes and ponds,it is predominantly birds (33%) and fish (28%). On the upper reaches of the Lovatriver, north-east Belarus , three out of ten American Mink were found to be small mammal specialists; 86-92% of their scats contained remains of small rodents (mostly the Water Vole and microtines), and small mammals constituted 83-88% of the food biomass consumed; the other seven were generalist predators. In western Poland , the diet of American Mink consists mainly of mammals, birds, and fish. In autumn-winter, mammals constitute up to 56%, fish up to 62%, and birds 4-16%, of the biomass consumed. In spring and summer, however, birds form 45-60% of the biomass eaten; the common coot (Fulica atra) is the most frequently consumed prey. Scat analysis in eastern Poland revealed that American Mink relied on three prey groups: fish (40% in spring-summer and 10% in autumnwinter), frogs (32% and 51%, respectively), and small mammals (21% and 36%). Of the available small mammal species, American Mink strongly selected the Root Vole (Microtus oeconomus). The cold season diet depended on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, American Mink fed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of a river increases and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forest), American Mink shift to preying on small mammals (up to 65% in the diet). The stomach contents of 211 individuals in Thy, Denmark , revealed that the diet was mostly mammals (55% occurrence), followed by amphibians (36%), birds (33%), and fish (30%). In Bornholm, Denmark , American Mink prey mostly on birds (50%), followed by mammals (42%), fish (25%) and amphibians (4%). In Italy , the diet is mainly fish, followed by small mammals and birds. American Mink spend most of their time hunting near water, but can also hunt underwater. In a coastal environment of Scotland , radio-tracked American Mink were found to forage selectively at low or mid-tide and within the core areas of their home range; they showed no preference for areas rich in prey when foraging at high tide and between core areas. They also avoided areas with freshwater streams and preferred foraging in the mid-tide zone. Prey on land are detected by sight or sound. Surplus food is sometimes cached. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but with frequent periods of daytime activity, especially in areas away from humans. Den/rest sites are in burrows, hollow logs, hollow trees, rock crevices, old buildings, or abandoned dwellings of Muskrats, American Beavers, or Woodchucks (Marmota sp.). Burrows may be about 3 m long and 1 m beneath the surface, and have one or more entrancesjust above the water level. On the northern Iberian Peninsula, radio-collared American Mink selected resting places within dense scrub,close to deep water. Both sexes also used underground dens, but during cold days females rested in buildings much more often than males. Active females used areas of dense scrub, and males used large scrub patches. Movements, Home range and Social organization. American Mink are good swimmers. They can dive to depths of 5-6 m and swim underwater for about 30 m . They are also agile climbers and occasionally forage in trees. Movements are either short foraging excursions or long travel movements between areas. Daily movements may reach up to 25 km , but usually are less than 5 km . American Mink are solitary outside of the breeding season. Females have home ranges of about 8-20 ha; the ranges of males are larger, sometimes up to 800 ha. Home ranges include 1-8-7- 5 km of shoreline for males and 1-4- 2 km for females. In the prairies, the average home range of males was 7- 7 km *. The home ranges of males overlap with those of females, but there is little overlap with other males.

As the size of a river increases and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forest), American Mink shift to preying on small mammals (up to 65% in the diet). The stomach contents of 211 individuals in Thy, Denmark , revealed that the diet was mostly mammals (55% occurrence), followed by amphibians (36%), birds (33%), and fish (30%). In Bornholm, Denmark , American Mink prey mostly on birds (50%), followed by mammals (42%), fish (25%) and amphibians (4%). In Italy , the diet is mainly fish, followed by small mammals and birds. American Mink spend most of their time hunting near water, but can also hunt underwater. In a coastal environment of Scotland , radio-tracked American Mink were found to forage selectively at low or mid-tide and within the core areas of their home range; they showed no preference for areas rich in prey when foraging at high tide and between core areas. They also avoided areas with freshwater streams and preferred foraging in the mid-tide zone. Prey on land are detected by sight or sound. Surplus food is sometimes cached. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, but with frequent periods of daytime activity, especially in areas away from humans. Den/rest sites are in burrows, hollow logs, hollow trees, rock crevices, old buildings, or abandoned dwellings of Muskrats, American Beavers, or Woodchucks (Marmota sp.). Burrows may be about 3 m long and 1 m beneath the surface, and have one or more entrancesjust above the water level. On the northern Iberian Peninsula, radio-collared American Mink selected resting places within dense scrub,close to deep water. Both sexes also used underground dens, but during cold days females rested in buildings much more often than males. Active females used areas of dense scrub, and males used large scrub patches. Movements, Home range and Social organization. American Mink are good swimmers. They can dive to depths of 5-6 m and swim underwater for about 30 m . They are also agile climbers and occasionally forage in trees. Movements are either short foraging excursions or long travel movements between areas. Daily movements may reach up to 25 km , but usually are less than 5 km . American Mink are solitary outside of the breeding season. Females have home ranges of about 8-20 ha; the ranges of males are larger, sometimes up to 800 ha. Home ranges include 1-8-7- 5 km of shoreline for males and 1-4- 2 km for females. In the prairies, the average home range of males was 7- 7 km *. The home ranges of males overlap with those of females, but there is little overlap with other males. Population densities of 1-8 per km? have been recorded. Breeding. Females are polyestrous but only have one litter per year. Mating occurs from February to April. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus undergoes a short and variable delay, and gestation may last from 39 to 78 days (average 51 days). Actual embryonic development takes 30-32 days. Births occur in April to June. Litter size ranges from two to ten, with an average offive. The young are born blind; their eyes open after five weeks and weaning occursat five to six weeks. They leave the nest and begin to hunt at seven to eight weeks, and separate from the mother in the autumn. Females reach adult weight at four months and sexual maturity at twelve months; males reach adult weight at 9-11 months and sexual maturity at 18 months. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. The American Mink is considered common throughoutits range. It is harvested in the wild forits fur, particularly in North America; however, most of the mink fur used in commerce is produced on farms and American Mink are intensively raised in captivity. Most of the conservation issues with this species relate to its introduction to countries outside its natural distribution and the impacts on native fauna. Major threats to American Mink are linked with water pollution. Bibliography. Aulerich & Ringer (1979), Aulerich et al. (1974), Bartoszewicz & Zalewski (2003), Birks & Linn (1982), Bonesi et al.

The earliest members of the genus Crocuta first appear in the fossil record of Africa in the early Pliocene, dated at roughly 3-7 million years ago. However, members of this genus soon dispersed out of Africa, and based on fossils from the period ofits greatest range expansion in the Pleistocene, the genus Crocuta occupied virtually all of Europe and Asia, as well as most of sub-Saharan Africa. When exactly modern C. crocuta arose is not entirely certain, but this species is clearly very recent. C. crocuta does not appear in the fossil record until sometime after 990,000 years ago, and probably substantially closer to the present, perhaps within the last 250,000 years. Modern Spotted Hyenas can be distinguished from members of the genus Crocuta found in the fossil record based on body size, limb length and stoutness, the length and shape of particular skull bones, and unique characteristics of the cheek teeth. In contrast to earlier members of the genus, including the Cave Hyenas of Europe and Asia (C. spelaea), modern Spotted Hyenas have a post-cranial skeleton that is modified for cursorial hunting. Currently only one subspeciesis recognized despite substantial variation in coloration and body mass throughout sub-Saharan Africa. For example, individuals from southern Africa are larger than those from eastern Africa. Monotypic.","Most of Africa S of the Sahara Desert, except in lowland tropical rainforests. Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated from many areas of southern Africa.","Largest of the four hyaenid species. Head-body 125-160 cm,tail 22-27 cm, height at shoulder 77.3-80. 7 cm ; weight 45-55 kg and up to 86 kg . Females approximately 10% larger than males, although size distributions for males and females overlap. Degree of sexual dimorphism in body size varies geographically, being most pronounced in southern Africa. Its general color is sandy, ginger, or dull gray to reddish-brown, with black or dark brown spots on the back, flanks, rump, and legs. Spots may turn brown and fade with age. The fur is shorter in this species than in the other extant hyaenids. The head is large, rounded and powerful, with a short and blunt muzzle. In contrast to the other extant hyaenids, all of which have pointed ears, Spotted Hyenas have ears with rounded tops. The tail ends in a black, bushy tip, with approximately 12 cm of hair extending beyond the end of the tail bone. Like the other hyaenids, the Spotted Hyena has a sloping back because the forelegs are longer than the hindlegs, and a well-developed anal gland used for scent marking. The mane in this speciesis more poorly developed than in other hyaenids. The feet have four toes. Females usually have only two teats. The Spotted Hyena has long been considered a hermaphrodite in many parts of Africa because the external genitalia of the female are very similar to those of the male. The female has a peniform clitoris that is only a few mm shorter than the male’s penis, and is fully erectile. The sexes can be distinguished by the shape of the penile glans: the male glans is pointed whereas that of the female is blunt. A single urogenital canal traverses the enlarged clitoris; through this canal the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. There is no external vaginal opening as the outer labiae are fused to form a structure that resembles the scrotal sac of the male. The female’s pseudoscrotum has a bi-lobed appearance; the testes of the adult male make the scrotal sac larger and give it more distinctly rounded bulges. Thus scientists who study these animals can distinguish males from females even when the animals are lying down.","Spotted Hyenas occupy an extraordinarily diverse array of habitats, including savanna, semi-desert, swamps, woodland, and montane forest up to 4000 m of elevation, but are absent in lowland tropical rainforests, in alpine areas at high elevation, and in extreme desert conditions. Although they require water for drinking, they are able to make do with very little water, and seldom require access to it. Even lactating females can survive without water for over one week. The highest population densities reported for this species occur on the prey-rich plains of Kenya and Tanzania , and surprisingly, in the forests of the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya . In these areas, densities of Spotted Hyenas exceed one animal per square kilometer.","The foraging behavior of Spotted Hyenas is remarkably flexible. Long believed to feed mainly on carrion, these animals are in fact efficient predators that kill 60% to 95% of their prey themselves. On average across populations in which the relative proportions of hunted and scavenged foods have been documented, two thirds of their diet is derived from kills they make themselves, and only one third from scavenged food items. In addition to being able to obtain food either by hunting or scavenging, Spotted Hyenas exhibit extraordinary plasticity with respect to their prey preferences. Spotted Hyenas have catholic tastes, they are extreme opportunists, and they are able to exploit a vast array of potential prey types , ranging from caterpillars to elephants; they may also occasionally consume some plant material. However, in most parts of Africa, Spotted Hyenas derive the large majority of their food intake from only a small subset of the prey species available to them locally. In most environments, they focus on the local mediumand large-sized ungulates, capture of which yields the greatest caloric return while demanding the least effort and the fewest risks. Thus, in eastern Africa, Spotted Hyenas prey most frequently on Blue Wildebeest, zebra, gazelles and Topi. In the arid parts of southern Africa, they prey most frequently on Gemsbok. In Kruger National Park, their most common prey is Impala, and in western Africa, common prey includes Red-fronted Gazelles and Hartebeest. Foraging behavior varies with the prey currently sought. Spotted Hyenas search for gazelle fawns by wandering upwind through open grassland in a zig-zag pattern. They may dig for crocodile eggs along large rivers, and snap flying termites out of the air with their jaws. When hunting, Spotted Hyenas modify their behavior to take advantage of the most abundant prey species, or the species thatis easiest to catch; these change seasonally in some localities with the migratory movements of particular ungulate species. Instead of using felid-like stealth as a primary hunting tactic, Spotted Hyenas rely on their extraordinary endurance for success in hunting. They can run at speeds of up to 55 km /h, but at slightly lower speeds, they can maintain a chase for several kilometres. If the antelope being chased becomes winded, and turns to defend itself with its horns, the Hyenas rush in and start tearing off pieces of the prey animal’s flesh. Like canids, Spotted Hyenas kill their prey by disembowelling and dismembering them rather than by using a particularkilling bite. Spotted Hyenas may hunt either solitarily or in groups; in the latter case group size varies with the type of prey sought. Mean hunting group sizes among Hyenas in Kenya are 1-2 for Topi, 1-7 for Impala, 2-08 for Thompson's Gazelle, 2-92 for Blue Wildebeest, and 9-1 for zebra. Thus only zebra hunts involve large groups of hunters, and most hunting parties contain only one or two Hyenas. Ungulates such as Topi and Blue Wildebeest weigh roughly three times as much as an adult Hyena, but solitary Hyenas routinely kill these antelope. Although hunting group size is often surprisingly small among Spotted Hyenas, the feeding groups formed by these animals are often very large once a prey animal has been killed. The noise produced by feeding Hyenas often draws members of the clan that were not involved in the hunt to the kill site. Feeding competition among the Hyenas present at a kill is usually very intense. In East Africa, often more than 30 Hyenas can be observed trying to feed from a single carcass. Because of this intense competition, each individual Hyena consumes as much food as possible in a very short period of time. A group of 20-30 hungry Hyenas can reduce an adult Blue Wildebeest to nothing more than a pile of rumen contents in only 13 minutes. It is estimated that an adult Spotted Hyena can consume a mass of food equal to 25%-30% ofits body weight, and individual Hyenas have been observed to ingest up to 18 kg of meat and bone in one hour. However,as a result of limited access to carcasses, average food intake ranges only from 1-5 to 3-8 kg per day. Spotted Hyenas sometimes engage in kleptoparasitism, which is the aggressive acquisition of a fresh carcass from other predators. They have been observed displacingjackals, Striped Hyenas, Leopards, Cheetahs, and African Wild Dogs from kills. However Spotted Hyenas most frequently compete for kills with Lions. Spotted Hyenas and Lions occur sympatrically in many areas of Africa, and in most of these habitats, bi-directional food stealing has been observed between these two species. Dominance relations between Spotted Hyenas and competing species are not absolute but depend on the numerical presence of both parties. For instance, Lions usually displace Spotted Hyenas at kills. However, if Hyena group size is large and the ratio of Spotted Hyenas to female and subadult Lions exceeds four to one, Hyenas are often able to displace Lions from kills unless a male Lion is present. A single Spotted Hyena can usually dominate a Cheetah, Leopard, Striped Hyena, Brown Hyena, any species ofjackal, or an African Wild Dog. Spotted Hyenas have been observed caching surplus food in thickets and under water in ponds. These animals are very comfortable in water; they often play in seasonal pools, and lie in shallow water or wet mud to keep cool on hot days. Compared to the other bone-cracking hyenas, Spotted Hyenas rarely carry food to their young at dens. This appears to be because the risk of having one’s food stolen, even by much smaller hyenas,is very high at dens, particularly for low-ranking individuals. Activity patterns. Spotted Hyenas are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular, although they may be active at midday when temperatures permit. Dens are typically modified holes dug by Aardvarks, although caves are used as den sites in some areas. Only cubslive in dens; adults sleep above ground, often in thickets, particularly when midday temperatures are high. Although Spotted Hyenas are active for roughly one third of each 24hour cycle, their activity is not continuous. Instead, activity occurs in bouts interspersed with periods of rest. Hyenas in Kenya that were followed for complete 24hour cycles spent 32% of their time active, but 53% of their active time occurred during hours of darkness. Movements, Home range and Social organization. On average, Spotted Hyenas in Kenya move 928 m per hour when active, and typically travel over 12 km during each 24hour period, with males moving more than females. In Serengeti, daily movements may be much greater than this, as resident hyenas often commute 30-40 km in orderto feed on migratory herbivores. Spotted Hyenas live in social groups, called clans, which contain from ten to eighty members. Large clans contain multiple matrilines of related females and their offspring, as well as a number of adult immigrant males that are generally unrelated to one another. Small clans may contain only a single matriline and a single breeding male. Clan size appears to be determined by abundance of local prey animals: where these are plentiful, as on the prey-rich plains of eastern Africa, clans are typically very large, but in desert areas of southern Africa, clans may be tiny. Clans are fission-fusion societies. That is, all clan members know each other individually, occupy a common territory, and rear their cubs together at a communal den, yet they also spend much of their time alone or in small sub-groups. Spotted Hyena clans bear little resemblance to canid packs or Lion prides, but they are remarkably similar in their size, structure, and complexity to the societies of cercopithecine primates. Like troops of baboons and macaques, Hyena clans typically contain individuals from multiple overlapping generations, and clans are structured by clear linear dominance hierarchies in which an individual’s rank determinesits priority of access to food and other resources. In contrast to the situation characteristic of other hyaenids and most other mammals, female Spotted Hyenas are socially dominant to all adult immigrant males. Rank relationships among female clan-mates are usually stable for periods of many years. Average relatedness among females from different matrilines within a clan is extremely low. Like most primates, Spotted Hyenas produce tiny litters at long intervals, and their offspring require an unusually long period of nutritional dependence on the mother. Young Hyenas typically nurse for well over a year, and because it takes them years to become proficient at hunting and feeding, their mothers continue to help them gain access to food at ungulate kills long after weaning. Similar to female baboons, the social status of a female Hyena is determined not by hersize or fighting ability, but by her mother’s social rank. Indeed, the acquisition of social rank during early development occurs in a pattern identical to that seen in many monkey species, a pattern called “maternal rank inheritance” by primatologists even though no literal inheritance occurs involving genetic transfer of status from mother to offspring. Instead, in both Hyenas and baboons, maternal rank “inheritance” involves a great deal of important social learning that occurs during a protractedjuvenile period. Young Hyenas initially direct their aggressive behaviors equally at higherand lower-ranking individuals. But this changes rapidly during the first year of life as cubs learn to direct aggression only at animals lower in rank than their own mother. When youngsters become involved in disputes with group-mates, the mother intervenes on their behalf against all individuals lower-ranking than herself. Interventions by high-ranking mothers are more frequent and more effective than those by lowranking females. In addition, like young baboons, Hyena cubs are often joined in fights by coalition partners who may be either kin or unrelated animals. Along with maternal interventions, coalition formation functions importantly in rank acquisition. Thus the mechanisms by which youngsters acquire their social ranks are virtually identical in Hyenas and old-world monkeys. Patterns of competition and cooperation among Spotted Hyenas are also remarkably like those found in baboons. Although Hyenas compete intensively for food, they also rely heavily on cooperative interactions with group-mates, particularly their close kin, to acquire and defend both their social rank and such key resources as food and territory. Young Spotted Hyenas of both sexes “inherit” the social rank of their motherearly in life, and retain their maternal rank as long as they remain in the natal clan. However, whereas females remain in their natal group throughouttheir lives, virtually all males disperse after puberty tojoin a new clan. When a male immigrates into a new group, he entersas the lowest-ranking Hyena in the dominance hierarchy; he behaves submissively to all Hyenas he encounters in the new territory, regardless of their size, fighting ability, or social rank. This results in a society in which adult females and their cubs are dominant to all adult male immigrants. A male Hyena loses his maternal social rank and its associated feeding privileges when he disperses. In their new clans, immigrant males sometimes invest a great deal of time and energy in developing amicable relationships with resident adult females, as males engaging in these amicable relationships may enjoy a high probability ofsiring cubs. Due to the female’s male-like genitalia, coercive sex is impossible, so female choice of mates is an important sexually selected force in this species. Mate choice by female Spotted Hyenas apparently drives males to disperse: females strongly prefer to mate with immigrants, and they appear to discriminate against adult natal males. Therefore, almost all offspring are sired by immigrant males. Immigrants queue for status within the male hierarchy of the new clan; the highest-ranking males are those that immigrated first into the clan. Malesrise in rank only when higherranking immigrants die or engage in secondary dispersal; roughly 40% of immigrants disperse again, although the potential benefits of secondary dispersal are unknown. Clan members defend group territories from neighboring Hyena groups. Territory size ranges from roughly 20 km ?® in East Africa to approximately 1500 km ? in the desert regions of southern Africa, and is negatively related to the density of available prey. Territorial behavior is exhibited by both sexes, although females engage in these activities more frequently than males. Intruders encountered within the territory are usually chased to the territory boundary. Border clashes with neighboring clans, called “clan wars”, are most commonly observed in habitats containing high densities of Hyenas, where intrusion pressure is most intense. Territorial behavioris rarely observed among Spotted Hyenas inhabiting the vast desert regions of southern Africa, where prey are sparse, clan size is small, intrusion pressure is low, and the home ranges of resident hyenas are enormous. In some parts of Africa, where densities of resident prey may be low but where migratory herbivores are available as prey, Spotted Hyenas are known to adopt patterns of space-use that differ strikingly from those seen in areas with year-round resident prey. Specifically, Spotted Hyenas may frequently commute long distances from their defended territory to herds of migratory prey. In the unusual “commuting system” exhibited by Spotted Hyenas in the Serengeti, individuals travel long distances north or south from their centrally-located clan territories in order to feed on migratory herbivores. Intruders are tolerated by territory residents when the intruders are merely passing through, although residents behave aggressively toward intruders found hunting or feeding. In Namibia , Spotted Hyenas defend territories that expand and contract in size seasonally, as migratory prey change locations. Territory boundaries are visited sporadically by multiple clan members performing border patrols, during which boundaries are marked by pasting. A strong-smelling, yellowish buttery secretion is deposited from the anal glands onto grass stalks during border patrols. Spotted Hyenas also commonly paste deep inside their territories, although the frequency with which this occurs is generally far less than in the other hyaenid species. The paste transmits information about an individual’s identity, sex, reproductive state, and clan membership. Young Hyenas engage in pasting behavior long before there is any paste in their anal sacs, suggesting that this behavior enables cubs to acquire group odors from sites where clan-mates had pasted earlier. Spotted Hyenas engage in ritualized greeting ceremonies in which two individuals stand parallel and face in opposite directions. Both individuals usually lift the hindleg nearest to the other and sniff or lick the anogenital region of the other. The unique aspect of their greetingsis the prominent role of the erect “penis” in animals of both sexes. This is used to signal submission. Greetings occur between hyenas of all ages and both sexes, although greetings between adult females and adult males are uncommon and restricted to high-ranking males. Cubs can erect their penis or clitoris and engage in greeting ceremonies as early as four weeks after birth. Spotted Hyenas recognize their group mates based on visual cues, odors, and individually distinctive vocalizations. These animals are well known fortheirrich vocal repertoire. They emit deep groansto call their cubs out of dens, high-pitched whines to beg for food or milk, and cattle-like lowing sounds to bring group-mates to a common state of high arousal. The sound most frequently heard during the night throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa is the long-distance vocalization of the Spotted Hyena, called a whoop. This loud call can be heard over several kilometers. Whoopsclearly serve a variety of functions. They can be rallying calls to gather scattered clan members together to defend territory boundaries, food resources, the communal den, or clan-mates in danger. Mothers whoop to locate their wandering cubs, and hungry cubs whoop to call their mothers so they can nurse. Spotted Hyenas sometimes whoop to recruit hunting partners. Whoops are also used as a form of individual display, particularly by males of high rank. Adult males whoop more frequently than females, and high-ranking males whoop more often than lower ranking males. Finally, Spotted Hyenas are well known for their laugh or giggle, which sounds much like maniacal human laughter. This vocalization is a signal of submission. A submissive individual giggles to signal to another Hyena thatit accepts a lower status.",,"Spotted Hyenas are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular, although they may be active at midday when temperatures permit. Dens are typically modified holes dug by Aardvarks, although caves are used as den sites in some areas. Only cubslive in dens; adults sleep above ground, often in thickets, particularly when midday temperatures are high.

Small clans may contain only a single matriline and a single breeding male. Clan size appears to be determined by abundance of local prey animals: where these are plentiful, as on the prey-rich plains of eastern Africa, clans are typically very large, but in desert areas of southern Africa, clans may be tiny. Clans are fission-fusion societies. That is, all clan members know each other individually, occupy a common territory, and rear their cubs together at a communal den, yet they also spend much of their time alone or in small sub-groups. Spotted Hyena clans bear little resemblance to canid packs or Lion prides, but they are remarkably similar in their size, structure, and complexity to the societies of cercopithecine primates. Like troops of baboons and macaques, Hyena clans typically contain individuals from multiple overlapping generations, and clans are structured by clear linear dominance hierarchies in which an individual’s rank determinesits priority of access to food and other resources. In contrast to the situation characteristic of other hyaenids and most other mammals, female Spotted Hyenas are socially dominant to all adult immigrant males. Rank relationships among female clan-mates are usually stable for periods of many years. Average relatedness among females from different matrilines within a clan is extremely low. Like most primates, Spotted Hyenas produce tiny litters at long intervals, and their offspring require an unusually long period of nutritional dependence on the mother. Young Hyenas typically nurse for well over a year, and because it takes them years to become proficient at hunting and feeding, their mothers continue to help them gain access to food at ungulate kills long after weaning. Similar to female baboons, the social status of a female Hyena is determined not by hersize or fighting ability, but by her mother’s social rank. Indeed, the acquisition of social rank during early development occurs in a pattern identical to that seen in many monkey species, a pattern called “maternal rank inheritance” by primatologists even though no literal inheritance occurs involving genetic transfer of status from mother to offspring. Instead, in both Hyenas and baboons, maternal rank “inheritance” involves a great deal of important social learning that occurs during a protractedjuvenile period. Young Hyenas initially direct their aggressive behaviors equally at higherand lower-ranking individuals. But this changes rapidly during the first year of life as cubs learn to direct aggression only at animals lower in rank than their own mother. When youngsters become involved in disputes with group-mates, the mother intervenes on their behalf against all individuals lower-ranking than herself. Interventions by high-ranking mothers are more frequent and more effective than those by lowranking females. In addition, like young baboons, Hyena cubs are often joined in fights by coalition partners who may be either kin or unrelated animals. Along with maternal interventions, coalition formation functions importantly in rank acquisition. Thus the mechanisms by which youngsters acquire their social ranks are virtually identical in Hyenas and old-world monkeys. Patterns of competition and cooperation among Spotted Hyenas are also remarkably like those found in baboons. Although Hyenas compete intensively for food, they also rely heavily on cooperative interactions with group-mates, particularly their close kin, to acquire and defend both their social rank and such key resources as food and territory. Young Spotted Hyenas of both sexes “inherit” the social rank of their motherearly in life, and retain their maternal rank as long as they remain in the natal clan. However, whereas females remain in their natal group throughouttheir lives, virtually all males disperse after puberty tojoin a new clan. When a male immigrates into a new group, he entersas the lowest-ranking Hyena in the dominance hierarchy; he behaves submissively to all Hyenas he encounters in the new territory, regardless of their size, fighting ability, or social rank. This results in a society in which adult females and their cubs are dominant to all adult male immigrants. A male Hyena loses his maternal social rank and its associated feeding privileges when he disperses. In their new clans, immigrant males sometimes invest a great deal of time and energy in developing amicable relationships with resident adult females, as males engaging in these amicable relationships may enjoy a high probability ofsiring cubs. Due to the female’s male-like genitalia, coercive sex is impossible, so female choice of mates is an important sexually selected force in this species. Mate choice by female Spotted Hyenas apparently drives males to disperse: females strongly prefer to mate with immigrants, and they appear to discriminate against adult natal males. Therefore, almost all offspring are sired by immigrant males. Immigrants queue for status within the male hierarchy of the new clan; the highest-ranking males are those that immigrated first into the clan. Malesrise in rank only when higherranking immigrants die or engage in secondary dispersal; roughly 40% of immigrants disperse again, although the potential benefits of secondary dispersal are unknown. Clan members defend group territories from neighboring Hyena groups. Territory size ranges from roughly 20 km ?® in East Africa to approximately 1500 km ? in the desert regions of southern Africa, and is negatively related to the density of available prey. Territorial behavior is exhibited by both sexes, although females engage in these activities more frequently than males. Intruders encountered within the territory are usually chased to the territory boundary. Border clashes with neighboring clans, called “clan wars”, are most commonly observed in habitats containing high densities of Hyenas, where intrusion pressure is most intense. Territorial behavioris rarely observed among Spotted Hyenas inhabiting the vast desert regions of southern Africa, where prey are sparse, clan size is small, intrusion pressure is low, and the home ranges of resident hyenas are enormous. In some parts of Africa, where densities of resident prey may be low but where migratory herbivores are available as prey, Spotted Hyenas are known to adopt patterns of space-use that differ strikingly from those seen in areas with year-round resident prey. Specifically, Spotted Hyenas may frequently commute long distances from their defended territory to herds of migratory prey. In the unusual “commuting system” exhibited by Spotted Hyenas in the Serengeti, individuals travel long distances north or south from their centrally-located clan territories in order to feed on migratory herbivores. Intruders are tolerated by territory residents when the intruders are merely passing through, although residents behave aggressively toward intruders found hunting or feeding. In Namibia , Spotted Hyenas defend territories that expand and contract in size seasonally, as migratory prey change locations. Territory boundaries are visited sporadically by multiple clan members performing border patrols, during which boundaries are marked by pasting. A strong-smelling, yellowish buttery secretion is deposited from the anal glands onto grass stalks during border patrols. Spotted Hyenas also commonly paste deep inside their territories, although the frequency with which this occurs is generally far less than in the other hyaenid species. The paste transmits information about an individual’s identity, sex, reproductive state, and clan membership. Young Hyenas engage in pasting behavior long before there is any paste in their anal sacs, suggesting that this behavior enables cubs to acquire group odors from sites where clan-mates had pasted earlier. Spotted Hyenas engage in ritualized greeting ceremonies in which two individuals stand parallel and face in opposite directions. Both individuals usually lift the hindleg nearest to the other and sniff or lick the anogenital region of the other. The unique aspect of their greetingsis the prominent role of the erect “penis” in animals of both sexes. This is used to signal submission. Greetings occur between hyenas of all ages and both sexes, although greetings between adult females and adult males are uncommon and restricted to high-ranking males. Cubs can erect their penis or clitoris and engage in greeting ceremonies as early as four weeks after birth. Spotted Hyenas recognize their group mates based on visual cues, odors, and individually distinctive vocalizations. These animals are well known fortheirrich vocal repertoire. They emit deep groansto call their cubs out of dens, high-pitched whines to beg for food or milk, and cattle-like lowing sounds to bring group-mates to a common state of high arousal. The sound most frequently heard during the night throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa is the long-distance vocalization of the Spotted Hyena, called a whoop. This loud call can be heard over several kilometers. Whoopsclearly serve a variety of functions. They can be rallying calls to gather scattered clan members together to defend territory boundaries, food resources, the communal den, or clan-mates in danger. Mothers whoop to locate their wandering cubs, and hungry cubs whoop to call their mothers so they can nurse. Spotted Hyenas sometimes whoop to recruit hunting partners. Whoops are also used as a form of individual display, particularly by males of high rank. Adult males whoop more frequently than females, and high-ranking males whoop more often than lower ranking males. Finally, Spotted Hyenas are well known for their laugh or giggle, which sounds much like maniacal human laughter. This vocalization is a signal of submission. A submissive individual giggles to signal to another Hyena thatit accepts a lower status. Breeding. Females bear young throughout the year in most parts of Africa, although there are distinct birth peaks and troughs in some populations. Both sexes mate promiscuously with multiple partners. Courtship by male Spotted Hyenas is unusual among mammals because it appears to reflect such extreme conflicting desires to approach the female and also to flee from her. Males often engage in approach-avoid and bowing displays, both of which appear to reflect strong motivational conflict and hesitancy on the part of the male. Their behavior suggests that interactions with females may be unusually risky for males in this species, and that males fear females. In general, the female seems to take little notice of the male hyena’s sexual advances. Estrus lasts 1-3 days, but the length of the female's cycle, and whether ovulation is spontaneous or induced, are not known. Copulation involves multiple mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations. Female receptivity is indicated by inhibited aggression toward the male and by assumption of a distinctive receptive stance in which the female lowers her head and keeps her mouth near the ground. The only behavior indicative of a female's interest in mating is that she may follow a male. Some males who sire cubs form consortships with females, but others do not, suggesting that individual male Hyenas may adopt multiple alternative reproductive tactics to attract and acquire mates. That is, male Hyenas may sometimes “shadow” or “guard” their mates, but intensive mate-guarding is not required to ensure that a male will sire the cubs of a particular female. Females have been observed mating with one to four males within a single estrous period, and multiple paternity has been documented to occur in 25-30% of twin litters. Many copulations among Crocuta appear to be infertile. Female Spotted Hyenas are exposed to high concentrations of androgens in utero, and this early androgen exposure may have negative effects on female fertility by altering ovarian histology or other mechanisms. It has recently been determined that early androgen exposure is not necessary for formation of the female's peniform clitoris. Females give birth through their penis-like clitoris. During parturition, the clitoris tears to permit the passage of the young, creating a large bleeding wound on the posterior surface that may take weeks to heal. Females usually produce litters of two, although singletons are also common, and triplets are observed occasionally. Cubs weigh roughly 1 kg at birth. They are born with their eyes open, their deciduous canine and incisor teeth fully erupted, and they are capable of remarkably coordinated movement immediately after birth. They are thus relatively precocial compared to cubs in other hyaenid species or in most other carnivores. Their coats are pure black at birth; cubs start to molt at 5-6 weeks of age, and the natal coat is completely replaced by an adult-colored, spotted pelage by 4-5 months of age. The spots never change except to fade a bit with age. Cubs are usually born in an isolated natal den and are transferred to the clan’s communal den when they are 2-5 weeks old. They remain at the communal den until they are 8-12 months old, and then begin traveling around the clan’s territory, initially with their mothers and later alone. As in the other bone-cracking hyenas, weaning occurs surprisingly late, usually around 13-14 months of age, but twin litters borne by low-ranking females may be nursed as long as two years. Fifty percent of cubs die before puberty, and mortality rates are generally highest immediately after weaning. Males reach reproductive maturity at around two years of age, and most females start bearing young in their third or fourth year. However, age at first parturition varies between two and six years. All females in a clan reproduce, and females rear their young together in the communal den. Therefore occupied dens may contain up to 30 young of different ages from up to 20 litters. Females nurse only their own cubs and usually reject approaches by other cubs. The milk of Spotted Hyenas has the highest protein content (mean 14-9%) recorded for any terrestrial carnivore, a fat content (mean 141%) exceeded only by that of palaearctic bears and the sea otter, and a higher gross energy density than the milk of most other terrestrial carnivores. Due to the high energy content of their milk, and the long nursing period, Spotted Hyenas have the highest energetic investment per litter of any carnivore. Reproductive success in both sexes is related to dominancestatus, although this relationship is stronger among females than males. High-ranking females enjoy greater reproductive success than low-ranking females because they have longer reproductive life spans and shorter inter-birth intervals, and because their cubs experience lower mortality than do cubs of low-ranking females. Sex ratios among adults are usually slightly female-biased. Reproductive success among males varies with intra-sexual rank, although alpha males fare more poorly than would be expected based on social status alone. As most males disperse from their natal clan when they are at least two years old, most breeding males are immigrants. Spotted Hyenas are sometimes referred to as the “Cain and Abel” of the animal world because of the common belief that they routinely kill their siblings shortly after birth. Although littermates do engage in aggressive interactions within minutes after birth, and although this can result in obvious scarring of the subordinate littermate, these aggressive interactions seldom result in the death of a sibling. These early fights quickly lead to the establishment of a dominance relationship that allows the dominant cub to control access to the mother’s milk. Siblicide in the Spotted Hyena is facultative in that it occurs only in some twin litters rather than routinely. The purpose of the early fighting is to establish an unambiguous dominance relationship within the litter. It appears that the relative costs and benefits of killing one’s sibling vary with current socio-ecological conditions: a cub that killsits sibling may obtain significant benefits if its mother is unable to support multiple cubs. However, mothers can usually support two cubs in many parts of Africa without undue difficulty.","Listed as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The total world population of the Spotted Hyena is well above 10,000 individuals, several subpopulations exceed 1000 individuals and its range well exceeds 20,000 km ®. The rapid decline of populations outside conservation areas due to persecution and habitat loss makes the species increasingly dependent on the continued existence of protected areas. Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated in Algeria and Lesotho , and they are listed as threatened in Benin , Burundi , Cameroon , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , Rwanda , and Sierra Leone . The largest remaining populations are found in Kenya , Tanzania , South Africa , and Namibia . Most adult mortality is caused directly by lions and humans,although disease is an important mortality source in some areas. Human-caused mortality is common even inside protected areas. Spotted Hyenas may attack livestock, particularly where natural prey are usually or seasonally sparse. Often in response to confirmed or assumed livestock depredation, Spotted Hyenas are shot, snared, speared, or poisoned in many parts of their range by ranchers and pastoralists. Spotted Hyenas are also commonly killed on motor-ways. Habitat fragmentation and reduction are also having significant negative effects on the size of many Spotted Hyena populations. Finally, one of the most important threats to the conservation of Spotted Hyenas is their negative public image. Many people apparently believe these animals are not worth conserving. Educating the public about these complex and fascinating animals is expected to have a substantial positive effect on conservation efforts.","Bearder (1977) | Bearder & Randall (1978) | Binder & Van Valkenburgh (2000) | Binford et al.

Spotted Hyena Crocuta crocuta French: Hyene tachetée / German: TlUpfelhyane / Spanish: Hiena manchada Taxonomy. Canis crocuta Erxleben, 1777 , Guinea , Aethiopia; restricted to “Senegambia”. The earliest members of the genus Crocuta first appear in the fossil record of Africa in the early Pliocene, dated at roughly 3-7 million years ago. However, members of this genus soon dispersed out of Africa, and based on fossils from the period ofits greatest range expansion in the Pleistocene, the genus Crocuta occupied virtually all of Europe and Asia, as well as most of sub-Saharan Africa. When exactly modern C. crocuta arose is not entirely certain, but this species is clearly very recent. C. crocuta does not appear in the fossil record until sometime after 990,000 years ago, and probably substantially closer to the present, perhaps within the last 250,000 years. Modern Spotted Hyenas can be distinguished from members of the genus Crocuta found in the fossil record based on body size, limb length and stoutness, the length and shape of particular skull bones, and unique characteristics of the cheek teeth. In contrast to earlier members of the genus, including the Cave Hyenas of Europe and Asia (C. spelaea), modern Spotted Hyenas have a post-cranial skeleton that is modified for cursorial hunting. Currently only one subspeciesis recognized despite substantial variation in coloration and body mass throughout sub-Saharan Africa. For example, individuals from southern Africa are larger than those from eastern Africa. Monotypic. Distribution. Most of Africa S of the Sahara Desert, except in lowland tropical rainforests. Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated from many areas of southern Africa. Descriptive notes. Largest of the four hyaenid species. Head-body 125-160 cm,tail 22-27 cm, height at shoulder 77.3-80. 7 cm ; weight 45-55 kg and up to 86 kg . Females approximately 10% larger than males, although size distributions for males and females overlap. Degree of sexual dimorphism in body size varies geographically, being most pronounced in southern Africa. Its general color is sandy, ginger, or dull gray to reddish-brown, with black or dark brown spots on the back, flanks, rump, and legs. Spots may turn brown and fade with age. The fur is shorter in this species than in the other extant hyaenids. The head is large, rounded and powerful, with a short and blunt muzzle. In contrast to the other extant hyaenids, all of which have pointed ears, Spotted Hyenas have ears with rounded tops. The tail ends in a black, bushy tip, with approximately 12 cm of hair extending beyond the end of the tail bone. Like the other hyaenids, the Spotted Hyena has a sloping back because the forelegs are longer than the hindlegs, and a well-developed anal gland used for scent marking. The mane in this speciesis more poorly developed than in other hyaenids. The feet have four toes. Females usually have only two teats. The Spotted Hyena has long been considered a hermaphrodite in many parts of Africa because the external genitalia of the female are very similar to those of the male. The female has a peniform clitoris that is only a few mm shorter than the male’s penis, and is fully erectile. The sexes can be distinguished by the shape of the penile glans: the male glans is pointed whereas that of the female is blunt. A single urogenital canal traverses the enlarged clitoris; through this canal the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. There is no external vaginal opening as the outer labiae are fused to form a structure that resembles the scrotal sac of the male. The female’s pseudoscrotum has a bi-lobed appearance; the testes of the adult male make the scrotal sac larger and give it more distinctly rounded bulges. Thus scientists who study these animals can distinguish males from females even when the animals are lying down. Habitat. Spotted Hyenas occupy an extraordinarily diverse array of habitats, including savanna, semi-desert, swamps, woodland, and montane forest up to 4000 m of elevation, but are absent in lowland tropical rainforests, in alpine areas at high elevation, and in extreme desert conditions. Although they require water for drinking, they are able to make do with very little water, and seldom require access to it. Even lactating females can survive without water for over one week. The highest population densities reported for this species occur on the prey-rich plains of Kenya and Tanzania , and surprisingly, in the forests of the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya . In these areas, densities of Spotted Hyenas exceed one animal per square kilometer. Food and Feeding. The foraging behavior of Spotted Hyenas is remarkably flexible. Long believed to feed mainly on carrion, these animals are in fact efficient predators that kill 60% to 95% of their prey themselves. On average across populations in which the relative proportions of hunted and scavenged foods have been documented, two thirds of their diet is derived from kills they make themselves, and only one third from scavenged food items. In addition to being able to obtain food either by hunting or scavenging, Spotted Hyenas exhibit extraordinary plasticity with respect to their prey preferences. Spotted Hyenas have catholic tastes, they are extreme opportunists, and they are able to exploit a vast array of potential prey types , ranging from caterpillars to elephants; they may also occasionally consume some plant material. However, in most parts of Africa, Spotted Hyenas derive the large majority of their food intake from only a small subset of the prey species available to them locally. In most environments, they focus on the local mediumand large-sized ungulates, capture of which yields the greatest caloric return while demanding the least effort and the fewest risks. Thus, in eastern Africa, Spotted Hyenas prey most frequently on Blue Wildebeest, zebra, gazelles and Topi. In the arid parts of southern Africa, they prey most frequently on Gemsbok. In Kruger National Park, their most common prey is Impala, and in western Africa, common prey includes Red-fronted Gazelles and Hartebeest. Foraging behavior varies with the prey currently sought. Spotted Hyenas search for gazelle fawns by wandering upwind through open grassland in a zig-zag pattern. They may dig for crocodile eggs along large rivers, and snap flying termites out of the air with their jaws. When hunting, Spotted Hyenas modify their behavior to take advantage of the most abundant prey species, or the species thatis easiest to catch; these change seasonally in some localities with the migratory movements of particular ungulate species. Instead of using felid-like stealth as a primary hunting tactic, Spotted Hyenas rely on their extraordinary endurance for success in hunting. They can run at speeds of up to 55 km /h, but at slightly lower speeds, they can maintain a chase for several kilometres. If the antelope being chased becomes winded, and turns to defend itself with its horns, the Hyenas rush in and start tearing off pieces of the prey animal’s flesh. Like canids, Spotted Hyenas kill their prey by disembowelling and dismembering them rather than by using a particularkilling bite. Spotted Hyenas may hunt either solitarily or in groups; in the latter case group size varies with the type of prey sought. Mean hunting group sizes among Hyenas in Kenya are 1-2 for Topi, 1-7 for Impala, 2-08 for Thompson's Gazelle, 2-92 for Blue Wildebeest, and 9-1 for zebra. Thus only zebra hunts involve large groups of hunters, and most hunting parties contain only one or two Hyenas. Ungulates such as Topi and Blue Wildebeest weigh roughly three times as much as an adult Hyena, but solitary Hyenas routinely kill these antelope. Although hunting group size is often surprisingly small among Spotted Hyenas, the feeding groups formed by these animals are often very large once a prey animal has been killed. The noise produced by feeding Hyenas often draws members of the clan that were not involved in the hunt to the kill site. Feeding competition among the Hyenas present at a kill is usually very intense. In East Africa, often more than 30 Hyenas can be observed trying to feed from a single carcass. Because of this intense competition, each individual Hyena consumes as much food as possible in a very short period of time. A group of 20-30 hungry Hyenas can reduce an adult Blue Wildebeest to nothing more than a pile of rumen contents in only 13 minutes. It is estimated that an adult Spotted Hyena can consume a mass of food equal to 25%-30% ofits body weight, and individual Hyenas have been observed to ingest up to 18 kg of meat and bone in one hour. However,as a result of limited access to carcasses, average food intake ranges only from 1-5 to 3-8 kg per day. Spotted Hyenas sometimes engage in kleptoparasitism, which is the aggressive acquisition of a fresh carcass from other predators. They have been observed displacingjackals, Striped Hyenas, Leopards, Cheetahs, and African Wild Dogs from kills. However Spotted Hyenas most frequently compete for kills with Lions. Spotted Hyenas and Lions occur sympatrically in many areas of Africa, and in most of these habitats, bi-directional food stealing has been observed between these two species. Dominance relations between Spotted Hyenas and competing species are not absolute but depend on the numerical presence of both parties. For instance, Lions usually displace Spotted Hyenas at kills. However, if Hyena group size is large and the ratio of Spotted Hyenas to female and subadult Lions exceeds four to one, Hyenas are often able to displace Lions from kills unless a male Lion is present. A single Spotted Hyena can usually dominate a Cheetah, Leopard, Striped Hyena, Brown Hyena, any species ofjackal, or an African Wild Dog. Spotted Hyenas have been observed caching surplus food in thickets and under water in ponds. These animals are very comfortable in water; they often play in seasonal pools, and lie in shallow water or wet mud to keep cool on hot days. Compared to the other bone-cracking hyenas, Spotted Hyenas rarely carry food to their young at dens. This appears to be because the risk of having one’s food stolen, even by much smaller hyenas,is very high at dens, particularly for low-ranking individuals. Activity patterns. Spotted Hyenas are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular, although they may be active at midday when temperatures permit. Dens are typically modified holes dug by Aardvarks, although caves are used as den sites in some areas. Only cubslive in dens; adults sleep above ground, often in thickets, particularly when midday temperatures are high. Although Spotted Hyenas are active for roughly one third of each 24hour cycle, their activity is not continuous. Instead, activity occurs in bouts interspersed with periods of rest. Hyenas in Kenya that were followed for complete 24hour cycles spent 32% of their time active, but 53% of their active time occurred during hours of darkness. Movements, Home range and Social organization. On average, Spotted Hyenas in Kenya move 928 m per hour when active, and typically travel over 12 km during each 24hour period, with males moving more than females. In Serengeti, daily movements may be much greater than this, as resident hyenas often commute 30-40 km in orderto feed on migratory herbivores. Spotted Hyenas live in social groups, called clans, which contain from ten to eighty members. Large clans contain multiple matrilines of related females and their offspring, as well as a number of adult immigrant males that are generally unrelated to one another. Small clans may contain only a single matriline and a single breeding male. Clan size appears to be determined by abundance of local prey animals: where these are plentiful, as on the prey-rich plains of eastern Africa, clans are typically very large, but in desert areas of southern Africa, clans may be tiny. Clans are fission-fusion societies. That is, all clan members know each other individually, occupy a common territory, and rear their cubs together at a communal den, yet they also spend much of their time alone or in small sub-groups. Spotted Hyena clans bear little resemblance to canid packs or Lion prides, but they are remarkably similar in their size, structure, and complexity to the societies of cercopithecine primates. Like troops of baboons and macaques, Hyena clans typically contain individuals from multiple overlapping generations, and clans are structured by clear linear dominance hierarchies in which an individual’s rank determinesits priority of access to food and other resources. In contrast to the situation characteristic of other hyaenids and most other mammals, female Spotted Hyenas are socially dominant to all adult immigrant males. Rank relationships among female clan-mates are usually stable for periods of many years. Average relatedness among females from different matrilines within a clan is extremely low. Like most primates, Spotted Hyenas produce tiny litters at long intervals, and their offspring require an unusually long period of nutritional dependence on the mother. Young Hyenas typically nurse for well over a year, and because it takes them years to become proficient at hunting and feeding, their mothers continue to help them gain access to food at ungulate kills long after weaning. Similar to female baboons, the social status of a female Hyena is determined not by hersize or fighting ability, but by her mother’s social rank. Indeed, the acquisition of social rank during early development occurs in a pattern identical to that seen in many monkey species, a pattern called “maternal rank inheritance” by primatologists even though no literal inheritance occurs involving genetic transfer of status from mother to offspring. Instead, in both Hyenas and baboons, maternal rank “inheritance” involves a great deal of important social learning that occurs during a protractedjuvenile period. Young Hyenas initially direct their aggressive behaviors equally at higherand lower-ranking individuals. But this changes rapidly during the first year of life as cubs learn to direct aggression only at animals lower in rank than their own mother. When youngsters become involved in disputes with group-mates, the mother intervenes on their behalf against all individuals lower-ranking than herself. Interventions by high-ranking mothers are more frequent and more effective than those by lowranking females. In addition, like young baboons, Hyena cubs are often joined in fights by coalition partners who may be either kin or unrelated animals. Along with maternal interventions, coalition formation functions importantly in rank acquisition. Thus the mechanisms by which youngsters acquire their social ranks are virtually identical in Hyenas and old-world monkeys. Patterns of competition and cooperation among Spotted Hyenas are also remarkably like those found in baboons. Although Hyenas compete intensively for food, they also rely heavily on cooperative interactions with group-mates, particularly their close kin, to acquire and defend both their social rank and such key resources as food and territory. Young Spotted Hyenas of both sexes “inherit” the social rank of their motherearly in life, and retain their maternal rank as long as they remain in the natal clan. However, whereas females remain in their natal group throughouttheir lives, virtually all males disperse after puberty tojoin a new clan. When a male immigrates into a new group, he entersas the lowest-ranking Hyena in the dominance hierarchy; he behaves submissively to all Hyenas he encounters in the new territory, regardless of their size, fighting ability, or social rank. This results in a society in which adult females and their cubs are dominant to all adult male immigrants. A male Hyena loses his maternal social rank and its associated feeding privileges when he disperses. In their new clans, immigrant males sometimes invest a great deal of time and energy in developing amicable relationships with resident adult females, as males engaging in these amicable relationships may enjoy a high probability ofsiring cubs. Due to the female’s male-like genitalia, coercive sex is impossible, so female choice of mates is an important sexually selected force in this species. Mate choice by female Spotted Hyenas apparently drives males to disperse: females strongly prefer to mate with immigrants, and they appear to discriminate against adult natal males. Therefore, almost all offspring are sired by immigrant males. Immigrants queue for status within the male hierarchy of the new clan; the highest-ranking males are those that immigrated first into the clan. Malesrise in rank only when higherranking immigrants die or engage in secondary dispersal; roughly 40% of immigrants disperse again, although the potential benefits of secondary dispersal are unknown. Clan members defend group territories from neighboring Hyena groups. Territory size ranges from roughly 20 km ?® in East Africa to approximately 1500 km ? in the desert regions of southern Africa, and is negatively related to the density of available prey. Territorial behavior is exhibited by both sexes, although females engage in these activities more frequently than males. Intruders encountered within the territory are usually chased to the territory boundary. Border clashes with neighboring clans, called “clan wars”, are most commonly observed in habitats containing high densities of Hyenas, where intrusion pressure is most intense. Territorial behavioris rarely observed among Spotted Hyenas inhabiting the vast desert regions of southern Africa, where prey are sparse, clan size is small, intrusion pressure is low, and the home ranges of resident hyenas are enormous. In some parts of Africa, where densities of resident prey may be low but where migratory herbivores are available as prey, Spotted Hyenas are known to adopt patterns of space-use that differ strikingly from those seen in areas with year-round resident prey. Specifically, Spotted Hyenas may frequently commute long distances from their defended territory to herds of migratory prey. In the unusual “commuting system” exhibited by Spotted Hyenas in the Serengeti, individuals travel long distances north or south from their centrally-located clan territories in order to feed on migratory herbivores. Intruders are tolerated by territory residents when the intruders are merely passing through, although residents behave aggressively toward intruders found hunting or feeding. In Namibia , Spotted Hyenas defend territories that expand and contract in size seasonally, as migratory prey change locations. Territory boundaries are visited sporadically by multiple clan members performing border patrols, during which boundaries are marked by pasting. A strong-smelling, yellowish buttery secretion is deposited from the anal glands onto grass stalks during border patrols. Spotted Hyenas also commonly paste deep inside their territories, although the frequency with which this occurs is generally far less than in the other hyaenid species. The paste transmits information about an individual’s identity, sex, reproductive state, and clan membership. Young Hyenas engage in pasting behavior long before there is any paste in their anal sacs, suggesting that this behavior enables cubs to acquire group odors from sites where clan-mates had pasted earlier. Spotted Hyenas engage in ritualized greeting ceremonies in which two individuals stand parallel and face in opposite directions. Both individuals usually lift the hindleg nearest to the other and sniff or lick the anogenital region of the other. The unique aspect of their greetingsis the prominent role of the erect “penis” in animals of both sexes. This is used to signal submission. Greetings occur between hyenas of all ages and both sexes, although greetings between adult females and adult males are uncommon and restricted to high-ranking males. Cubs can erect their penis or clitoris and engage in greeting ceremonies as early as four weeks after birth. Spotted Hyenas recognize their group mates based on visual cues, odors, and individually distinctive vocalizations. These animals are well known fortheirrich vocal repertoire. They emit deep groansto call their cubs out of dens, high-pitched whines to beg for food or milk, and cattle-like lowing sounds to bring group-mates to a common state of high arousal. The sound most frequently heard during the night throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa is the long-distance vocalization of the Spotted Hyena, called a whoop. This loud call can be heard over several kilometers. Whoopsclearly serve a variety of functions. They can be rallying calls to gather scattered clan members together to defend territory boundaries, food resources, the communal den, or clan-mates in danger. Mothers whoop to locate their wandering cubs, and hungry cubs whoop to call their mothers so they can nurse. Spotted Hyenas sometimes whoop to recruit hunting partners. Whoops are also used as a form of individual display, particularly by males of high rank. Adult males whoop more frequently than females, and high-ranking males whoop more often than lower ranking males. Finally, Spotted Hyenas are well known for their laugh or giggle, which sounds much like maniacal human laughter. This vocalization is a signal of submission. A submissive individual giggles to signal to another Hyena thatit accepts a lower status. Breeding. Females bear young throughout the year in most parts of Africa, although there are distinct birth peaks and troughs in some populations. Both sexes mate promiscuously with multiple partners. Courtship by male Spotted Hyenas is unusual among mammals because it appears to reflect such extreme conflicting desires to approach the female and also to flee from her. Males often engage in approach-avoid and bowing displays, both of which appear to reflect strong motivational conflict and hesitancy on the part of the male. Their behavior suggests that interactions with females may be unusually risky for males in this species, and that males fear females. In general, the female seems to take little notice of the male hyena’s sexual advances. Estrus lasts 1-3 days, but the length of the female's cycle, and whether ovulation is spontaneous or induced, are not known. Copulation involves multiple mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations. Female receptivity is indicated by inhibited aggression toward the male and by assumption of a distinctive receptive stance in which the female lowers her head and keeps her mouth near the ground. The only behavior indicative of a female's interest in mating is that she may follow a male. Some males who sire cubs form consortships with females, but others do not, suggesting that individual male Hyenas may adopt multiple alternative reproductive tactics to attract and acquire mates. That is, male Hyenas may sometimes “shadow” or “guard” their mates, but intensive mate-guarding is not required to ensure that a male will sire the cubs of a particular female. Females have been observed mating with one to four males within a single estrous period, and multiple paternity has been documented to occur in 25-30% of twin litters. Many copulations among Crocuta appear to be infertile. Female Spotted Hyenas are exposed to high concentrations of androgens in utero, and this early androgen exposure may have negative effects on female fertility by altering ovarian histology or other mechanisms. It has recently been determined that early androgen exposure is not necessary for formation of the female's peniform clitoris. Females give birth through their penis-like clitoris. During parturition, the clitoris tears to permit the passage of the young, creating a large bleeding wound on the posterior surface that may take weeks to heal. Females usually produce litters of two, although singletons are also common, and triplets are observed occasionally. Cubs weigh roughly 1 kg at birth. They are born with their eyes open, their deciduous canine and incisor teeth fully erupted, and they are capable of remarkably coordinated movement immediately after birth. They are thus relatively precocial compared to cubs in other hyaenid species or in most other carnivores. Their coats are pure black at birth; cubs start to molt at 5-6 weeks of age, and the natal coat is completely replaced by an adult-colored, spotted pelage by 4-5 months of age. The spots never change except to fade a bit with age. Cubs are usually born in an isolated natal den and are transferred to the clan’s communal den when they are 2-5 weeks old. They remain at the communal den until they are 8-12 months old, and then begin traveling around the clan’s territory, initially with their mothers and later alone. As in the other bone-cracking hyenas, weaning occurs surprisingly late, usually around 13-14 months of age, but twin litters borne by low-ranking females may be nursed as long as two years. Fifty percent of cubs die before puberty, and mortality rates are generally highest immediately after weaning. Males reach reproductive maturity at around two years of age, and most females start bearing young in their third or fourth year. However, age at first parturition varies between two and six years. All females in a clan reproduce, and females rear their young together in the communal den. Therefore occupied dens may contain up to 30 young of different ages from up to 20 litters. Females nurse only their own cubs and usually reject approaches by other cubs. The milk of Spotted Hyenas has the highest protein content (mean 14-9%) recorded for any terrestrial carnivore, a fat content (mean 141%) exceeded only by that of palaearctic bears and the sea otter, and a higher gross energy density than the milk of most other terrestrial carnivores. Due to the high energy content of their milk, and the long nursing period, Spotted Hyenas have the highest energetic investment per litter of any carnivore. Reproductive success in both sexes is related to dominancestatus, although this relationship is stronger among females than males. High-ranking females enjoy greater reproductive success than low-ranking females because they have longer reproductive life spans and shorter inter-birth intervals, and because their cubs experience lower mortality than do cubs of low-ranking females. Sex ratios among adults are usually slightly female-biased. Reproductive success among males varies with intra-sexual rank, although alpha males fare more poorly than would be expected based on social status alone. As most males disperse from their natal clan when they are at least two years old, most breeding males are immigrants. Spotted Hyenas are sometimes referred to as the “Cain and Abel” of the animal world because of the common belief that they routinely kill their siblings shortly after birth. Although littermates do engage in aggressive interactions within minutes after birth, and although this can result in obvious scarring of the subordinate littermate, these aggressive interactions seldom result in the death of a sibling. These early fights quickly lead to the establishment of a dominance relationship that allows the dominant cub to control access to the mother’s milk. Siblicide in the Spotted Hyena is facultative in that it occurs only in some twin litters rather than routinely. The purpose of the early fighting is to establish an unambiguous dominance relationship within the litter. It appears that the relative costs and benefits of killing one’s sibling vary with current socio-ecological conditions: a cub that killsits sibling may obtain significant benefits if its mother is unable to support multiple cubs. However, mothers can usually support two cubs in many parts of Africa without undue difficulty. Status and Conservation. Listed as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The total world population of the Spotted Hyena is well above 10,000 individuals, several subpopulations exceed 1000 individuals and its range well exceeds 20,000 km ®. The rapid decline of populations outside conservation areas due to persecution and habitat loss makes the species increasingly dependent on the continued existence of protected areas. Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated in Algeria and Lesotho , and they are listed as threatened in Benin , Burundi , Cameroon , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , Rwanda , and Sierra Leone . The largest remaining populations are found in Kenya , Tanzania , South Africa , and Namibia . Most adult mortality is caused directly by lions and humans,although disease is an important mortality source in some areas. Human-caused mortality is common even inside protected areas. Spotted Hyenas may attack livestock, particularly where natural prey are usually or seasonally sparse. Often in response to confirmed or assumed livestock depredation, Spotted Hyenas are shot, snared, speared, or poisoned in many parts of their range by ranchers and pastoralists. Spotted Hyenas are also commonly killed on motor-ways. Habitat fragmentation and reduction are also having significant negative effects on the size of many Spotted Hyena populations. Finally, one of the most important threats to the conservation of Spotted Hyenas is their negative public image. Many people apparently believe these animals are not worth conserving. Educating the public about these complex and fascinating animals is expected to have a substantial positive effect on conservation efforts. Bibliography.

Although previously placed in its own family (Protelidae), it is now considered a member of the family Hyaenidae . The Aardwolf belongs to the subfamily Protelinae , of which it is the only extant member. They occur in two distinct populations separated by about 1500 km . However, studies ofthe extent of genetic and morphological differences between these groups have not been conducted. Two subspecies are recognized.","P. c. cristata Sparrman, 1783 — E African coast (S Egypt , Sudan , Eritrea , Djibouti , Ethiopia , Somalia , Kenya , NE Uganda to C Tanzania ). P. c. septentrionalis Rothschild, 1902 — most of S Africa (S Angola , S Zambia , SW Mozambique , Namibia , Botswana , Zimbabwe , Swaziland , Lesotho , and South Africa ).","By far the smallest of the four hyaenid species. Head-body 55-80 cm, tail 20-30 cm, height at shoulder 45-50 cm; weight (adult) 8-12 kg with seasonal variation, and reported as high as 14 kg . No sexual size dimorphism. Superficially similar in appearance to the Striped Hyena, with dark vertical stripes on a buff, yellowish-white or rufous body, and irregular horizontal stripes on the legs. However, the Striped Hyena is more than twice as large with less regular striping. The Aardwolf’s coat is about 2-5 cm long, with longer hairs along the mane and in the bushy tail. The neck is long and the throat is a pale gray-white. The legs are long and slender and the striping terminates in black at the feet. As in the Striped and Brown Hyena, the Aardwolf has long, pointed ears and a long erectile mane extending the length ofits body. Like the other hyaenids, Proteles has a sloping back with the forelegs longer than the hindlegs, and a well-developed anal gland used for scent marking. Females have two pairs of teats. Uniquely among the hyaenids, Profeles has a number of adaptations for feeding exclusively on termites, including a long, spatulate tongue with large and varied papillae, and a large submaxillary gland which produces copious amounts of sticky saliva. Very small peg-like cheek teeth are widely spaced along thejaw margins, yet large canines have been retained for use in territorial disputes with other Aardwolves and defense againstjackals. Their skulls also feature a relatively broad, nearly parallel-sided palate, and extraordinarily large tympanic bulla.","Aardwolves are primarily found on open, grassy plains or in bush country, but can live in a range of habitats with rainfall between 100-800 mm. They are most common where rainfall is 100-600 mm. They do not occur in forests or pure desert and are independent of drinking water. The northern subspecies occurs in grasslands and tree savannas of the Somali-Masai Arid Zone and the southern subspecies in the Southern Savanna and South-west Arid Zone.","Aardwolves are solitary foragers and feed almost exclusively on Trinervitermes termites, usually on one species in each particular region: 1. bettionianus in East Africa, 1. rhodesiensis in Zimbabwe and Botswana and 71. trinervoides in South Africa . These termites are largely avoided by other termite-eating mammals due to the noxious terpenoid chemicals secreted by the soldier termites, to which the Aardwolfis uniquely tolerant. In addition to the lack of competition, Aardwolf preference for this termite genus is likely due to the fact that these termites regularly congregate at night in large aboveground foraging parties. The termites are licked directly from the soil surface, and are easily obtainable in large quantities. Also, unlike true harvester termites, Trinervitermes forage throughout the year, making them a dependable year-round food source. Due to the small size of Trinervitermes and the wide dispersion of colonies, female Aardwolves must forage for at least six hours a night, during which up to 300,000 termites/night (1-2 kg) are consumed. Foraging Aardwolves travel approximately 1 km /h, with their ears cocked forward and head bentslightly down, following an erratic zig-zag route. Because they often approach termite colonies from downwind, and approach with directed movement before termites could be seen,it appears that termite foraging parties are detected at least partially by smell. However, the hearing of the Aardwolf is particularly acute and is assumed to play a role in colony detection. The average time spent foraging at individual termite patches was 20-28 seconds in East Africa, but in drier Namibian grassland, Aardwolves spent an average of 1-8 and 9-2 minutes at each patch in consecutive years of observation. In South Africa , a newly weaned four-month old cub spent an average of only eleven seconds at each patch, and juveniles frequently are seen vomiting after feeding on Trinervitermes, indicating that tolerance to the chemical secretions of Trinervitermes soldiers increases with age. Even adult Aardwolves maintain some aversion to the terpene chemicals, because they will avoid feeding on mounds under repair, where typically only dense concentrations of soldiers are found at the surface. Other surface-foraging termites, particularly Hodotermes and Microhodotermes ( South Africa ), Odontotermes and Macrotermes species (East Africa), make up a larger proportion of the diet when Trinervitermes are seasonally uncommon or unavailable, as during winter (May-August) in South Africa , and during the rainy season in East Africa. However, these species forage aboveground in much smaller parties (10-20 individuals vs. 4000 in Trinervitermes) and the reduced winter availability of Trinervitermes in South Africa results in a significant seasonal reduction in Aardwolf body weight and field metabolic rate. Aardwolves here were found to consume only one-sixth the number of termites in winter that they did in summer. Winter is also the highest period of mortality in Aardwolf cubs, which are 7-10 months old at this time, further indicating that this is a period ofsignificant energetic stress. Other termites found in fecal samples have included Odontotermes, Macrotermes, and Lepidotermes that are not surface-foraging species and therefore not important components of the Aardwolf diet. Occasional additional food items include ants and Coleopterans, yet the Aardwolf appears to be surprisingly inefficient at foraging on non-termite insects. Due to the high degree of specialization of its tongue for licking small arthropods, and the almost complete degeneration ofits cheek teeth, it is thought that they are unable to handle larger food items, making the species highly dependent on Trinervitermes. This dependence is supported by the absence of Aardwolves from Zambia and central and western Africa, where surface foraging Trinervitermes are either uncommon or available only a small part of the year. Aardwolves defecate in middens (also called latrines). The first defecation occurs when they exit the burrow in the evening and is typically very large, weighing up to 1 kg . Defecations are typically covered with soil. This practice of concentrating and burying their faeces, which retains some of the terpene smell of the soldier termites, has been suggested as a way of reducing the probability that an Aardwolf will mistake its own faeces for a termite colony when it is foraging. Up to 20 middens may be located in a territory. Activity patterns. Predominantly nocturnal, in South Africa Aardwolves are generally active for 8-9 hours a day in summer but only 3-4 hours a day in winter. In summer, they generally leave the den within an hour after sunset and return 1-4 hours before sunrise. However, during winter, some diurnal activity may be observed. Aardwolves typically become active up to an hour before sunset and return to their dens after 3—4 hours of foraging. A higher proportion of their time is spent feeding in winter than in summer, and a relatively large portion of the activity of both males and females in winter (12:6%) consists of breeding activities (e.g. courtship/copulation). Inactive hours during the day are spent in underground dens, which provide refuge from temperature extremes and predators, particularly Black-backed Jackals. Dens also function importantly in cub-rearing. Nighttime rest periods are also often spent near or inside dens. A territory may include up to ten different den holes, which are typically spring hare burrows that have been enlarged by Aardwolves. Movements, Home range and Social organization. A social unit, which occupies a welldefined territory throughout the year, consists of a male-female pair and their most recent offspring. All natal animals disperse from the territory, usually 1-2 months before birth of the nextlitter. Pair bonds arefairly stable lasting 2-5 years. Males without mates (due to death or abandonment by females) establish pair bonds with adjacent females and may abandon their originalterritories. Territory size ranges from 1-5 km? in East Africa to 3-8 km? in South Africa , and appears to be negatively related to the density of available termite mounds. Territories in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa generally supported 3000 termite mounds with an average of 55,000 termites/mound. Aardwolf density reaches 1 adult /km? in optimal habitat. Territories are maintained primarily by scent marking, which is concentrated along territory boundaries, but direct interactions between neighboring residents also occasionally occur. Both males and females actively defend territorial boundaries. Chasing and fighting, with manes raised, occurs between same-sex individuals defending territories. Intruders encountered within the territory are usually chased to the boundary and mutual avoidance is generally practiced along boundary areas. If physical contact occurs both combatants drop to their carpals and bite at each others’ necks. Although territorial behavior is exhibited by males and females,it differs between mating (June andJuly in South Africa ) and non-mating seasons. Direct fights between Aardwolves appear restricted to the mating season. Whereas females tend to stay within territory boundaries year round, male behavior undergoes a marked change at the start of the mating season. After an approximately one-month “scouting” period at the beginning of the mating season, when males make frequent extra-territorial movements, yet largely refrain from pasting outside the territory, they begin more aggressive extra-territorial pasting. Their movements outside the territory continue to increase, peaking in frequency about a week before females come into estrus. These excursions are suggested to be advertizements of quality to both males and females in surrounding territories. Males engage in consecutive over-markings by pasting on particular grass stalks; the less aggressive, and apparently less fit, individual will eventually cease pasting, thus “losing” the contest. During pre-estrus females also increase their rate of pasting, primarily along territory boundaries and just outside them, apparently to encourage visits by extra-pair males. Visiting males during this period frequently “flirt” with resident females and chase or fight males that they encounter. “Flirting” typically involves the male running toward the female, then veering off and prancing past with his tail raised. However, by the time the female is in estrus (lasting 1-3 days) she is typically left with only her resident male, and potentially an aggressive neighbor. As in Striped Hyenas, there have been cases in which two male Aardwolves shared a territory with a female, both males mating with her and both guarding her cubs, but this appears to be exceptional and rare. Aardwolves are remarkably antisocial outside the breeding season. Members of resident mixed-sex pairs feed alone and typically ignore each other when they meet. Unlike the other three hyaenids, Aardwolves usually do not engage in greeting ceremonies between familiar individuals, with the exception of an occasional muzzle to muzzle sniff between mother and cub. In South Africa , nightly distance traveled by foraging females ranged from 1-5 to 9-1 km (average 4-2 km). Summer travel distances ranged from 8-12 km per night, whereas winter distances were highly variable (from less than 3 km to more than 24 km ) depending on whether males were conducting extra-territorial mating forays. Travel speed is 2-3 km/h when not feeding, and about I km/h when feeding intensely. Aardwolves return to underground burrows during the day. There are typically 5-6 dens per territory. Dens are used for only 1-2 months at a time, and mates rarely use the same dens concurrently. Because Aardwolves rarely interact, the primary form of communication is olfactory. Like the other three hyaenids, the Aardwolf engages in scent marking behavior called pasting, during which a strong-smelling, yellowish-orange secretion (which quickly turns black) is deposited onto grass stalks from an extruded anal gland, located just above the anus. In addition to marking frequently at dens and latrines, which generally are not associated with territory boundaries, Aardwolves appear to use pasting as a means of territory defense. Boundary marking occurs most frequently, and is most concentrated along borders where neighboring Aardwolves maintain territories. Pasting is generally frequent, occurring about twice every 100 m of travel, and about 200 times per night, with males pasting more than females. Based on experiments with translocated scent marks, information conveyed in scent marks appears to include the sex, female reproductive state, and individual identity, at least in the case of resident neighbors, partners, and self-recognition. Outside the mating season, pasting outside territory boundaries is rare if not nonexistent, but this behavior, particularly by males, changes notably during mating periods. Even though direct interactions are rare, Aardwolves possess an impressive visual display, during which the hairs along the mane are erected, resulting in a near doubling of the apparent size of the animal. This is used in intraspecific aggressive interactions involving territory defense and in interspecific defensive interactions. Although generally a silent species, the most comprehensive analysis of the vocal repertoire of Proteles identified nine distinct sound types : “purr”, whine, jaw click, lip smack, growl, snarl, bark, squeal, and a whizzing sound which was only documented in one individual. Agonistic vocalizations are relatively diverse and increase in intensity in the following order: lip smack/jaw click, growl, snarl, bark. Squeals are heard only in cubs and appear to represent begging to mothers. The whineelicits a variety of reactions depending on the addressee and addressor, but likely functions as an appeasing or reassuring sound. As in striped and brown hyenas, Aardwolves lack a loud, longdistance vocalization like the whoop of spotted hyenas. On following pages: 2. Spotted Hyena ( Crocuta crocuta ); 3. Striped Hyena ( Hyaena hyaena ); 4. Brown Hyena ( Parahyaena brunnea ).",,"Predominantly nocturnal, in South Africa Aardwolves are generally active for 8-9 hours a day in summer but only 3-4 hours a day in winter. In summer, they generally leave the den within an hour after sunset and return 1-4 hours before sunrise. However, during winter, some diurnal activity may be observed. Aardwolves typically become active up to an hour before sunset and return to their dens after 3—4 hours of foraging. A higher proportion of their time is spent feeding in winter than in summer, and a relatively large portion of the activity of both males and females in winter (12:6%) consists of breeding activities (e.g. courtship/copulation). Inactive hours during the day are spent in underground dens, which provide refuge from temperature extremes and predators, particularly Black-backed Jackals. Dens also function importantly in cub-rearing. Nighttime rest periods are also often spent near or inside dens. A territory may include up to ten different den holes, which are typically spring hare burrows that have been enlarged by Aardwolves.","A social unit, which occupies a welldefined territory throughout the year, consists of a male-female pair and their most recent offspring. All natal animals disperse from the territory, usually 1-2 months before birth of the nextlitter. Pair bonds arefairly stable lasting 2-5 years. Males without mates (due to death or abandonment by females) establish pair bonds with adjacent females and may abandon their originalterritories. Territory size ranges from 1-5 km? in East Africa to 3-8 km? in South Africa , and appears to be negatively related to the density of available termite mounds. Territories in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa generally supported 3000 termite mounds with an average of 55,000 termites/mound. Aardwolf density reaches 1 adult /km? in optimal habitat. Territories are maintained primarily by scent marking, which is concentrated along territory boundaries, but direct interactions between neighboring residents also occasionally occur. Both males and females actively defend territorial boundaries. Chasing and fighting, with manes raised, occurs between same-sex individuals defending territories. Intruders encountered within the territory are usually chased to the boundary and mutual avoidance is generally practiced along boundary areas. If physical contact occurs both combatants drop to their carpals and bite at each others’ necks. Although territorial behavior is exhibited by males and females,it differs between mating (June andJuly in South Africa ) and non-mating seasons. Direct fights between Aardwolves appear restricted to the mating season. Whereas females tend to stay within territory boundaries year round, male behavior undergoes a marked change at the start of the mating season. After an approximately one-month “scouting” period at the beginning of the mating season, when males make frequent extra-territorial movements, yet largely refrain from pasting outside the territory, they begin more aggressive extra-territorial pasting. Their movements outside the territory continue to increase, peaking in frequency about a week before females come into estrus. These excursions are suggested to be advertizements of quality to both males and females in surrounding territories. Males engage in consecutive over-markings by pasting on particular grass stalks; the less aggressive, and apparently less fit, individual will eventually cease pasting, thus “losing” the contest. During pre-estrus females also increase their rate of pasting, primarily along territory boundaries and just outside them, apparently to encourage visits by extra-pair males. Visiting males during this period frequently “flirt” with resident females and chase or fight males that they encounter. “Flirting” typically involves the male running toward the female, then veering off and prancing past with his tail raised. However, by the time the female is in estrus (lasting 1-3 days) she is typically left with only her resident male, and potentially an aggressive neighbor. As in Striped Hyenas, there have been cases in which two male Aardwolves shared a territory with a female, both males mating with her and both guarding her cubs, but this appears to be exceptional and rare. Aardwolves are remarkably antisocial outside the breeding season. Members of resident mixed-sex pairs feed alone and typically ignore each other when they meet. Unlike the other three hyaenids, Aardwolves usually do not engage in greeting ceremonies between familiar individuals, with the exception of an occasional muzzle to muzzle sniff between mother and cub. In South Africa , nightly distance traveled by foraging females ranged from 1-5 to 9-1 km (average 4-2 km). Summer travel distances ranged from 8-12 km per night, whereas winter distances were highly variable (from less than 3 km to more than 24 km ) depending on whether males were conducting extra-territorial mating forays. Travel speed is 2-3 km/h when not feeding, and about I km/h when feeding intensely. Aardwolves return to underground burrows during the day. There are typically 5-6 dens per territory.

Striped Hyena ( Hyaena hyaena ); 4. Brown Hyena ( Parahyaena brunnea ). Breeding. Monogamous, yet during the mating season extra-pair copulations can be common (40% in South Africa ). Strictly seasonal breeding in the Northern Cape where most mating occurs during the first two weeks ofJuly. Females give birth every year in early October to 1-4 cubs (average of 2-5), after a 90day gestation period. In more northern parts of the range, breeding seasons appear to be less restricted. Estrus lasts 1-3 days but females may cycle again within two weeks if fertilization does not occur. Copulation lasts from 1-4-5 hours during which multiple ejaculations occur. Copulations may be interrupted by extra-pair males and in some cases females copulate with these new males. Cubs are born in a den and rarely emerge above ground during the first month. By three months, cubs have begun making short excursions from the den, usually accompanied by an adult. Weaning occurs around four months, and by this time cubs begin foraging alone within the territory. After weaning, cubs spend little time with their parents, are independent by about seven months, and are excluded from the territory soon after, usually by one year of age. Cubs grow quickly, reaching adult body mass by 3:6 months. Thisis likely an adaptation to maximize survival of cubs through their first winter, when cub mortality is highest. Sexual maturity is reached by 1-8 years. Each resident breeding male guards the female’s cubs during the period of den dependence. This is energetically costly asit typically leaves the males only 2-3 hours of foraging time before sunrise, compared to at least six hours for females. Due to the frequency of extrapair copulations, cuckoldry appears to be an established aspect of the mating system (“overt cuckoldry”), and males are likely to frequently help raise litters of mixed paternity or sired entirely by other males. Currently this appears to be unique among mammals.","Listed as a species of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Due to their shy and nocturnal nature, Aardwolves are probably more common than usually believed. That notwithstanding, Aardwolves in southern Africa generally occur outside of protected areas, and the primary threat in these locationsis indirect poisoning aimed at locust outbreaks. Poisoning events can result in the death of up to half the local adult population and all the cubs. Within protected areas, the most important mortality sources are severe drought and predation on cubs by Black-backed Jackals. Human-caused mortality also occurs as a result of direct persecution from farmers suspecting Aardwolf involvement in lamb predation, harvesting of Aardwolves as a food source, and indirect persecution during organized hunting for jackals. Aardwolves may also be killed by vehicles during the night. However, all these other mortality sources appear insignificant relative to poisoning, jackal predation and drought. Across its range, habitat fragmentation and isolation may be the most serious threat to long-term population viability; however,its dependence on habitat preferred for use in livestock grazing makes extensive habitat loss improbable.","Anderson, M.D. & Richardson (2005) | Anderson, M.D. et al.

Aardwolf Proteles cristata French: Protele / German: Erdwolf / Spanish: Proteles Taxonomy. Viverra cristata Sparrman, 1783 , Eastern Cape Province , South Africa . Although previously placed in its own family (Protelidae), it is now considered a member of the family Hyaenidae . The Aardwolf belongs to the subfamily Protelinae , of which it is the only extant member. They occur in two distinct populations separated by about 1500 km . However, studies ofthe extent of genetic and morphological differences between these groups have not been conducted. Two subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. P. c. cristata Sparrman, 1783 — E African coast (S Egypt , Sudan , Eritrea , Djibouti , Ethiopia , Somalia , Kenya , NE Uganda to C Tanzania ). P. c. septentrionalis Rothschild, 1902 — most of S Africa (S Angola , S Zambia , SW Mozambique , Namibia , Botswana , Zimbabwe , Swaziland , Lesotho , and South Africa ). Descriptive notes. By far the smallest of the four hyaenid species. Head-body 55-80 cm, tail 20-30 cm, height at shoulder 45-50 cm; weight (adult) 8-12 kg with seasonal variation, and reported as high as 14 kg . No sexual size dimorphism. Superficially similar in appearance to the Striped Hyena, with dark vertical stripes on a buff, yellowish-white or rufous body, and irregular horizontal stripes on the legs. However, the Striped Hyena is more than twice as large with less regular striping. The Aardwolf’s coat is about 2-5 cm long, with longer hairs along the mane and in the bushy tail. The neck is long and the throat is a pale gray-white. The legs are long and slender and the striping terminates in black at the feet. As in the Striped and Brown Hyena, the Aardwolf has long, pointed ears and a long erectile mane extending the length ofits body. Like the other hyaenids, Proteles has a sloping back with the forelegs longer than the hindlegs, and a well-developed anal gland used for scent marking. Females have two pairs of teats. Uniquely among the hyaenids, Profeles has a number of adaptations for feeding exclusively on termites, including a long, spatulate tongue with large and varied papillae, and a large submaxillary gland which produces copious amounts of sticky saliva. Very small peg-like cheek teeth are widely spaced along thejaw margins, yet large canines have been retained for use in territorial disputes with other Aardwolves and defense againstjackals. Their skulls also feature a relatively broad, nearly parallel-sided palate, and extraordinarily large tympanic bulla. Habitat. Aardwolves are primarily found on open, grassy plains or in bush country, but can live in a range of habitats with rainfall between 100-800 mm. They are most common where rainfall is 100-600 mm. They do not occur in forests or pure desert and are independent of drinking water. The northern subspecies occurs in grasslands and tree savannas of the Somali-Masai Arid Zone and the southern subspecies in the Southern Savanna and South-west Arid Zone. Food and Feeding. Aardwolves are solitary foragers and feed almost exclusively on Trinervitermes termites, usually on one species in each particular region: 1. bettionianus in East Africa, 1. rhodesiensis in Zimbabwe and Botswana and 71. trinervoides in South Africa . These termites are largely avoided by other termite-eating mammals due to the noxious terpenoid chemicals secreted by the soldier termites, to which the Aardwolfis uniquely tolerant. In addition to the lack of competition, Aardwolf preference for this termite genus is likely due to the fact that these termites regularly congregate at night in large aboveground foraging parties. The termites are licked directly from the soil surface, and are easily obtainable in large quantities. Also, unlike true harvester termites, Trinervitermes forage throughout the year, making them a dependable year-round food source. Due to the small size of Trinervitermes and the wide dispersion of colonies, female Aardwolves must forage for at least six hours a night, during which up to 300,000 termites/night (1-2 kg) are consumed. Foraging Aardwolves travel approximately 1 km /h, with their ears cocked forward and head bentslightly down, following an erratic zig-zag route. Because they often approach termite colonies from downwind, and approach with directed movement before termites could be seen,it appears that termite foraging parties are detected at least partially by smell. However, the hearing of the Aardwolf is particularly acute and is assumed to play a role in colony detection. The average time spent foraging at individual termite patches was 20-28 seconds in East Africa, but in drier Namibian grassland, Aardwolves spent an average of 1-8 and 9-2 minutes at each patch in consecutive years of observation. In South Africa , a newly weaned four-month old cub spent an average of only eleven seconds at each patch, and juveniles frequently are seen vomiting after feeding on Trinervitermes, indicating that tolerance to the chemical secretions of Trinervitermes soldiers increases with age. Even adult Aardwolves maintain some aversion to the terpene chemicals, because they will avoid feeding on mounds under repair, where typically only dense concentrations of soldiers are found at the surface. Other surface-foraging termites, particularly Hodotermes and Microhodotermes ( South Africa ), Odontotermes and Macrotermes species (East Africa), make up a larger proportion of the diet when Trinervitermes are seasonally uncommon or unavailable, as during winter (May-August) in South Africa , and during the rainy season in East Africa. However, these species forage aboveground in much smaller parties (10-20 individuals vs. 4000 in Trinervitermes) and the reduced winter availability of Trinervitermes in South Africa results in a significant seasonal reduction in Aardwolf body weight and field metabolic rate. Aardwolves here were found to consume only one-sixth the number of termites in winter that they did in summer. Winter is also the highest period of mortality in Aardwolf cubs, which are 7-10 months old at this time, further indicating that this is a period ofsignificant energetic stress. Other termites found in fecal samples have included Odontotermes, Macrotermes, and Lepidotermes that are not surface-foraging species and therefore not important components of the Aardwolf diet. Occasional additional food items include ants and Coleopterans, yet the Aardwolf appears to be surprisingly inefficient at foraging on non-termite insects. Due to the high degree of specialization of its tongue for licking small arthropods, and the almost complete degeneration ofits cheek teeth, it is thought that they are unable to handle larger food items, making the species highly dependent on Trinervitermes. This dependence is supported by the absence of Aardwolves from Zambia and central and western Africa, where surface foraging Trinervitermes are either uncommon or available only a small part of the year. Aardwolves defecate in middens (also called latrines). The first defecation occurs when they exit the burrow in the evening and is typically very large, weighing up to 1 kg . Defecations are typically covered with soil. This practice of concentrating and burying their faeces, which retains some of the terpene smell of the soldier termites, has been suggested as a way of reducing the probability that an Aardwolf will mistake its own faeces for a termite colony when it is foraging. Up to 20 middens may be located in a territory. Activity patterns. Predominantly nocturnal, in South Africa Aardwolves are generally active for 8-9 hours a day in summer but only 3-4 hours a day in winter. In summer, they generally leave the den within an hour after sunset and return 1-4 hours before sunrise. However, during winter, some diurnal activity may be observed. Aardwolves typically become active up to an hour before sunset and return to their dens after 3—4 hours of foraging.

Has a typical hyena appearance with front legs longer and more robust than the rear legs, a broad head and short muzzle, thick neck and short tail. Like the Striped Hyena it has large pointed ears and course shaggy fur that is longest along the back and on the tail. The general color is dark brown with lighter tawny hair on the neck and shoulders. The legs are banded with dark horizontalstripes and the front feet are large and well-developed for digging. Like the Spotted and Striped Hyenas, the Brown Hyena possesses the bonecrushing third premolar that is unique to this family. In contrast to Spotted Hyenas, there is no masculinization of the female genitalia in Brown Hyenas. Females have two to six pairs ofteats, but only the two most caudal pairs are functional.","Brown Hyenas are found in a variety of relatively arid habitats from open desert or semi-desert in the Namib and Kalahari, to dry open scrub and woodland savannah, mopani scrub and tree savannah, as well as the bushveld of the northern Transvaal. They do not need drinking water and inhabit areas where annual rainfall may be even lower than 100 mm , up to about 650 mm .","These hyenas forage alone at night and do not cooperate in hunting or in feeding, although group members tolerate each other at large food items. Although not competent hunters, Brown Hyenas are extremely efficient scavengers with an omnivorous diet. They are opportunistic feeders on a range of vertebrates, primarily mammals, the vast majority of which are scavenged, often from the kills of other carnivores. Fruits, insects and reptiles can be important supplementary foods when carcasses are rare. In one population 58 different food items were identified from fecal analysis. Brown Hyenas in the southern Kalahari spent 30% of their feeding time eating carrion, 28% on vegetable matter, 4-5% on small mammals, 1-5% on birds’ eggs, and 29% on unknown items. Only 5-8% of food they were seen eating was killed by the hyenas themselves. In the central Kalahari 35-9% ofall observed feeding bouts were on fresh scavenged kills, 33-9% on old carcasses, 16% on their own kills, and 12:5% on vegetative food sources. Brown Hyenas do not depend on standing water. In the central Kalahari, no free water orrain is typically found for eight months of the year. Although they will drink on a daily basis when water is present, much of the water during dry seasons is obtained from Cucurbitaceae fruits such as the tsama melon, gemsbok cucumber, and Hookeri melon, which can compose significant proportions of the diet in these seasons. Brown Hyenas inhabiting the Namibian coast feed almost exclusively on subadult Brown Fur Seals. The majority of these seals are thought to be scavenged, although Brown Hyenas have been seen hunting seal pups. In fact, hunting efficiency on seal pups during the peak pupping season can be as high as 47%, and an average of almost five seals per day may be killed from a single colony. Small rodents and seabirds make up the rest of this unique diet. Elsewhere hunting attempts by Brown Hyenas are opportunistic and directed at small mammals such as Springbok lambs, spring hares, Bat-eared Foxes, and ground nesting birds. The hunting technique of the Brown Hyena is unspecialized, rarely successful (except in the case of Brown Fur Seal pups), and may include a brief lunge at a surprised prey, a prolonged chase of up 1 km , or an attempt to dig up a burrowed animal. The percent of observed hunting attempts that were successful was 4:7% in the southern Kalahari and 13-7% in the central Kalahari. The hyenas generally feed where they find food, but food from larger carcasses is frequently cached nearby in a clump of grass or under a bush. Considerable time is often spent at carcasses removing limbs for this purpose and one animal may remove and cache up to three legs before any competitors arrive. Sites where food is cached are scent-marked and may be re-visited over multiple days. In a remarkable example of food caching in the southern Kalahari, a Brown Hyena arrived at an abandoned ostrich (Struthio camelus) nest with 26 eggs , which are prized food items. The hyena spent four hours carrying 14 eggs distances of 150-600 m from the nest, some of which it simply dropped in the open. It ate only three eggs during this period. Brown Hyenas also carry food back to cubs at the den. This provisioning of cubs can result in significant bone accumulations at densites. In the southern Kalahari the average distance moved between significant meals was 7-2 km, and the average nightly distance traveled was 31-1 km. During the dry season, nightly movements were longer and were recorded as high as 54-4 km. During the wet season movements were reduced and ranged from 10-20 km. In Namibia , daily distances traveled ranged from 15-47 km. When foraging, Brown Hyenas move at a pace of about 4 km /h, often walking in a zig-zag pattern, probably to maximize their chance of coming across food items. They use smell to locate much of their food, as evidenced by frequent sniffing and moving upwind toward food sources. Their hearing appears to be acute as well and is likely also used in foraging. The Brown Hyena is subordinate at kills to Spotted Hyenas, Lions and African Wild Dogs, although it appears to dominate Leopards in most situations. While they always dominate Cheetahs, they compete heavily with the much smaller Black-backed Jackal, which is often able to steal scraps from hyenas at carcasses. There is some evidence that, where they are sympatric, Brown Hyenas avoid areas frequented by Spotted Hyenas, potentially to avoid direct aggression and competition. For example, dens in the southern Kalahari were rarely found in the prey-rich riverine habitat where most Spotted Hyena dens occurred. Although their presence at livestock carcasses has resulted in much antagonism toward, and persecution of, Brown Hyenas by livestock owners, predation on livestock by these animals appears to be done by a small number of individuals. However, these hyenas, which typically target cow calves and sheep, can account for a large number of kills. Removal of these problem individuals appears effective at halting stock losses. Activity patterns. Primarily a nocturnal animal, although activity is occasionally observed during the day, particularly on cool, cloudy days during the rainy season. There are typcally two peaks of activity, from 19:30 h to 24:00 h and 2:30 h to 6:00 h, with a rest period in between. Radio-collared adults in the southern Kalahari were active for 42.6% of the 24 h period, and 80.2% of the period between 18:00 h and 06:00 h. In Namibia , three males with satellite collars spent an average of 57-1-72-3% of 24 h active. Brown Hyenas typically rest during the day in a hole, or undera large tree or bush. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Approximately 65% of Brown Hyenas in a population are members of small social groups called clans, with the remaining individuals living as nomads. Clan size ranges from 4-14 individuals, including cubs, and clans defend large stable territories. In the southern Kalahari far-ranging nomadic males (8% of the adult population) were the only males observed to breed with clan-living females, yet in the central Kalahari, breeding also occurs with resident immigrant males. In the southern Kalahari territories averaged 308 km ? (range: 215-461 km?) with never more than 20% overlap between territories. Brown Hyena density there was calculated to be 1-8 hyenas/ 100 km ?®. In the central Kalahari territories averaged 170 km ?, but varied greatly with annualrainfall, reaching a maximum of 400 km ?. In Namibia , where Brown Hyenas depend almost entirely on Brown Fur Seals along the coast, territories of two clans in one study were 31-9 km? and 220 km ? In another study the home ranges of three males ranged from 420-1460 km? with the largest home range being an inland location. Density in this latter Namibian study ranged from 1-0-2-9/ 100 km ®. In general, group size appears to be correlated with food abundance and quality within the territory, whereas territory size is influenced by the distribution of food resources. Territories are maintained primarily through scent marking behavior (called “pasting”) and aggression toward intruders. Clan structure appears to vary across regions, but always includes 1-5 breeding females and their subadult offspring. In the central Kalahari, groups often also include at least one adult resident immigrant male. Mean clan size in the southern Kalahari was 3-7 adults and subadults, and total clan size ranged from 4-14. In the central Kalahari, a well-studied clan contained 13 members including cubs. Because adult females and their offspring are the core of a social group, the majority of clan members are related. However, dispersal from and immigration into the clan occurs. Although subadults of both sexes may disperse from their natal clan, males do so more often than females and most males disperse by 36-40 months of age. In two reported cases of female emigration in the central Kalahari, the number of resident adult females was atits zenith (five) and the dispersing females both were targets of severe aggression from other resident females prior to dispersal. In both cases, dispersal appeared to be prompted by conflicts with established adults of the same sex. The central Kalahari and southern Kalahari locales also apparently differ with respect to clan social hierarchies. In the central Kalahari a linear within-sex dominance hierarchy was apparent, and at carcasses with more than one hyena, rank determined priority of access to food. Although immigrant males were dominantto all natal males, the highest ranking male and female appeared to be of equal status. Adult females were typically dominant to natal males of less than 36 months of age. These natal males were tolerated until about 24 months, when aggression gradually increased until their dispersal. However, in one case, a natal male remained in the clan and eventually dominated the clan females. In the southern Kalahari no dominance hierarchy was apparent, with no sex, age-class, or individual consistently winning fights or monopolizing food resources in clans. Differences in the breeding systems and the existence or lack of a hierarchy are thought to be related to significant differences in Brown Hyena density in the two locales. In the central Kalahari, 37-81% of observations involve the association of two or more hyenas. In the southern Kalahari contact between group members appears to be less frequent. Although there is typically aggression between hyenas of the same sex from different groups when they meet, the level of aggression within clans appears to vary between the southern and central Kalahari. In the central Kalahari, neck-biting appears to be used to maintain rank relationships within the clan and is observed with some frequency, while in the southern Kalahari, fighting within the clan is rare, with clan members seldom interacting at all. Here, the only aggression observed is between same-sex members of neighboring clans, and this is extremely infrequent. Interestingly, in the southern Kalahari, where resident males do not breed with clan females, these males show little aggression to nomadic males, who are responsible for mating with groupliving females, suggesting that Brown Hyenas can differentiate between neighboring males and nomadic males. When they meet after being separated, Brown Hyenas from the same group engage in a greeting ceremony in which each animal in turn crouches and presents its extruded anal pouch to the other. This is accompanied by a lowering of the ears and a “grin” (teeth exposed by pulling lips up and corners of the mouth back) by the subordinate animal whenit is greeting a dominant. Greetings can last as long as five minutes. Two additional behaviors that appear to be important in Brown Hyena society are neck-biting and muzzle-wrestling. Neck-biting is a purely agonistic interaction (though cubs may engage in it during play) and is primarily intrasexual. In the southern Kalahari, this behavioris largely restricted to interactions between members of neighboring clans, whereas in the central Kalahari, it can be seen more frequently between clan members and is thought to function in maintenance of a dominance hierarchy. Neck-biting behavioris a ritualized, somewhat elaborate interaction in which dominant and subordinate animals are clear from the start. The submissive animal approaches a standing dominant individual grinning and with its mane and tail raised. Either before or at its approach, the dominant seizes the neck of the subordinate, holding the skin and hair of the neck with its incisors and one or both canines, and vigorously shakes the victim from side to side. This type of interaction typically lasts less than five minutes, and only rarely does the subordinate flee at its conclusion. Muzzle wresting may be observed anywhere in the territory and is exhibited by all clan members. However, adults rarely engage in this behavior with other adults, though they will do so with cubs with some frequency. Most muzzle-wrestling occurs between cubs and subadults. The two participants stand face to face, and attemptto bite each other on the jowls or along the side of face. Their heads pitch rapidly from side to side with mouths open, and they often growl softly throughout. One or both hyenas may be crouched on their carpals, and in some cases one may lie beneath the other. This behavior is clearly less aggressive than neck biting and may often be play, although it can escalate into true aggression. There is no clear loser, and animals typically remain with each other after muzzle-wrestling, which may last from a few minutes to an hour. The most striking visual display of the Brown Hyena is pilo-erection of the long hairs along its neck and back, which is observed in situations calling for either an attack or flight response. Despite its rather elaborate social interactions, Brown Hyenas spend the vast majority of their time alone, and the primary form of communication between hyenas is olfactory. They convey information to conspecifics with latrines, which have accumulations of feces, and grass stalks on which they have deposited a strong-smelling white secretion and a smaller black secretion. Both secretions are deposited during pasting from an extruded anal scent pouch located between the rectum and base ofthe tail. Although all four hyaenid species paste, the deposition of two different secretionsis unique to Brown Hyenas. Whereas the lipid-rich white secretion is discernible to the human nose for well over 30 days, the more watery black secretion appears unscented after a few hours. This black secretion is thought to convey information relating to the time elapsed since it was deposited, and therefore signal that a hyena has recently foraged in the area. It is suggested that this allows other group members to avoid unproductive areas, and minimizes competition between group members for limited resources. The longer-lasting white secretion is thought to function in territory marking and defense. Pasting is done throughout a clan’s territory. Although most pasting occurs in the central part of the territory, where residents spend most of their time, frequency of pasting and over-pasting (deposition on an existing mark) is highest when individuals visit territory boundaries. Very little pasting is done by residents when they are outside of their territory. Pasting during traveling/foraging movements can be quite frequent, with ten individuals averaging a paste every six minutes. However,this is highly variable, with some individuals pasting only once or twice during a night-time observation period. Males and females do not differ in rate of pasting during their travels. At the den, adults and subadults frequently paste soon after arriving and before departing. At least in the southern Kalahari, the perimeter of hyena territories is thought to be too large to make strict border marking possible or effective. Instead, marks are scattered throughout the residents’ territory. This is known as hinterland marking. Given the frequency of pasting, and how widely pastes are deposited across a territory, simulations indicate that in the southern Kalahari, hinterland marking is effective. Intruders would likely encounter resident paste marks very soon after entering a territory. Indeed, individual hyenas are estimated to deposit some 29,000 paste marks in a year. Experiments with translocated pasted grass stalks indicate that hyenas can distinguish between pastes of group and non-group members and that over-pasting is more commonly done on pastings from non-group hyenas. Chemical analysis of white and black paste suggests that the scent of these substances probably varies between individuals, allowing for identification of the paster. In the southern Kalahari, latrines are not as regularly spaced as pastings, and show a clumped distribution, largely around primary foraging areas that occur along the territory border. Latrines are often associated with landmarks such as trees, bushes or roads, and those along the border are visited more frequently than those in the interior. The vocal repertoire of the Brown Hyena is relatively small, as in the Striped Hyena, and consists of eight vocalizations: a yell, a hoot, two whines and four growls, none of which functions as a longdistance communication. Some authors group these into five calls, the squeal/whine, squeak, scream,yell, and growl/grunt. The squeal is a shrill sharp cry emitted by a juvenile or other subordinate while approaching to greet or beg food from a dominant individual. The squeak is a hoarse rasping cry of abject submission associated with carpal crawling. A scream is a high-pitched, cackling shriek given by a hyena whose neck is being bitten. The yell is a loud, abrupt high-pitched call associated with defensive threat. A growl/grunt is low-pitched, breathless and throaty, and is given while muzzle-wrestling. All but the growl appear to indicate submission or appeasement in social contexts of varying intensity.",,"Primarily a nocturnal animal, although activity is occasionally observed during the day, particularly on cool, cloudy days during the rainy season.

All but the growl appear to indicate submission or appeasement in social contexts of varying intensity. Breeding. Brown Hyenas are polyestrous, non-seasonal breeders. Litters range from 1-4 cubs with a modallitter size of three. Estrus lasts approximately one week but mating in captivity occurs over a 15day period. Based on six observed mating bouts in the southern Kalahari, mating associations consist of multiple copulation attempts over a 5-90 minute period, and may be preceded by extended courtship, during which both animals may show aggression and there are mutual approaches and retreats. Gestation in captivity was 96 days. Interbirth intervals appear to range widely. In the southern Kalahari they were as short as a year and as long as 41 months apart, although lost litters in the interim could not be ruled out. Cubs are born with their eyes closed and their ears bent forward. Their fur is similar in color to that of adults. Their eyes begin to open at eight days and are completely open at 14 days. Unlike Spotted Hyenas, Brown Hyena cubs are born without teeth. As in the other bone-cracking hyaenids, den dependenceis long and weaning occurs late. Cubs from 0-3 months of age rarely leave the den hole except when their mother or another adult is present. During this period, mothers attend the den frequently, often at sunrise and sunset and cubs rely completely on their mother’s milk. At four months, visits by the mother become less frequent, with mothers visiting about once a night, but suckling periods are longer. At this time, mothers and other group members begin bringing food to the den for the cubs. Weaning normally occurs at 12-16 months of age, yet weaning conflicts have been observed at ten months. Starting at ten months, cubs begin extensive, and very often solitary, foraging movements away from the den. Length of den residence is variable however, ranging from 8-15 months. Regardless of their dependence on the den, by 16 months weaning has occurred and full adult dentition is present. As they mature, subadults themselves begin to bring food back to the den for younger cubs. This has been observed in subadults as young as 22 months. Adult size is reached at 30 months. The earliest breeding recorded in the wild is 35 months; breeding continues until at least ten years of age. Cubs are raised in underground, sometimes extensive, tunnels, always small enough to prevent adults and potential predators from entering. They are easily distinguished by accumulations of bones, hair, feathers, horns, pieces of hide, and hyena feces. In the southern Kalahari Brown Hyena dens appear to be used only rarely by multiple females at once, and cubs are typically raised in the same den in which they are born. However, communal denning appears to be common in the central Kalahari, with cubs of multiple females, and of different ages, raised together at a single den location. In this system, cubs are born in a solitary den and transported to the communal den sometime before they are four months of age. Throughout their development, den moves are common and cubs may reside at as many as seven different dens, though distances between dens are typically not large. In the central Kalahari, where a social rank system is evident, dominant females enjoy greater reproductive success in terms of number of surviving offspring, yet the number oflitters does not vary based on rank. There appears to be variation, both regionally and temporally, in the mating system of Brown Hyenas. In one system, females breed only with nomadic males that range over wide areas without defended territories or family groups. In the other, females breed not only with nomadic males but with resident immigrant males as well. These residents are members of the clan and assist in territory defense, yet their tenure, at least in the central Kalahari, is relatively short (less than three years). In this area, where both nomadic males and resident immigrant males are present, dominant clan males were observed to copulate with resident females more frequently than nomadic males. In the southern Kalahari, the only mating observed involved nomadic males, and no resident males, either immigrant or natal, were observed to mate. Although males known to be natal showed little sexual interest at all in any resident females, researchers were unable to observe immigrant males long enough to ascertain sexual interest in resident females. The source of the variation in the mating system of Brown Hyenas is unclear, although it may be related to dispersion of food. In the central Kalahari, where both systems were observed over time, mating with nomadic males was restricted to the dry season, when resident clan males would likely have difficulty maintaining contact with clan females (some were separated by 22 km ). Because territories are very large in the southern Kalahari and only breeding with nomadic malesis seen, the food dispersion theory is further supported. Individual reproductive patterns in males are also likely to be influenced by individual status and the behavior of other males in the population. In either case, natal males are never observed to mate with females in their natal clan. Communal care of cubs is better developed among Brown Hyenas than in any of the other three hyaenid species. Non-parental aid in cub rearing includes communal suckling (although preference in nursing one’s own cubs has been shown), food provisioning, den maintenance, defense against predators, play, and adoption of orphans. Subadult and adult females ofall social ranks and reproductive states bring food items to the den for cubs. However, the extent of involvement in provisioning by adult males seems to vary by region. In the central Kalahari, subadult males provision cubs, but to a lesser degree than females, and they only bring food to closely related cubs. Neither immigrant nor natal adult males were seen provisioning cubs. It has been suggested thatthis is because males do not benefit from an increased group size, as they are likely to emigrate from their natal clan. In the southern Kalahari, however, group-living males and females, both adult and subadult, were observed to provision cubs regularly. Average distance in this population from which food was carried back to the den was 6-4 km.","Listed as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List.

Brown Hyena Parahyaena brunnea French: Hyene brune / German: Braune Hyane / Spanish: Hiena parda Taxonomy. Hyaena brunnea Thunberg, 1820 , South Africa , Western Cape Province , Cape of Good Hope. Formerly classified as Hyaena brunnea , but a recent molecular analysis assigns this species to a separate genus from that of the Striped Hyena. Along with Striped and Spotted Hyenas, the Brown Hyena belongs to the subfamily Hyaeninae . Monotypic. Distribution. Namibia , Botswana , W & S Zimbabwe , S Mozambique , Swaziland , W Lesotho , and South Africa . Records from the SW of Angola are all before 1970. Descriptive notes. Head-body 110-136 cm; average 123 cm (males), 117 cm (females), tail 18.7-26. 5 cm , average height at shoulders 79 cm (males) and 74 cm (females); weight (adult) varies somewhat regionally, ranges from 28 to 47-5 kg and averages about 40 kg . Most studies show some sexual size dimorphism, but it is often minimal, with males slightly heavier and longer than females. Has a typical hyena appearance with front legs longer and more robust than the rear legs, a broad head and short muzzle, thick neck and short tail. Like the Striped Hyena it has large pointed ears and course shaggy fur that is longest along the back and on the tail. The general color is dark brown with lighter tawny hair on the neck and shoulders. The legs are banded with dark horizontalstripes and the front feet are large and well-developed for digging. Like the Spotted and Striped Hyenas, the Brown Hyena possesses the bonecrushing third premolar that is unique to this family. In contrast to Spotted Hyenas, there is no masculinization of the female genitalia in Brown Hyenas. Females have two to six pairs ofteats, but only the two most caudal pairs are functional. Habitat. Brown Hyenas are found in a variety of relatively arid habitats from open desert or semi-desert in the Namib and Kalahari, to dry open scrub and woodland savannah, mopani scrub and tree savannah, as well as the bushveld of the northern Transvaal. They do not need drinking water and inhabit areas where annual rainfall may be even lower than 100 mm , up to about 650 mm . Food and Feeding. These hyenas forage alone at night and do not cooperate in hunting or in feeding, although group members tolerate each other at large food items. Although not competent hunters, Brown Hyenas are extremely efficient scavengers with an omnivorous diet. They are opportunistic feeders on a range of vertebrates, primarily mammals, the vast majority of which are scavenged, often from the kills of other carnivores. Fruits, insects and reptiles can be important supplementary foods when carcasses are rare. In one population 58 different food items were identified from fecal analysis. Brown Hyenas in the southern Kalahari spent 30% of their feeding time eating carrion, 28% on vegetable matter, 4-5% on small mammals, 1-5% on birds’ eggs, and 29% on unknown items. Only 5-8% of food they were seen eating was killed by the hyenas themselves. In the central Kalahari 35-9% ofall observed feeding bouts were on fresh scavenged kills, 33-9% on old carcasses, 16% on their own kills, and 12:5% on vegetative food sources. Brown Hyenas do not depend on standing water. In the central Kalahari, no free water orrain is typically found for eight months of the year. Although they will drink on a daily basis when water is present, much of the water during dry seasons is obtained from Cucurbitaceae fruits such as the tsama melon, gemsbok cucumber, and Hookeri melon, which can compose significant proportions of the diet in these seasons. Brown Hyenas inhabiting the Namibian coast feed almost exclusively on subadult Brown Fur Seals. The majority of these seals are thought to be scavenged, although Brown Hyenas have been seen hunting seal pups. In fact, hunting efficiency on seal pups during the peak pupping season can be as high as 47%, and an average of almost five seals per day may be killed from a single colony. Small rodents and seabirds make up the rest of this unique diet. Elsewhere hunting attempts by Brown Hyenas are opportunistic and directed at small mammals such as Springbok lambs, spring hares, Bat-eared Foxes, and ground nesting birds. The hunting technique of the Brown Hyena is unspecialized, rarely successful (except in the case of Brown Fur Seal pups), and may include a brief lunge at a surprised prey, a prolonged chase of up 1 km , or an attempt to dig up a burrowed animal. The percent of observed hunting attempts that were successful was 4:7% in the southern Kalahari and 13-7% in the central Kalahari. The hyenas generally feed where they find food, but food from larger carcasses is frequently cached nearby in a clump of grass or under a bush. Considerable time is often spent at carcasses removing limbs for this purpose and one animal may remove and cache up to three legs before any competitors arrive. Sites where food is cached are scent-marked and may be re-visited over multiple days. In a remarkable example of food caching in the southern Kalahari, a Brown Hyena arrived at an abandoned ostrich (Struthio camelus) nest with 26 eggs , which are prized food items. The hyena spent four hours carrying 14 eggs distances of 150-600 m from the nest, some of which it simply dropped in the open. It ate only three eggs during this period. Brown Hyenas also carry food back to cubs at the den. This provisioning of cubs can result in significant bone accumulations at densites. In the southern Kalahari the average distance moved between significant meals was 7-2 km, and the average nightly distance traveled was 31-1 km. During the dry season, nightly movements were longer and were recorded as high as 54-4 km. During the wet season movements were reduced and ranged from 10-20 km. In Namibia , daily distances traveled ranged from 15-47 km. When foraging, Brown Hyenas move at a pace of about 4 km /h, often walking in a zig-zag pattern, probably to maximize their chance of coming across food items. They use smell to locate much of their food, as evidenced by frequent sniffing and moving upwind toward food sources. Their hearing appears to be acute as well and is likely also used in foraging. The Brown Hyena is subordinate at kills to Spotted Hyenas, Lions and African Wild Dogs, although it appears to dominate Leopards in most situations. While they always dominate Cheetahs, they compete heavily with the much smaller Black-backed Jackal, which is often able to steal scraps from hyenas at carcasses. There is some evidence that, where they are sympatric, Brown Hyenas avoid areas frequented by Spotted Hyenas, potentially to avoid direct aggression and competition. For example, dens in the southern Kalahari were rarely found in the prey-rich riverine habitat where most Spotted Hyena dens occurred. Although their presence at livestock carcasses has resulted in much antagonism toward, and persecution of, Brown Hyenas by livestock owners, predation on livestock by these animals appears to be done by a small number of individuals. However, these hyenas, which typically target cow calves and sheep, can account for a large number of kills. Removal of these problem individuals appears effective at halting stock losses. Activity patterns. Primarily a nocturnal animal, although activity is occasionally observed during the day, particularly on cool, cloudy days during the rainy season. There are typcally two peaks of activity, from 19:30 h to 24:00 h and 2:30 h to 6:00 h, with a rest period in between. Radio-collared adults in the southern Kalahari were active for 42.6% of the 24 h period, and 80.2% of the period between 18:00 h and 06:00 h. In Namibia , three males with satellite collars spent an average of 57-1-72-3% of 24 h active. Brown Hyenas typically rest during the day in a hole, or undera large tree or bush. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Approximately 65% of Brown Hyenas in a population are members of small social groups called clans, with the remaining individuals living as nomads. Clan size ranges from 4-14 individuals, including cubs, and clans defend large stable territories. In the southern Kalahari far-ranging nomadic males (8% of the adult population) were the only males observed to breed with clan-living females, yet in the central Kalahari, breeding also occurs with resident immigrant males. In the southern Kalahari territories averaged 308 km ? (range: 215-461 km?) with never more than 20% overlap between territories. Brown Hyena density there was calculated to be 1-8 hyenas/ 100 km ?®. In the central Kalahari territories averaged 170 km ?, but varied greatly with annualrainfall, reaching a maximum of 400 km ?. In Namibia , where Brown Hyenas depend almost entirely on Brown Fur Seals along the coast, territories of two clans in one study were 31-9 km? and 220 km ? In another study the home ranges of three males ranged from 420-1460 km? with the largest home range being an inland location. Density in this latter Namibian study ranged from 1-0-2-9/ 100 km ®. In general, group size appears to be correlated with food abundance and quality within the territory, whereas territory size is influenced by the distribution of food resources. Territories are maintained primarily through scent marking behavior (called “pasting”) and aggression toward intruders. Clan structure appears to vary across regions, but always includes 1-5 breeding females and their subadult offspring. In the central Kalahari, groups often also include at least one adult resident immigrant male. Mean clan size in the southern Kalahari was 3-7 adults and subadults, and total clan size ranged from 4-14. In the central Kalahari, a well-studied clan contained 13 members including cubs. Because adult females and their offspring are the core of a social group, the majority of clan members are related. However, dispersal from and immigration into the clan occurs. Although subadults of both sexes may disperse from their natal clan, males do so more often than females and most males disperse by 36-40 months of age. In two reported cases of female emigration in the central Kalahari, the number of resident adult females was atits zenith (five) and the dispersing females both were targets of severe aggression from other resident females prior to dispersal. In both cases, dispersal appeared to be prompted by conflicts with established adults of the same sex. The central Kalahari and southern Kalahari locales also apparently differ with respect to clan social hierarchies. In the central Kalahari a linear within-sex dominance hierarchy was apparent, and at carcasses with more than one hyena, rank determined priority of access to food. Although immigrant males were dominantto all natal males, the highest ranking male and female appeared to be of equal status. Adult females were typically dominant to natal males of less than 36 months of age. These natal males were tolerated until about 24 months, when aggression gradually increased until their dispersal. However, in one case, a natal male remained in the clan and eventually dominated the clan females. In the southern Kalahari no dominance hierarchy was apparent, with no sex, age-class, or individual consistently winning fights or monopolizing food resources in clans. Differences in the breeding systems and the existence or lack of a hierarchy are thought to be related to significant differences in Brown Hyena density in the two locales. In the central Kalahari, 37-81% of observations involve the association of two or more hyenas. In the southern Kalahari contact between group members appears to be less frequent. Although there is typically aggression between hyenas of the same sex from different groups when they meet, the level of aggression within clans appears to vary between the southern and central Kalahari. In the central Kalahari, neck-biting appears to be used to maintain rank relationships within the clan and is observed with some frequency, while in the southern Kalahari, fighting within the clan is rare, with clan members seldom interacting at all. Here, the only aggression observed is between same-sex members of neighboring clans, and this is extremely infrequent. Interestingly, in the southern Kalahari, where resident males do not breed with clan females, these males show little aggression to nomadic males, who are responsible for mating with groupliving females, suggesting that Brown Hyenas can differentiate between neighboring males and nomadic males. When they meet after being separated, Brown Hyenas from the same group engage in a greeting ceremony in which each animal in turn crouches and presents its extruded anal pouch to the other. This is accompanied by a lowering of the ears and a “grin” (teeth exposed by pulling lips up and corners of the mouth back) by the subordinate animal whenit is greeting a dominant. Greetings can last as long as five minutes. Two additional behaviors that appear to be important in Brown Hyena society are neck-biting and muzzle-wrestling. Neck-biting is a purely agonistic interaction (though cubs may engage in it during play) and is primarily intrasexual. In the southern Kalahari, this behavioris largely restricted to interactions between members of neighboring clans, whereas in the central Kalahari, it can be seen more frequently between clan members and is thought to function in maintenance of a dominance hierarchy. Neck-biting behavioris a ritualized, somewhat elaborate interaction in which dominant and subordinate animals are clear from the start. The submissive animal approaches a standing dominant individual grinning and with its mane and tail raised. Either before or at its approach, the dominant seizes the neck of the subordinate, holding the skin and hair of the neck with its incisors and one or both canines, and vigorously shakes the victim from side to side. This type of interaction typically lasts less than five minutes, and only rarely does the subordinate flee at its conclusion. Muzzle wresting may be observed anywhere in the territory and is exhibited by all clan members. However, adults rarely engage in this behavior with other adults, though they will do so with cubs with some frequency. Most muzzle-wrestling occurs between cubs and subadults. The two participants stand face to face, and attemptto bite each other on the jowls or along the side of face. Their heads pitch rapidly from side to side with mouths open, and they often growl softly throughout. One or both hyenas may be crouched on their carpals, and in some cases one may lie beneath the other. This behavior is clearly less aggressive than neck biting and may often be play, although it can escalate into true aggression. There is no clear loser, and animals typically remain with each other after muzzle-wrestling, which may last from a few minutes to an hour. The most striking visual display of the Brown Hyena is pilo-erection of the long hairs along its neck and back, which is observed in situations calling for either an attack or flight response. Despite its rather elaborate social interactions, Brown Hyenas spend the vast majority of their time alone, and the primary form of communication between hyenas is olfactory. They convey information to conspecifics with latrines, which have accumulations of feces, and grass stalks on which they have deposited a strong-smelling white secretion and a smaller black secretion. Both secretions are deposited during pasting from an extruded anal scent pouch located between the rectum and base ofthe tail. Although all four hyaenid species paste, the deposition of two different secretionsis unique to Brown Hyenas. Whereas the lipid-rich white secretion is discernible to the human nose for well over 30 days, the more watery black secretion appears unscented after a few hours. This black secretion is thought to convey information relating to the time elapsed since it was deposited, and therefore signal that a hyena has recently foraged in the area. It is suggested that this allows other group members to avoid unproductive areas, and minimizes competition between group members for limited resources. The longer-lasting white secretion is thought to function in territory marking and defense. Pasting is done throughout a clan’s territory. Although most pasting occurs in the central part of the territory, where residents spend most of their time, frequency of pasting and over-pasting (deposition on an existing mark) is highest when individuals visit territory boundaries. Very little pasting is done by residents when they are outside of their territory. Pasting during traveling/foraging movements can be quite frequent, with ten individuals averaging a paste every six minutes. However,this is highly variable, with some individuals pasting only once or twice during a night-time observation period. Males and females do not differ in rate of pasting during their travels. At the den, adults and subadults frequently paste soon after arriving and before departing. At least in the southern Kalahari, the perimeter of hyena territories is thought to be too large to make strict border marking possible or effective. Instead, marks are scattered throughout the residents’ territory. This is known as hinterland marking. Given the frequency of pasting, and how widely pastes are deposited across a territory, simulations indicate that in the southern Kalahari, hinterland marking is effective. Intruders would likely encounter resident paste marks very soon after entering a territory. Indeed, individual hyenas are estimated to deposit some 29,000 paste marks in a year. Experiments with translocated pasted grass stalks indicate that hyenas can distinguish between pastes of group and non-group members and that over-pasting is more commonly done on pastings from non-group hyenas. Chemical analysis of white and black paste suggests that the scent of these substances probably varies between individuals, allowing for identification of the paster. In the southern Kalahari, latrines are not as regularly spaced as pastings, and show a clumped distribution, largely around primary foraging areas that occur along the territory border. Latrines are often associated with landmarks such as trees, bushes or roads, and those along the border are visited more frequently than those in the interior. The vocal repertoire of the Brown Hyena is relatively small, as in the Striped Hyena, and consists of eight vocalizations: a yell, a hoot, two whines and four growls, none of which functions as a longdistance communication. Some authors group these into five calls, the squeal/whine, squeak, scream,yell, and growl/grunt. The squeal is a shrill sharp cry emitted by a juvenile or other subordinate while approaching to greet or beg food from a dominant individual. The squeak is a hoarse rasping cry of abject submission associated with carpal crawling. A scream is a high-pitched, cackling shriek given by a hyena whose neck is being bitten. The yell is a loud, abrupt high-pitched call associated with defensive threat. A growl/grunt is low-pitched, breathless and throaty, and is given while muzzle-wrestling. All but the growl appear to indicate submission or appeasement in social contexts of varying intensity. Breeding. Brown Hyenas are polyestrous, non-seasonal breeders. Litters range from 1-4 cubs with a modallitter size of three. Estrus lasts approximately one week but mating in captivity occurs over a 15day period. Based on six observed mating bouts in the southern Kalahari, mating associations consist of multiple copulation attempts over a 5-90 minute period, and may be preceded by extended courtship, during which both animals may show aggression and there are mutual approaches and retreats. Gestation in captivity was 96 days. Interbirth intervals appear to range widely. In the southern Kalahari they were as short as a year and as long as 41 months apart, although lost litters in the interim could not be ruled out. Cubs are born with their eyes closed and their ears bent forward. Their fur is similar in color to that of adults. Their eyes begin to open at eight days and are completely open at 14 days. Unlike Spotted Hyenas, Brown Hyena cubs are born without teeth. As in the other bone-cracking hyaenids, den dependenceis long and weaning occurs late. Cubs from 0-3 months of age rarely leave the den hole except when their mother or another adult is present. During this period, mothers attend the den frequently, often at sunrise and sunset and cubs rely completely on their mother’s milk. At four months, visits by the mother become less frequent, with mothers visiting about once a night, but suckling periods are longer. At this time, mothers and other group members begin bringing food to the den for the cubs. Weaning normally occurs at 12-16 months of age, yet weaning conflicts have been observed at ten months. Starting at ten months, cubs begin extensive, and very often solitary, foraging movements away from the den. Length of den residence is variable however, ranging from 8-15 months. Regardless of their dependence on the den, by 16 months weaning has occurred and full adult dentition is present. As they mature, subadults themselves begin to bring food back to the den for younger cubs. This has been observed in subadults as young as 22 months. Adult size is reached at 30 months. The earliest breeding recorded in the wild is 35 months; breeding continues until at least ten years of age. Cubs are raised in underground, sometimes extensive, tunnels, always small enough to prevent adults and potential predators from entering. They are easily distinguished by accumulations of bones, hair, feathers, horns, pieces of hide, and hyena feces. In the southern Kalahari Brown Hyena dens appear to be used only rarely by multiple females at once, and cubs are typically raised in the same den in which they are born. However, communal denning appears to be common in the central Kalahari, with cubs of multiple females, and of different ages, raised together at a single den location. In this system, cubs are born in a solitary den and transported to the communal den sometime before they are four months of age. Throughout their development, den moves are common and cubs may reside at as many as seven different dens, though distances between dens are typically not large. In the central Kalahari, where a social rank system is evident, dominant females enjoy greater reproductive success in terms of number of surviving offspring, yet the number oflitters does not vary based on rank. There appears to be variation, both regionally and temporally, in the mating system of Brown Hyenas. In one system, females breed only with nomadic males that range over wide areas without defended territories or family groups. In the other, females breed not only with nomadic males but with resident immigrant males as well. These residents are members of the clan and assist in territory defense, yet their tenure, at least in the central Kalahari, is relatively short (less than three years). In this area, where both nomadic males and resident immigrant males are present, dominant clan males were observed to copulate with resident females more frequently than nomadic males. In the southern Kalahari, the only mating observed involved nomadic males, and no resident males, either immigrant or natal, were observed to mate. Although males known to be natal showed little sexual interest at all in any resident females, researchers were unable to observe immigrant males long enough to ascertain sexual interest in resident females. The source of the variation in the mating system of Brown Hyenas is unclear, although it may be related to dispersion of food. In the central Kalahari, where both systems were observed over time, mating with nomadic males was restricted to the dry season, when resident clan males would likely have difficulty maintaining contact with clan females (some were separated by 22 km ). Because territories are very large in the southern Kalahari and only breeding with nomadic malesis seen, the food dispersion theory is further supported. Individual reproductive patterns in males are also likely to be influenced by individual status and the behavior of other males in the population. In either case, natal males are never observed to mate with females in their natal clan. Communal care of cubs is better developed among Brown Hyenas than in any of the other three hyaenid species. Non-parental aid in cub rearing includes communal suckling (although preference in nursing one’s own cubs has been shown), food provisioning, den maintenance, defense against predators, play, and adoption of orphans. Subadult and adult females ofall social ranks and reproductive states bring food items to the den for cubs. However, the extent of involvement in provisioning by adult males seems to vary by region. In the central Kalahari, subadult males provision cubs, but to a lesser degree than females, and they only bring food to closely related cubs. Neither immigrant nor natal adult males were seen provisioning cubs. It has been suggested thatthis is because males do not benefit from an increased group size, as they are likely to emigrate from their natal clan. In the southern Kalahari, however, group-living males and females, both adult and subadult, were observed to provision cubs regularly. Average distance in this population from which food was carried back to the den was 6-4 km. Status and Conservation. Listed as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List.

Of the extant hyaenids, the Striped Hyena is most closely related to the Brown Hyena, and its lifestyle, reproduction, and social behavior more closely resemble those of Brown Hyenas than those of Spotted Hyenas or Aardwolves. Some authorities provisionally recognize five subspecies, distinguished mainly by differences in size and pelage ( hyaena from India , barbara from NW Africa, dubbah from NE Africa, sultana from the Arabian Peninsula, and syriaca from Syria , Asia Minor and the Caucasus). However, other authorities argue that current morphological data and other evidence do not support multiple subspecies.","The Striped Hyena has a very large range, covering much of Africa and western Asia. Although they do not occur in the central Sahara, these animals occur at low density in patches throughout eastern, western and northern Africa, including Algeria , Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Libya , Mali , Nigeria , Mauritania , Morocco , Niger , Senegal , Tanzania , and Tunisia . Striped Hyenas also occur in the Middle East and Central Asia. Middle Eastern and Asian countries included in the modern distribution of the Striped Hyena are Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , India , Iran , Iraq , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Nepal , Oman , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Tajikistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Yemen . The current distribution of this species is patchy, and usually appears to occur in small, isolated populations.","The Striped Hyena is the smallest of the three bone-cracking hyaenids, but is substantially larger than the Aardwolf. Head-body 100-115 cm,tail 30-40 cm, shoulder height between 66-75 cm; weight 26-41 kg (males) and 26-34 kg (females). Among the provisional subspecies, body mass and body size are only well studied in syriaca in Israel and dubbah in Kenya . In these populations, there was no significant sexual dimorphism in body size. However, in one recent study in Israel , sexual dimorphism accounted for 39% of the variation in adult body size. Like the other hyaenids, the Striped Hyena has a sloping back because the forelegs are longer than the hindlegs, and has well-developed anal glands used for scent marking. Large ducts from the anal glands open into an anal pouch dorsal to the anus. As in the other bonecracking Hyenas, the head, neck, and shoulders are relatively massive and powerful. The fur is pale gray or straw-colored, with black vertical stripes on the sides of the body. Like the Brown Hyena, the Striped Hyena has longer fur than the Spotted Hyena, giving it a rather shaggy appearance. The Striped Hyena has a black muzzle and a black patch on the throat. It has five to nine vertical stripes on the flanks, two cheek stripes, and clear black transverse and horizontal stripes on all four legs. The head is roundish with a pointed muzzle and long, pointed ears. It has a gray or blond mane that runs along its dorsal midline from the ears to the tail; the mane can be erected to increase the animal’s apparentsize by over 30%. The mane in this species is more pronounced than that in any other hyaenid, with hairs up to 20 cm long. The black and white tail is long and bushy, with hair that is generally coarse and long. Females have two or three pairs of teats, but if they have three, only the caudal two pairs are functional. Juvenile females have well-defined labia-like folds anterior to the vagina. These ridges are hairless and darker and rougher than the surrounding tissue. Juvenile males have smaller, smooth, hairless skin folds along the middle septum close to, but anterior to, the scrotum. Unlike Spotted Hyenas, these genital characteristics are not severe enough to confuse sexing of juveniles, and adult genitalia appear normal. Subspecies descriptions are based on limited data except for syriaca in Israel and dubbah in Kenya . In general animals living in the northern parts of the range tend to be slightly larger than those living in southern regions. Variation in pelage color appearsslight, although the Lebanese population is reported to have a reddish coat color, and hyenas on the Arabian Peninsula are described as having a yellow mark below the eyes and a mixed gray and black dorsal crest.","In most ofits range the Striped Hyena occurs in rugged, arid habitat or light thorn bush country. These animals drink regularly where wateris available, but they can also survive in many waterless areas. In North Africa they prefer open woodlands and bushy and mountainous regions. The central Arabian and Sahara Deserts are not suitable habitat. In central Asia, Striped Hyenas avoid high altitudes and dense thickets and forests. The maximum elevations recorded are 2250 m in Iran , 2500 m in India and 3300 m in Pakistan . In the Caucasus region, Turkmenistan , Tadzhikistan , and Uzbekistan , prime habitats include savannah and semi-desert regions up to an elevation of 2100 m , mountain areas with strong relief, valleys with abundant caves or other resting sites, and riverine areas. The Striped Hyena avoids areas with minimum temperatures ofless than —15°C to —20°C and more than 80-120 days offrost per year. In Israel , Striped Hyenas are present even close to dense human settlements. In West Africa, they occur in dry scrub savanna and Sahel woodland, particularly in the belt of Acacia raddiana woodland that extends from Senegal to Chad . In eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are found in a variety of habitats ranging from open savanna to rugged, bush-covered mountain terrain.","The diet of Striped Hyenas apparently varies considerably from one part of their range to another, but these animals are clearly scavengers with catholic tastes. They are primarily carrion-eaters; their diet consists mainly of dried flesh and bones from carcasses of large vertebrates. They scavenge carrion and the remains of kills made by other predators, including Spotted Hyenas, Cheetahs, Leopards, Lions, and Tigers. The Hyena’s massive cheek teeth and supporting musculature easily permit the gnawing and breaking of bones, as well as the carapaces of tortoises and turtles. Striped Hyenas have also been reported to consume a wide variety of invertebrates, vegetables, fruit, garbage, and small vertebrates that the Hyenas hunt themselves. In central Kenya , analysis of bone fragments and hairs from fecal samples indicated that hyenas regularly consume small mammals and birds that are unlikely to be scavenged. The limited available diet data may underestimate the importance of active hunting in the lives of these animals. In various parts of eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are reported to supplement their diet with Balanites fruits. The proportion of scavenged and killed prey items in the diet is still a matter of debate as there has been no detailed research on these Hyenas’ food intake. Some authors suggest that only individuals from the three larger subspecies, barbara, syriaca and hyaena , kill large prey, including livestock,as there is no evidence that the smaller subspecies, dubbah and sultana, attack large herbivores. In Turkmenistan the Striped Hyena has been reported feeding on Wild Boar, Kulan, porcupine, and particularly tortoises. In Uzbekhistan and Tadzhikistan , seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits (Eleagnus angustifolia) is reflected in the diet; in the Caucasus region the diet includes abundant grasshoppers. In Israel the Striped Hyena feeds on garbage, carrion, and fruits, particularly dates and melons. In eastern Jordan , the main sources of food are carcasses of feral horses and water buffalo and refuse from localvillages. The Striped Hyena can drink water of very variable quality, from fresh water to soda and salt water, but it may also satisfy its water requirements with melons or otherfruits. Very little is currently known about the hunting behavior of Striped Hyenas, but those few hunts that have been observed involved simple chases and grabs at prey. Seasonal influxes of Striped Hyenas follow migrations of large herds of domestic and wild ungulates in Turkmenistan , suggesting that the Hyenas cover long distances on foraging trips. In Egypt they are known to move along ancient caravan roads where the chance of locating dead camels is high. In Serengeti and in southern Kenya , they spend most of the night actively searching for food or moving between established foraging sites. Striped Hyenas apparently can remember the locations offruiting trees, garbage dumps and other established feeding sites, although the routes taken to re-visit such food sources are seldom repeated on consecutive foraging trips. They are also able to locate tortoises in their hiding places during periods of aestivation and hibernation. Striped Hyenas frequently cache bones or pieces of skin, using their snouts to push these items deep into clumps of grass or stands of dense shrubs. They may also carry food items back to their dens. Bone collections are common at den sites used by Striped Hyenas, although it is often unclear whether these collections represent scavenged or killed prey, and whether the bones collected play a significant nutritional role in the lives of these animals. Several studies have inferred diet by combining data from bone collections and fecal samples. In central Kenya , however, bone collections indicated a much broader range of prey than did scat analysis, and significant portions of bone assemblages were very old bones unlikely to represent material scavenged from fresh kills. From fecal analysis alone, several researchers have found remains of prey items that are more likely to have been scavenged than hunted, and larger mammals are represented far less often in the analysis of hairs in fecal material than would be expected based only on bone collections at dens. Striped Hyenas appear to be strictly solitary foragers, although multiple individuals occasionally gather at rich food sources such as large carcasses or refuse pits. These animals are sometimes found in small groups while resting, but there is no indication that they ever forage cooperatively. Genetic relatedness among members of groups seen feeding together has not been investigated. Foraging activity in Kenya and Tanzania is restricted to hours of darkness except during rain or unusually cloudy weather. Under those circumstances, Striped Hyenas may return to previously visited kills or carcasses, but do not embark on full foraging forays. In many areas, and for many centuries, Striped Hyenas have been described as raiding human graves and carrying away bones. Fruit and vegetable crop raiding by Striped Hyenas is currently considered a serious problem in some parts of Israel . While foraging, Striped Hyenas zigzag across the landscape and do not appear to follow set routes, even when returning to the same food source on multiple nights. Minimum mean distance travelled per night is 19 km at speeds of 2-4 km/h, occasionally trotting at speeds of up to 8 km /h, or running at a maximum of 50 km /h. Overall, the evidence indicates that Striped Hyenas are solitary foragers for which carrion, insects, fruits and vegetable matter represent significant portions of the diet. Activity patterns. The Striped Hyena is almost strictly nocturnal, although it does occasionally engage in some activity after dawn and before dusk. Some authorities suggest Striped Hyenas may be moststrictly nocturnal in areas characterized by relatively intensive anthropogenic activity, and where they are directly persecuted by humans. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In Serengeti, Striped Hyenas travel an average of 19 km per night (range 7-27 km), either following established animal tracks or zig-zagging cross-country. A similar pattern was observed in southern Kenya , where Striped Hyenas followed by human observers covered large distances, but stopped frequently to paste or to investigate grass clumps, carcasses, and other things found on the ground along the way. Home range sizes of one female and one male in the Serengeti were 44 km * and 72 km ? respectively. There was little evidence of territorial behavior. Home range size was calculated for a single female in the Negev Desert in Israel to be approximately 61 km ?; this range partly overlapped those of two other individuals. In the Laikipia District of Kenya , the mean home rangesize for 12 males was 82 km ?, and for eight females was 71 km ? with no significant difference in home range sizes between sexes. No evidence ofterritorial defense has been recorded in any studied population, but in some populations these hyenas are known to scent-mark frequently within their home ranges while traveling, and also to defecate in “latrines” near feeding sites and along travel routes. Striped Hyenas are the least well-studied of the extant hyaenids, and their social behavior is very poorly understood. They are most often reported to be solitary. Nevertheless, there appears to be considerable variability with respect to patterns of social grouping among Striped Hyena populations. In some areas, such as central Asia, these animals are reported to form short-term monogamous pair bonds for breeding, with a resulting family unit that may endure for several years. Such family units may sometimes contain offspring from multiple litters. Under these circumstances, both parents and the older offspring may be observed provisioning den-dwelling cubs. Typical group sizes are one or two in all subspecies, but groups of up to seven have been reported in Libya . In Israel , Striped Hyenas are generally solitary, but occasionally several are seen together at a carcass, including both males and females, or females with large cubs. Age-specific foraging data are extremely limited, but cubs have occasionally been observed accompanying their mothers on foraging trips away from the den by 6-12 months of age. Otherwise, foraging is strictly solitary. Almost invariably described as solitary in sub-Saharan Africa, it was recently discovered that Striped Hyenas in the Laikipia District of Kenya are behaviorally solitary but exhibit a polyandrous system of space use. These animals form groups of up to four adults ; each group contains one adult female and one to three adult males. Females in both wild and captive populations appear to be highly intolerant of one another, starting around the time they reach puberty. The overall adult sex ratio in the Laikipia population was three males to two females . Members of these groups share a common home range and may be found resting together during daylight hours. The home ranges of group-mates exhibit 85% overlap, whereas their ranges overlap only 22% with those of animals in other groups. Individual group members spend more than 90% of their time alone. Adult male group-mates included both closely-related and distantly related individuals. In contrast to spatial patterns of relatedness documented in other carnivores, pairs in non-adjacent groups tended to be more closely related genetically than pairs living in adjacent groups. This was true for females as well as males. As these animals are usually found alone, very little has been recorded regarding direct social interactions except for captive situations. In this species, males are slightly larger than females, and males also appear to be socially dominant to females in resource competition. The long dorsal hairs of the mane may be erected to enhance the apparentsize of the individual during confrontations with conspecifics. Both mane and tail hairs are erected when the animal assumes a defensive posture, but also when it adopts an aggressive stance. The mane is also commonly bristled whenever the animal pastes. When Striped Hyenas fight they bite at the throat and legs, rather than at the mane. During an agonistic interaction, the subordinate individual may hunch its body, lower its mane, and swing or turn its head from side to side whereas the dominant animal remains bristled and stands erect. The Striped Hyena exhibits a number of visual displays, the moststriking of which is the erection of the mane and bristling ofthe tail like a bottle brush. The mane and tail thus serve as signalling devices during social interactions. When members of the same social group meet after being separated, they engage in “meeting ceremonies”, which involve investigation and licking of the mid-back region and sniffing of the nose and extruded anal pouch. The tail is often held vertically during meeting ceremonies. Meeting ceremonies may also involve repeated pawing of the throat of the greeting partner. The well-developed anal pouch is inverted during scent marking, called pasting, and also during greetings. In scent marking, the anal pouch produces a pungent yellow to beige paste which is deposited at nose-height on grass stalks, stones, tree-trunks, or sticks. Foraging Striped Hyenas pause to paste at frequent intervals, and these scent marks appear to be deposited throughout the home range rather than exclusively at its borders. Pasting has also been observed at large carcasses in the wild, and, in captivity, on food bowls. Some Striped Hyena vocalizations resemble those of Spotted Hyenas, although calls emitted by Striped Hyenas tend to be much softer, and the sounds carry shorter distances. The vocal repertoire of the Spotted Hyenais also far more elaborate than that of the Striped Hyena. Most ofits vocalizations are uttered in the presence of conspecifics. Cubs whine while they are nursing. Giggling or yelling may occur when a Striped Hyena is frightened or being chased by another predator. A long, drawn-out lowing sound sometimes accompanies the defensive posture, and growling may occur during fighting or play-fighting with conspecifics.",,"The Striped Hyena is almost strictly nocturnal, although it does occasionally engage in some activity after dawn and before dusk.

Cubs whine while they are nursing. Giggling or yelling may occur when a Striped Hyena is frightened or being chased by another predator. A long, drawn-out lowing sound sometimes accompanies the defensive posture, and growling may occur during fighting or play-fighting with conspecifics. Breeding. Females are polyestrous and breed throughout the year. Estrus is reported to last one day. No detailed descriptions of sexual behavior in the wild have been reported, but during matings in captivity, females may mate several times at intervals of at least 15 minutes. In the wild, litter size varies from one to four (median of three), after a gestation period of 90-91 days. Average litter size in captivity is 2-4, with a range of one to five. Parturition is preceded by intensive digging behavior by the female. Cubs weigh approximately 700 g at birth; they have adult-like markings but lack manes, and instead have only black spinal stripes. They are born with eyes and ears closed, and they are barely able to crawl, so they are far more altricial than Spotted Hyena cubs at birth. Their eyesfirst open after five to nine days, and cubs may emerge from the den at around two weeks of age. Deciduous teeth start to erupt on day 21. Cubs begin to eat meat at the age of 30 days. In the wild cubs are known to nurse for over one year. They reach reproductive maturity during the second year oflife. The mating system is promiscuous or polyandrous. In the Laikipia population in Kenya , females appear to mate with both group males and males that reside elsewhere. It is not known whether sires contribute in any way to parental care in this population, but lactating females are usually found alone at dens with their cubs, males do not spend significant periods of time at dens, and females appear to be solely responsible for care of young. Multiple paternity in this population occurred in half of sampled litters, and extra-group males sired roughly one third of the cubs born to group females. Striped Hyenas usually use caves, ravines or other sheltered rocky places as dens, although earthen dens may also be used. Den entrances are fairly narrow and may be hidden by large boulders. Two dens were measured in the Karakum Desert. The entrances were 0-67 m and 0-72 m wide. The dens sloped downward 3 m and 2bm and were 4-15 m and 5 m long, with no lateral extensions or special chambers. These simple constructions contrast with much more elaborate dens found in Israel , which can exceed 27 m in length.","Listed as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Despite their broad distribution, the basic biology of Striped Hyenas, including their abundance in most parts of their range, remains very poorly known. Throughout its range, the Striped Hyena occurs at low densities. There have been only two local estimates of Striped Hyena density in Africa, and it is considered either threatened or data deficient throughout its African range. In Serengeti and Laikipia, density was estimated to be 0-02 per km? and 0-03 adults per km?, respectively. Remarkably little information is available on the species. This is undoubtedly due to its shy, nocturnal, mostly solitary nature, its apparent affinity for rugged terrain, its generally negative reputation, and frequent confusion with, or lack of differentiation from, Spotted Hyenas where the two species overlap. Most adult mortality is directly caused by Lions and humans. Striped Hyenas, particularly those inhabiting areas where natural prey are usually or seasonally sparse, may attack livestock, and as a result they are shot, snared, speared, or poisoned in many parts of their range by ranchers and pastoralists. It appears that the Striped Hyena is already extinct in many localities, and that populations are generally declining. The major reasonsfor this decline appear to be decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores and their prey, and changes in livestock practices. Moreover, the low densities and associated large home ranges of these animals are likely to increase the chances that populations will become fragmented into small, non-viable units. This must be considered a key problem if these animals are to be protected. The Striped Hyena evokes many superstitious fears because of putative and documented cases of grave-robbing and attacks on humans. In addition,its body parts are widely exploited as aphrodisiacs, and are utilized in folk medicine. Striped Hyenas are often killed because of suspected or real damage inflicted on agricultural produce and livestock, and they are often shot by livestock ranchers. These animals have also been widely hunted through poisoning, baiting traps, pits, or with the help of dogs. The Striped Hyena does sometimes cause damage to crops, and may sometimes also attack domestic animals, predominantly goats, sheep, dogs, and poultry. In many cases of damage to livestock, it is unclear whether the targeted individual was adult or young, healthy or sick, so Striped Hyenas may be blamed for livestock mortality for which they are not truly responsible. In any case, the records suggest that attacks on livestock by Striped Hyenas usually occur at very low frequencies. Tentative estimates of the total worldwide population size range from 5000 to 14,000 individuals. Fragmentation into many subpopulations is suspected even though the actual degree of fragmentation is unknown. In addition, habitat loss and declining population size are occurring at unknown rates. The Striped Hyena is considered threatened in all parts of its African range where data are sufficient to evaluate the local status, except in Ethiopia and Kenya , whereit is considered at lowerrisk. As we currently know so little about the biology ofthis species, one of the most pressing conservation concerns is to study these animals in a number of different locales. In addition to knowing very little about their behavioral ecology, we also know virtually nothing about their abundance and population dynamics. Before we can make management decisions in the best interest of Striped Hyenas, we need more information. Fortunately, studies of these animals are currently underway in East Africa, India , and the Middle East.","Bouskila (1984) | Davidar (1990) | Hofer (1998) | Horwitz & Smith (1988) | Kerbis-Peterhans & Horwitz (1992) | Koepfli et al.

Striped Hyena Hyaena hyaena French: Hyéne rayée / German: Streifenhyane / Spanish: Hiena rayada Taxonomy. Canis hyaena Linnaeus, 1758 , India . Of the extant hyaenids, the Striped Hyena is most closely related to the Brown Hyena, and its lifestyle, reproduction, and social behavior more closely resemble those of Brown Hyenas than those of Spotted Hyenas or Aardwolves. Some authorities provisionally recognize five subspecies, distinguished mainly by differences in size and pelage ( hyaena from India , barbara from NW Africa, dubbah from NE Africa, sultana from the Arabian Peninsula, and syriaca from Syria , Asia Minor and the Caucasus). However, other authorities argue that current morphological data and other evidence do not support multiple subspecies. Distribution. The Striped Hyena has a very large range, covering much of Africa and western Asia. Although they do not occur in the central Sahara, these animals occur at low density in patches throughout eastern, western and northern Africa, including Algeria , Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Libya , Mali , Nigeria , Mauritania , Morocco , Niger , Senegal , Tanzania , and Tunisia . Striped Hyenas also occur in the Middle East and Central Asia. Middle Eastern and Asian countries included in the modern distribution of the Striped Hyena are Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , India , Iran , Iraq , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Nepal , Oman , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Tajikistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Yemen . The current distribution of this species is patchy, and usually appears to occur in small, isolated populations. Descriptive notes. The Striped Hyena is the smallest of the three bone-cracking hyaenids, but is substantially larger than the Aardwolf. Head-body 100-115 cm,tail 30-40 cm, shoulder height between 66-75 cm; weight 26-41 kg (males) and 26-34 kg (females). Among the provisional subspecies, body mass and body size are only well studied in syriaca in Israel and dubbah in Kenya . In these populations, there was no significant sexual dimorphism in body size. However, in one recent study in Israel , sexual dimorphism accounted for 39% of the variation in adult body size. Like the other hyaenids, the Striped Hyena has a sloping back because the forelegs are longer than the hindlegs, and has well-developed anal glands used for scent marking. Large ducts from the anal glands open into an anal pouch dorsal to the anus. As in the other bonecracking Hyenas, the head, neck, and shoulders are relatively massive and powerful. The fur is pale gray or straw-colored, with black vertical stripes on the sides of the body. Like the Brown Hyena, the Striped Hyena has longer fur than the Spotted Hyena, giving it a rather shaggy appearance. The Striped Hyena has a black muzzle and a black patch on the throat. It has five to nine vertical stripes on the flanks, two cheek stripes, and clear black transverse and horizontal stripes on all four legs. The head is roundish with a pointed muzzle and long, pointed ears. It has a gray or blond mane that runs along its dorsal midline from the ears to the tail; the mane can be erected to increase the animal’s apparentsize by over 30%. The mane in this species is more pronounced than that in any other hyaenid, with hairs up to 20 cm long. The black and white tail is long and bushy, with hair that is generally coarse and long. Females have two or three pairs of teats, but if they have three, only the caudal two pairs are functional. Juvenile females have well-defined labia-like folds anterior to the vagina. These ridges are hairless and darker and rougher than the surrounding tissue. Juvenile males have smaller, smooth, hairless skin folds along the middle septum close to, but anterior to, the scrotum. Unlike Spotted Hyenas, these genital characteristics are not severe enough to confuse sexing of juveniles, and adult genitalia appear normal. Subspecies descriptions are based on limited data except for syriaca in Israel and dubbah in Kenya . In general animals living in the northern parts of the range tend to be slightly larger than those living in southern regions. Variation in pelage color appearsslight, although the Lebanese population is reported to have a reddish coat color, and hyenas on the Arabian Peninsula are described as having a yellow mark below the eyes and a mixed gray and black dorsal crest. Habitat. In most ofits range the Striped Hyena occurs in rugged, arid habitat or light thorn bush country. These animals drink regularly where wateris available, but they can also survive in many waterless areas. In North Africa they prefer open woodlands and bushy and mountainous regions. The central Arabian and Sahara Deserts are not suitable habitat. In central Asia, Striped Hyenas avoid high altitudes and dense thickets and forests. The maximum elevations recorded are 2250 m in Iran , 2500 m in India and 3300 m in Pakistan . In the Caucasus region, Turkmenistan , Tadzhikistan , and Uzbekistan , prime habitats include savannah and semi-desert regions up to an elevation of 2100 m , mountain areas with strong relief, valleys with abundant caves or other resting sites, and riverine areas. The Striped Hyena avoids areas with minimum temperatures ofless than —15°C to —20°C and more than 80-120 days offrost per year. In Israel , Striped Hyenas are present even close to dense human settlements. In West Africa, they occur in dry scrub savanna and Sahel woodland, particularly in the belt of Acacia raddiana woodland that extends from Senegal to Chad . In eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are found in a variety of habitats ranging from open savanna to rugged, bush-covered mountain terrain. Food and Feeding. The diet of Striped Hyenas apparently varies considerably from one part of their range to another, but these animals are clearly scavengers with catholic tastes. They are primarily carrion-eaters; their diet consists mainly of dried flesh and bones from carcasses of large vertebrates. They scavenge carrion and the remains of kills made by other predators, including Spotted Hyenas, Cheetahs, Leopards, Lions, and Tigers. The Hyena’s massive cheek teeth and supporting musculature easily permit the gnawing and breaking of bones, as well as the carapaces of tortoises and turtles. Striped Hyenas have also been reported to consume a wide variety of invertebrates, vegetables, fruit, garbage, and small vertebrates that the Hyenas hunt themselves. In central Kenya , analysis of bone fragments and hairs from fecal samples indicated that hyenas regularly consume small mammals and birds that are unlikely to be scavenged. The limited available diet data may underestimate the importance of active hunting in the lives of these animals. In various parts of eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are reported to supplement their diet with Balanites fruits. The proportion of scavenged and killed prey items in the diet is still a matter of debate as there has been no detailed research on these Hyenas’ food intake. Some authors suggest that only individuals from the three larger subspecies, barbara, syriaca and hyaena , kill large prey, including livestock,as there is no evidence that the smaller subspecies, dubbah and sultana, attack large herbivores. In Turkmenistan the Striped Hyena has been reported feeding on Wild Boar, Kulan, porcupine, and particularly tortoises. In Uzbekhistan and Tadzhikistan , seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits (Eleagnus angustifolia) is reflected in the diet; in the Caucasus region the diet includes abundant grasshoppers. In Israel the Striped Hyena feeds on garbage, carrion, and fruits, particularly dates and melons. In eastern Jordan , the main sources of food are carcasses of feral horses and water buffalo and refuse from localvillages. The Striped Hyena can drink water of very variable quality, from fresh water to soda and salt water, but it may also satisfy its water requirements with melons or otherfruits. Very little is currently known about the hunting behavior of Striped Hyenas, but those few hunts that have been observed involved simple chases and grabs at prey. Seasonal influxes of Striped Hyenas follow migrations of large herds of domestic and wild ungulates in Turkmenistan , suggesting that the Hyenas cover long distances on foraging trips. In Egypt they are known to move along ancient caravan roads where the chance of locating dead camels is high. In Serengeti and in southern Kenya , they spend most of the night actively searching for food or moving between established foraging sites. Striped Hyenas apparently can remember the locations offruiting trees, garbage dumps and other established feeding sites, although the routes taken to re-visit such food sources are seldom repeated on consecutive foraging trips. They are also able to locate tortoises in their hiding places during periods of aestivation and hibernation. Striped Hyenas frequently cache bones or pieces of skin, using their snouts to push these items deep into clumps of grass or stands of dense shrubs. They may also carry food items back to their dens. Bone collections are common at den sites used by Striped Hyenas, although it is often unclear whether these collections represent scavenged or killed prey, and whether the bones collected play a significant nutritional role in the lives of these animals. Several studies have inferred diet by combining data from bone collections and fecal samples. In central Kenya , however, bone collections indicated a much broader range of prey than did scat analysis, and significant portions of bone assemblages were very old bones unlikely to represent material scavenged from fresh kills. From fecal analysis alone, several researchers have found remains of prey items that are more likely to have been scavenged than hunted, and larger mammals are represented far less often in the analysis of hairs in fecal material than would be expected based only on bone collections at dens. Striped Hyenas appear to be strictly solitary foragers, although multiple individuals occasionally gather at rich food sources such as large carcasses or refuse pits. These animals are sometimes found in small groups while resting, but there is no indication that they ever forage cooperatively. Genetic relatedness among members of groups seen feeding together has not been investigated. Foraging activity in Kenya and Tanzania is restricted to hours of darkness except during rain or unusually cloudy weather. Under those circumstances, Striped Hyenas may return to previously visited kills or carcasses, but do not embark on full foraging forays. In many areas, and for many centuries, Striped Hyenas have been described as raiding human graves and carrying away bones. Fruit and vegetable crop raiding by Striped Hyenas is currently considered a serious problem in some parts of Israel . While foraging, Striped Hyenas zigzag across the landscape and do not appear to follow set routes, even when returning to the same food source on multiple nights. Minimum mean distance travelled per night is 19 km at speeds of 2-4 km/h, occasionally trotting at speeds of up to 8 km /h, or running at a maximum of 50 km /h. Overall, the evidence indicates that Striped Hyenas are solitary foragers for which carrion, insects, fruits and vegetable matter represent significant portions of the diet. Activity patterns. The Striped Hyena is almost strictly nocturnal, although it does occasionally engage in some activity after dawn and before dusk. Some authorities suggest Striped Hyenas may be moststrictly nocturnal in areas characterized by relatively intensive anthropogenic activity, and where they are directly persecuted by humans. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In Serengeti, Striped Hyenas travel an average of 19 km per night (range 7-27 km), either following established animal tracks or zig-zagging cross-country. A similar pattern was observed in southern Kenya , where Striped Hyenas followed by human observers covered large distances, but stopped frequently to paste or to investigate grass clumps, carcasses, and other things found on the ground along the way. Home range sizes of one female and one male in the Serengeti were 44 km * and 72 km ? respectively. There was little evidence of territorial behavior. Home range size was calculated for a single female in the Negev Desert in Israel to be approximately 61 km ?; this range partly overlapped those of two other individuals. In the Laikipia District of Kenya , the mean home rangesize for 12 males was 82 km ?, and for eight females was 71 km ? with no significant difference in home range sizes between sexes. No evidence ofterritorial defense has been recorded in any studied population, but in some populations these hyenas are known to scent-mark frequently within their home ranges while traveling, and also to defecate in “latrines” near feeding sites and along travel routes. Striped Hyenas are the least well-studied of the extant hyaenids, and their social behavior is very poorly understood. They are most often reported to be solitary. Nevertheless, there appears to be considerable variability with respect to patterns of social grouping among Striped Hyena populations. In some areas, such as central Asia, these animals are reported to form short-term monogamous pair bonds for breeding, with a resulting family unit that may endure for several years. Such family units may sometimes contain offspring from multiple litters. Under these circumstances, both parents and the older offspring may be observed provisioning den-dwelling cubs. Typical group sizes are one or two in all subspecies, but groups of up to seven have been reported in Libya . In Israel , Striped Hyenas are generally solitary, but occasionally several are seen together at a carcass, including both males and females, or females with large cubs. Age-specific foraging data are extremely limited, but cubs have occasionally been observed accompanying their mothers on foraging trips away from the den by 6-12 months of age. Otherwise, foraging is strictly solitary. Almost invariably described as solitary in sub-Saharan Africa, it was recently discovered that Striped Hyenas in the Laikipia District of Kenya are behaviorally solitary but exhibit a polyandrous system of space use. These animals form groups of up to four adults ; each group contains one adult female and one to three adult males. Females in both wild and captive populations appear to be highly intolerant of one another, starting around the time they reach puberty. The overall adult sex ratio in the Laikipia population was three males to two females . Members of these groups share a common home range and may be found resting together during daylight hours. The home ranges of group-mates exhibit 85% overlap, whereas their ranges overlap only 22% with those of animals in other groups. Individual group members spend more than 90% of their time alone. Adult male group-mates included both closely-related and distantly related individuals. In contrast to spatial patterns of relatedness documented in other carnivores, pairs in non-adjacent groups tended to be more closely related genetically than pairs living in adjacent groups. This was true for females as well as males. As these animals are usually found alone, very little has been recorded regarding direct social interactions except for captive situations. In this species, males are slightly larger than females, and males also appear to be socially dominant to females in resource competition. The long dorsal hairs of the mane may be erected to enhance the apparentsize of the individual during confrontations with conspecifics. Both mane and tail hairs are erected when the animal assumes a defensive posture, but also when it adopts an aggressive stance. The mane is also commonly bristled whenever the animal pastes. When Striped Hyenas fight they bite at the throat and legs, rather than at the mane. During an agonistic interaction, the subordinate individual may hunch its body, lower its mane, and swing or turn its head from side to side whereas the dominant animal remains bristled and stands erect. The Striped Hyena exhibits a number of visual displays, the moststriking of which is the erection of the mane and bristling ofthe tail like a bottle brush. The mane and tail thus serve as signalling devices during social interactions. When members of the same social group meet after being separated, they engage in “meeting ceremonies”, which involve investigation and licking of the mid-back region and sniffing of the nose and extruded anal pouch. The tail is often held vertically during meeting ceremonies. Meeting ceremonies may also involve repeated pawing of the throat of the greeting partner. The well-developed anal pouch is inverted during scent marking, called pasting, and also during greetings. In scent marking, the anal pouch produces a pungent yellow to beige paste which is deposited at nose-height on grass stalks, stones, tree-trunks, or sticks. Foraging Striped Hyenas pause to paste at frequent intervals, and these scent marks appear to be deposited throughout the home range rather than exclusively at its borders. Pasting has also been observed at large carcasses in the wild, and, in captivity, on food bowls. Some Striped Hyena vocalizations resemble those of Spotted Hyenas, although calls emitted by Striped Hyenas tend to be much softer, and the sounds carry shorter distances. The vocal repertoire of the Spotted Hyenais also far more elaborate than that of the Striped Hyena. Most ofits vocalizations are uttered in the presence of conspecifics. Cubs whine while they are nursing. Giggling or yelling may occur when a Striped Hyena is frightened or being chased by another predator. A long, drawn-out lowing sound sometimes accompanies the defensive posture, and growling may occur during fighting or play-fighting with conspecifics. Breeding. Females are polyestrous and breed throughout the year. Estrus is reported to last one day. No detailed descriptions of sexual behavior in the wild have been reported, but during matings in captivity, females may mate several times at intervals of at least 15 minutes. In the wild, litter size varies from one to four (median of three), after a gestation period of 90-91 days. Average litter size in captivity is 2-4, with a range of one to five. Parturition is preceded by intensive digging behavior by the female. Cubs weigh approximately 700 g at birth; they have adult-like markings but lack manes, and instead have only black spinal stripes. They are born with eyes and ears closed, and they are barely able to crawl, so they are far more altricial than Spotted Hyena cubs at birth. Their eyesfirst open after five to nine days, and cubs may emerge from the den at around two weeks of age. Deciduous teeth start to erupt on day 21. Cubs begin to eat meat at the age of 30 days. In the wild cubs are known to nurse for over one year. They reach reproductive maturity during the second year oflife. The mating system is promiscuous or polyandrous. In the Laikipia population in Kenya , females appear to mate with both group males and males that reside elsewhere. It is not known whether sires contribute in any way to parental care in this population, but lactating females are usually found alone at dens with their cubs, males do not spend significant periods of time at dens, and females appear to be solely responsible for care of young. Multiple paternity in this population occurred in half of sampled litters, and extra-group males sired roughly one third of the cubs born to group females. Striped Hyenas usually use caves, ravines or other sheltered rocky places as dens, although earthen dens may also be used. Den entrances are fairly narrow and may be hidden by large boulders. Two dens were measured in the Karakum Desert. The entrances were 0-67 m and 0-72 m wide. The dens sloped downward 3 m and 2bm and were 4-15 m and 5 m long, with no lateral extensions or special chambers. These simple constructions contrast with much more elaborate dens found in Israel , which can exceed 27 m in length. Status and Conservation. Listed as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Despite their broad distribution, the basic biology of Striped Hyenas, including their abundance in most parts of their range, remains very poorly known. Throughout its range, the Striped Hyena occurs at low densities. There have been only two local estimates of Striped Hyena density in Africa, and it is considered either threatened or data deficient throughout its African range. In Serengeti and Laikipia, density was estimated to be 0-02 per km? and 0-03 adults per km?, respectively. Remarkably little information is available on the species. This is undoubtedly due to its shy, nocturnal, mostly solitary nature, its apparent affinity for rugged terrain, its generally negative reputation, and frequent confusion with, or lack of differentiation from, Spotted Hyenas where the two species overlap. Most adult mortality is directly caused by Lions and humans. Striped Hyenas, particularly those inhabiting areas where natural prey are usually or seasonally sparse, may attack livestock, and as a result they are shot, snared, speared, or poisoned in many parts of their range by ranchers and pastoralists. It appears that the Striped Hyena is already extinct in many localities, and that populations are generally declining. The major reasonsfor this decline appear to be decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores and their prey, and changes in livestock practices. Moreover, the low densities and associated large home ranges of these animals are likely to increase the chances that populations will become fragmented into small, non-viable units. This must be considered a key problem if these animals are to be protected. The Striped Hyena evokes many superstitious fears because of putative and documented cases of grave-robbing and attacks on humans. In addition,its body parts are widely exploited as aphrodisiacs, and are utilized in folk medicine. Striped Hyenas are often killed because of suspected or real damage inflicted on agricultural produce and livestock, and they are often shot by livestock ranchers. These animals have also been widely hunted through poisoning, baiting traps, pits, or with the help of dogs. The Striped Hyena does sometimes cause damage to crops, and may sometimes also attack domestic animals, predominantly goats, sheep, dogs, and poultry. In many cases of damage to livestock, it is unclear whether the targeted individual was adult or young, healthy or sick, so Striped Hyenas may be blamed for livestock mortality for which they are not truly responsible. In any case, the records suggest that attacks on livestock by Striped Hyenas usually occur at very low frequencies. Tentative estimates of the total worldwide population size range from 5000 to 14,000 individuals. Fragmentation into many subpopulations is suspected even though the actual degree of fragmentation is unknown. In addition, habitat loss and declining population size are occurring at unknown rates. The Striped Hyena is considered threatened in all parts of its African range where data are sufficient to evaluate the local status, except in Ethiopia and Kenya , whereit is considered at lowerrisk. As we currently know so little about the biology ofthis species, one of the most pressing conservation concerns is to study these animals in a number of different locales. In addition to knowing very little about their behavioral ecology, we also know virtually nothing about their abundance and population dynamics. Before we can make management decisions in the best interest of Striped Hyenas, we need more information. Fortunately, studies of these animals are currently underway in East Africa, India , and the Middle East. Bibliography.

Monotypic.","Arctic Ocean: Canada , USA ( Alaska ), Greenland , Norway ( Svalbard ), Russia . Have been sighted within 0-5° of North Pole.","Head-body 180-280 cm, shoulder height up to 170 cm ,tail 6-13 cm; adult males are about twice as heavy (300-650 kg, but up to 800 kg ) as adult females (150-250 kg, but up to 500 kg when pregnant), making them one of the most sexuallydimorphic mammals. Size varies regionally, being smallest in eastern Greenland , and progressively larger westward to the Bering Sea. Facial profile is straight, the neck is longer than in other bears, and the ears are small in relation to head and body size. Coat color appears white or yellowish, with no other markings, but can accumulate colors from the environment (e.g. blood and oils from killed prey). In reality, both guard hairs and underfur are translucent, and guard hairs are hollow, thus enhancing their insulation properties. However, a previous assertion that they act as fiber optic tubes, funneling sunlight to the skin for warmth, has been disproven. The skin is black, but only the black nose is visible. Summer coats are shorter than winter coats, but unlike other bears, coat thickness is not sparser ventrally. Additionally, the paws are well-furred on the underside, and have small soft papillae and vacuoles that may act as suction cups for traction on ice. The feet are also relatively large, providing more surface area for swimming and walking on thin ice. The claws are shorter and more curved than Brown Bears, and are usually dark-colored.","Arctic ice provides a necessary platform for hunting seals. Annual ice adjacent to coastlines (shore fast ice) regularly fractures, providing open leads where seals can breathe. The seasonal fluctuations between freezing and open water also promotes high productivity of fish, the prey of seals. Thus, this habitat is preferred by seals, and is consequently a favored habitat for Polar Bears, which hunt seals along the ice cracks and edges. Polar Bears also hunt from large chunks of drifting ice, and to a lesser extent, multiannual pack ice, where seal density is lower and access to seals more difficult. For this reason, density of Polar Bearsis low close to the North Pole. In summer, when the ice retreats, bears either migrate northward or use nearshore terrestrial habitats. Parturient females stay ashore to den and give birth. In Hudson Bay ( Canada ) they den 10-80 km inland in peat banks; elsewhere maternity dens are typically in snow caves along coastal areas. However, in the Beaufort Sea, half the pregnant females den on drifting sea ice. Non-pregnant bears do not hibernate, but do use shelter dens. At lower latitudes, they use shelters on land during ice-free periods to escape heat and conserve energy when precluded from hunting seals; at high latitudes (above 75° N ) they seek shelters on thick sea ice during winter, when foraging is most difficult and weather conditions harshest.","Almoststrictly carnivorous, preying mainly on young Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida), to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (Erignathus barbatus), and in some areas, Harp Seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus). The principal focus on Ringed Seals is evident in the close association between Polar Bear density and Ringed Seal density, and in the unique behavior of these seals, which give birth in subnivian lairs as an anti-predation strategy. One study found that an average Polar Bear consumes fewer than 50 Ringed Seals a year, 80% being pups caught either in their lairs or shortly after emerging from their lairs. Polar Bears also occasionally prey on other marine mammals, such as Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus), and Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. These large prey, including Bearded Seals (which are much larger than Ringed Seals), are taken mainly by adult male bears. When ashore, depending on availability, Polar Bears have been observed to prey on Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), seabirds, or fish; and eat carrion (dead whales), berries, vegetation, and human garbage. Activity patterns. Appear to be mainly diurnal. Seasonal changes in activity vary regionally with dynamics of sea ice and abundance of prey. Activity, measured by percent of time active and distance moved,is elevated when seal pups are particularly naive and vulnerable to predation, and when older seals are molting and basking on the ice. In contrast to other predators, Polar Bears are most active when prey is most abundant. They become hyperphagic, and are able to store fat to withstand extended periods when foraging is more difficult, such as during the winter on the pack ice. Periods of rapid annual ice formation and ablation, during summer and fall, also result in greater activity. Parturient females den for about six months (mid-September to mid-March in most areas); non-pregnant Polar Bears do not hibernate. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Although once thought to wander aimlessly or be carried passively on shifting ice, recent data collected using satellite radio collars have shown that Polar Bears have definite home ranges that are used year to year. However, these ranges can be enormous: one female bear traveled over 5200 km from Alaska to Greenland in four months. Nevertheless, most bears seem to remain within a discrete population, or stock; 19 or 20 such populations have been identified across the geographic range. Home ranges and movements are highly variable by region, habitat, season, and reproductive condition or family association. Around Svalbard , nearshore bears tend to have smaller home ranges than pelagic bears. In the Canadian Arctic, bears that live in areas with highly variable and unpredictable ice conditions (including ice-free periods) have larger ranges than bears living on more stable ice. Individual ranges as large as 600,000 km * have been reported, but so have ranges of less than 1000 km ®. Means among different populations range from 20,000-250,000 km?. Little movement data have been collected on males, because they cannot be radio-collared (their necks are bigger than their heads), but data from implanted transmitters indicate that, unlike terrestrial bears, their ranges are not larger than those of females. With females being so mobile, and having highly overlapping ranges, males can include multiple potential breeding partners within their range, even if their range is not larger than the females’. Female maternity dens are highly congregated in some areas, such as Wrangel Island, parts of Svalbard , Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, and near Churchill, Manitoba.",,"Appear to be mainly diurnal.

Female maternity dens are highly congregated in some areas, such as Wrangel Island, parts of Svalbard , Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, and near Churchill, Manitoba. Breeding. Breeding occurs from March to June. Mating induces ovulation, and males spar for mating partners. Implantation of the fertilized egg is delayed until autumn, about the time that females enter maternity dens. In some areas this follows a period of on-shore fasting, so by the time these mothers emerge from dens the following spring they may not have eaten for eight months. Birthing occurs mid-November to January, so the total gestation, including the period of delayed implantation, is from 6:5 to more than 8-5 months. Cubs stay in the den until March or early April. Two-cublitters are most common, and average litter size is less than two in virtually all populations; however, litters of three are not uncommon in some areas, and litters of four have been reported. Females have only four mammae (other bears, except Sun Bears and Giant Pandas have six), so this is the maximum litter size. Average age offirst birthing ranges among different populations from 4-6-7-2 years. Productivity increases into the teen years, but then declines through the early 20s, and ceases by the late 20s. Intervals between litters average 2-1-3-6 years. Cubs separate from their mother either at 17 months, or more commonly a year later. Cubs may nurse through their second birthday. The fat content of milk is very high initially (more than 30%), but declines through the nursing period.","CITES Appendix II. In 2006 The IUCN Red List status was upgraded to Vulnerable due to projections of dramatic reductions in habitat (coverage and stability of the ice sheet) over the next 50-100 years. Demographic consequences to Polar Bears are already becoming apparent in some areas, in terms of reduced numbers and reduced survival ofjuveniles and old adults. Ringed Seals are also suffering increased mortality from Polar Bear predation because of melting of their subnivian dens. Accordingly, the USA listed the species as nationally threatened and Canada listed it as a species of special concern. This would impose further constraints on activities that affect these bears or their habitat, such as hunting, recreational viewing, shipping, and oil and gas exploration and development. The effects of sea ice change will vary enormously by region, which is difficult to forecast, but overall arelikely to be dramatic and permanent. Nineteen fairly discrete populations have been identified, with a total world population estimated at 20,000-25,000; about half this number resides in the Canadian territory of Nunavut . Under an agreement for co-management of Polar Bear populations that was ratified in 1976, the five range countries coordinate and consult with each other on research activities, methods of population estimation and monitoring, and proposals for increased protection. Most importantly, under this treaty, harvestis restricted: the taking of cubs or females with cubs is prohibited, and harvest is limited to native people for subsistence use. This includes consumption of meat, use of hides for clothing, and creation of handicrafts. In some territories of Canada , a portion of the annual harvest is allocated to non-native sport hunters who employ native guides and hunt using dogsleds and other traditional methods. This generates income for the native communities. Harvests are regulated to be sustainable. Recently, pressure has mounted to reduce or prohibit harvests so as not to compound the effects of diminishing sea ice habitat from global warming.","Amstrup (2003) | Amstrup & Gardner (1994) | Amstrup et al.

Activity, measured by percent of time active and distance moved,is elevated when seal pups are particularly naive and vulnerable to predation, and when older seals are molting and basking on the ice. In contrast to other predators, Polar Bears are most active when prey is most abundant. They become hyperphagic, and are able to store fat to withstand extended periods when foraging is more difficult, such as during the winter on the pack ice. Periods of rapid annual ice formation and ablation, during summer and fall, also result in greater activity. Parturient females den for about six months (mid-September to mid-March in most areas); non-pregnant Polar Bears do not hibernate. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Although once thought to wander aimlessly or be carried passively on shifting ice, recent data collected using satellite radio collars have shown that Polar Bears have definite home ranges that are used year to year. However, these ranges can be enormous: one female bear traveled over 5200 km from Alaska to Greenland in four months. Nevertheless, most bears seem to remain within a discrete population, or stock; 19 or 20 such populations have been identified across the geographic range. Home ranges and movements are highly variable by region, habitat, season, and reproductive condition or family association. Around Svalbard , nearshore bears tend to have smaller home ranges than pelagic bears. In the Canadian Arctic, bears that live in areas with highly variable and unpredictable ice conditions (including ice-free periods) have larger ranges than bears living on more stable ice. Individual ranges as large as 600,000 km * have been reported, but so have ranges of less than 1000 km ®. Means among different populations range from 20,000-250,000 km?. Little movement data have been collected on males, because they cannot be radio-collared (their necks are bigger than their heads), but data from implanted transmitters indicate that, unlike terrestrial bears, their ranges are not larger than those of females. With females being so mobile, and having highly overlapping ranges, males can include multiple potential breeding partners within their range, even if their range is not larger than the females’. Female maternity dens are highly congregated in some areas, such as Wrangel Island, parts of Svalbard , Franz Josef Land, Novaya Zemlya, and near Churchill, Manitoba. Breeding. Breeding occurs from March to June. Mating induces ovulation, and males spar for mating partners. Implantation of the fertilized egg is delayed until autumn, about the time that females enter maternity dens. In some areas this follows a period of on-shore fasting, so by the time these mothers emerge from dens the following spring they may not have eaten for eight months. Birthing occurs mid-November to January, so the total gestation, including the period of delayed implantation, is from 6:5 to more than 8-5 months. Cubs stay in the den until March or early April. Two-cublitters are most common, and average litter size is less than two in virtually all populations; however, litters of three are not uncommon in some areas, and litters of four have been reported. Females have only four mammae (other bears, except Sun Bears and Giant Pandas have six), so this is the maximum litter size. Average age offirst birthing ranges among different populations from 4-6-7-2 years. Productivity increases into the teen years, but then declines through the early 20s, and ceases by the late 20s. Intervals between litters average 2-1-3-6 years. Cubs separate from their mother either at 17 months, or more commonly a year later. Cubs may nurse through their second birthday. The fat content of milk is very high initially (more than 30%), but declines through the nursing period. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. In 2006 The IUCN Red List status was upgraded to Vulnerable due to projections of dramatic reductions in habitat (coverage and stability of the ice sheet) over the next 50-100 years. Demographic consequences to Polar Bears are already becoming apparent in some areas, in terms of reduced numbers and reduced survival ofjuveniles and old adults. Ringed Seals are also suffering increased mortality from Polar Bear predation because of melting of their subnivian dens. Accordingly, the USA listed the species as nationally threatened and Canada listed it as a species of special concern. This would impose further constraints on activities that affect these bears or their habitat, such as hunting, recreational viewing, shipping, and oil and gas exploration and development. The effects of sea ice change will vary enormously by region, which is difficult to forecast, but overall arelikely to be dramatic and permanent. Nineteen fairly discrete populations have been identified, with a total world population estimated at 20,000-25,000; about half this number resides in the Canadian territory of Nunavut . Under an agreement for co-management of Polar Bear populations that was ratified in 1976, the five range countries coordinate and consult with each other on research activities, methods of population estimation and monitoring, and proposals for increased protection. Most importantly, under this treaty, harvestis restricted: the taking of cubs or females with cubs is prohibited, and harvest is limited to native people for subsistence use. This includes consumption of meat, use of hides for clothing, and creation of handicrafts. In some territories of Canada , a portion of the annual harvest is allocated to non-native sport hunters who employ native guides and hunt using dogsleds and other traditional methods. This generates income for the native communities. Harvests are regulated to be sustainable. Recently, pressure has mounted to reduce or prohibit harvests so as not to compound the effects of diminishing sea ice habitat from global warming. Bibliography.

Weights vary regionally and seasonally, with food availability. Adult males are heavier (130-550 kg; rarely up to 725 kg ) than adult females (80-250 kg, but occasionally up to 340 kg ). Facial profile from forehead to nose is concave. Body profile includes a distinct muscular shoulder hump with long hairs. Coat color varies from uniform brown to mixed shades of brown, blond, and silver-tipped (grizzled), to partly gray or black, or fully black. The grizzled phase (Grizzly Bear) occurs in interior North America, whereas the black and partially black phases occur in eastern and central Asia. Color can lighten with bleaching from the sun. Prominent markings, from a white or creamcolored chest patch to a solid band that wrap across the chest and around the shoulders to the back, vary regionally and individually. Such markings are often present on cubs, but may be lost with age. Body hairs are sparser ventrally. Underfur is grown in fall, and molted in spring. Long, powerful, slightly curved front claws (4-10 cm) varying from dark brown to yellow to white, are characteristic. Foot pads are like that of the American Black Bear.","Brown Bears occupy a wider range of habitats than any other bear, including both coniferous and deciduous forests, meadows, grasslands, Arctic shrublands and tundra, alpine tundra, semi-deserts and deserts. Their range overlaps that of both the American and Asiatic Black Bear, and also slightly that of the Polar Bear. They exist at elevations from sea level (temperate rainforests and Arctic tundra) to well above treeline (dry Asian steppes); highest elevation sightings (tracks in snow) have been at 5500 m (possibly 5800 m ) in the Himalayas, and highest latitude sightings at 74° N ( Canada ), well into Polar Bear range.","Food habits vary regionally from principally herbivorous to principally carnivorous, depending on habitat. Plant foods include grasses, sedges, horsetails, forbs, roots, berries, and nuts. Animal foods include insects, rodents, ungulates, and fish. Insects are a significant dietary component in broadleaved forests of Europe, rodents and ungulates are most important in Arctic and alpine areas and some Boreal forests, and fish are paramount along the Pacific Coast, from British Columbia to Alaska to Kamchatka ( Russia ). Herbaceous vegetation tends to be the chief component of the spring diet. Later the bears switch to roots, berries, pine nuts, acorns, ants, bees, moths, ground squirrels, marmots, pikas, neonate ungulates, or spawning salmon, depending on availability. This species is morphologically and behaviorally well adapted to digging up insects and underground rodents,killing ungulates (including domestic species, like sheep and cattle), and catching salmon. In North America they rarely climb trees, whereas in Europe and parts of Asia they do so more regularly. Activity patterns. Active diurnally in North America, except where human activity is high. Nocturnally active in most of Europe, possibly due to more frequent contact with humans, both historically and presently. Young bears in Europe are active uniformly through the day, but apparently learn to become more nocturnal through negative experiences with people. Total time active per day (40-80%) varies with local conditions (food, day length). The period of hibernation also varies regionally: at the northern extremes of their range they may hibernate for seven months (October-May); conversely, on Kodiak Island, Alaska, where winters are mild and some food may remain available, about one-quarter of the males do not den all winter, an unusual anomaly among Brown Bears. In Russia , following seasons with very poor food, large numbers of malnourished bears may wander about for much of the winter. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Individual home range sizes vary by nearly four orders of magnitude (7-30,000 km?), related to food supply and bear density. Home ranges are largest in the barren-ground Arctic tundra, averaging 8000 km ? for males. Rangesizes are smaller in boreal or montane forests, where large mammals are a main dietary component, and smaller yet in deciduous or mixed forests with hard mast. In coastal areas, with abundant food and high bear density, home ranges are smallest, averaging less than 200 km ” for males and less than 100 km ? for females. Male home ranges are typically three to four times larger than those of females; both sexes increase their ranges during the mating season to maximize overlap with potential mates. Bear density and home range overlap are high in coastal populations with abundant and predictable food (spawning salmon). In interior populations, with less abundant or more variable food, home ranges overlap less, and bears may be somewhat territorial. In extreme northern populations, where food resources are scarce, home ranges are large and indefensible, so overlap is high. Home range overlap is also positively associated with relatedness, because female offspring often settle near their mother, assuming part of their natal home range. Multigenerational, matrilineal assemblages occur in established populations, whereas females may be more prone to disperse and settle among unrelated individuals in expanding populations. Males disperse in either case, but their dispersal age (1-4 years old) is related to their growth rate, and dispersal distance is inversely related to bear density. In a low density, expanding population in Scandinavia, one-third to half the females dispersed,settling 15 km from the natal range, on average, and 80-90% of males dispersed, generally settling over 100 km and up to nearly 500 km away. Seasonal movements are common for both sexes. In mountainous terrain, regular seasonal altitudinalshifts correspond with changing food conditions at different elevations and habitats. Lateral movements to seasonally abundant food sources may involve large numbers of bears traveling along well-worn routes, akin to a migration. Movements to fall feeding areas, followed by returns to denning sites, are often direct and rapid: travels exceeding 20 km in twelve hours have been recorded. At rich feeding areas, such as salmon streams, females with cubs avoid places with a high density of males, apparently because of threats of infanticide.",,"Active diurnally in North America, except where human activity is high.

At rich feeding areas, such as salmon streams, females with cubs avoid places with a high density of males, apparently because of threats of infanticide. Breeding. Mating is promiscuous, and generally occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Within individual populations, the breeding period in any given yearis narrower, typically about one month. Estrus can be as brief as one day to as long as a month, and male-female pairings can last from just a few hoursto three weeks. Copulation generally lasts 10-40 minutes, and induces ovulation. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until six to eight weeks prior to birthing, which usually occurs in January or February, while the mother is hibernating in a secluded den. Food conditions, especially the proportion of meat (particularly salmon) in the diet, largely affect reproductive rates. Average age offirst birthing varies among populations from fourto ten years, and average litter size varies from 1-3-2-5 cubs. Maximum littersize is five. Inter-birth intervals are as short as two years in some European populations, more typically three years and sometimes more than four years in North America, and averages 5-7 years in a high altitude population in Pakistan . Extended litter intervals result from mothers spending extra time to raise cubs in poorer habitats. Offspring generally remain with the mother until she breeds; however, where inter-birth intervals are greatly extended, mothers may recoup for a year or more without offspring. Females continue to produce cubs until their mid to late 20s, but may live another ten years after that.","Only populations in central Asia ( Mongolia to the Himalayas, China , Nepal , Bhutan ) fall under CITES Appendix I; all others are CITES Appendix II. The species as a whole is not considered threatened by The IUCN Red List (Least Concern), but some individual European populations are separately red-listed (Vulnerable-Critically Endangered), and other threatened populations will be added in the near future. These small populations tend to exist in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development, which act as mortality sinks. Forty-seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia are inhabited by Brown Bears. During the past 500 years they have been extirpated from 17 other countries, including large parts of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Mexico . In the lower 48 states of the USA , they were exterminated from more than 98% of their original range within 100 years of the arrival of European settlers, and have not since recovered. The total world population is estimated to exceed 200,000. Fairly reliable population estimates exist for several areas in North America ( USA 33,000; Canada 25,000) and Europe (14,000, excluding Russia ), but for few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000. The species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, but smaller, fragmented populations exist farther south. Populations are sufficiently large to sustain legal hunting in Russia , several former Soviet Republics, Japan ( Hokkaido Island), Canada , Alaska ( USA ), and several European countries. Conversely, populations with fewer than 100 individuals exist along the USA-Canadian border and in southern Europe where several small, isolated populations persist: two in the Pyrenees ( France and Spain ), one with less than 10 bears and the other with about 20, two populations in the Cantabrian Mountains ( Spain ) containing 20-30 and 80-100 bears, a population in the Appenine Mountains ( Italy ) with 40-50 bears, and in the the Alps ( Italy , Austria , and Slovenia ) with 35-40 bears. Small, disconnected populations are also scattered across southern Asia, and in some areas even the present existence of this species is unknown ( Bhutan , Iraq ). As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with human-related foods, where they may threaten life and damage property (livestock, cropfields) and may be killed as a consequence. Small numbers of mortalities, especially adult females, can threaten the viability of small, isolated populations. Most small populations are legally protected by national laws and international agreements, but with varying degrees of enforcement. Moreover, even where hunting is banned, other sorts of human-caused mortality (management removals, self-defense, malicious killing, poaching, mistaken hunting of Black Bear) dominate the population dynamics of these bears. Reintroductions and population augmentations have helped to restore numbers and expand geographic range in the USA and Western Europe. Numerous protected areas around the world have Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a self-sustaining population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses.

In Russia , following seasons with very poor food, large numbers of malnourished bears may wander about for much of the winter. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Individual home range sizes vary by nearly four orders of magnitude (7-30,000 km?), related to food supply and bear density. Home ranges are largest in the barren-ground Arctic tundra, averaging 8000 km ? for males. Rangesizes are smaller in boreal or montane forests, where large mammals are a main dietary component, and smaller yet in deciduous or mixed forests with hard mast. In coastal areas, with abundant food and high bear density, home ranges are smallest, averaging less than 200 km ” for males and less than 100 km ? for females. Male home ranges are typically three to four times larger than those of females; both sexes increase their ranges during the mating season to maximize overlap with potential mates. Bear density and home range overlap are high in coastal populations with abundant and predictable food (spawning salmon). In interior populations, with less abundant or more variable food, home ranges overlap less, and bears may be somewhat territorial. In extreme northern populations, where food resources are scarce, home ranges are large and indefensible, so overlap is high. Home range overlap is also positively associated with relatedness, because female offspring often settle near their mother, assuming part of their natal home range. Multigenerational, matrilineal assemblages occur in established populations, whereas females may be more prone to disperse and settle among unrelated individuals in expanding populations. Males disperse in either case, but their dispersal age (1-4 years old) is related to their growth rate, and dispersal distance is inversely related to bear density. In a low density, expanding population in Scandinavia, one-third to half the females dispersed,settling 15 km from the natal range, on average, and 80-90% of males dispersed, generally settling over 100 km and up to nearly 500 km away. Seasonal movements are common for both sexes. In mountainous terrain, regular seasonal altitudinalshifts correspond with changing food conditions at different elevations and habitats. Lateral movements to seasonally abundant food sources may involve large numbers of bears traveling along well-worn routes, akin to a migration. Movements to fall feeding areas, followed by returns to denning sites, are often direct and rapid: travels exceeding 20 km in twelve hours have been recorded. At rich feeding areas, such as salmon streams, females with cubs avoid places with a high density of males, apparently because of threats of infanticide. Breeding. Mating is promiscuous, and generally occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Within individual populations, the breeding period in any given yearis narrower, typically about one month. Estrus can be as brief as one day to as long as a month, and male-female pairings can last from just a few hoursto three weeks. Copulation generally lasts 10-40 minutes, and induces ovulation. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until six to eight weeks prior to birthing, which usually occurs in January or February, while the mother is hibernating in a secluded den. Food conditions, especially the proportion of meat (particularly salmon) in the diet, largely affect reproductive rates. Average age offirst birthing varies among populations from fourto ten years, and average litter size varies from 1-3-2-5 cubs. Maximum littersize is five. Inter-birth intervals are as short as two years in some European populations, more typically three years and sometimes more than four years in North America, and averages 5-7 years in a high altitude population in Pakistan . Extended litter intervals result from mothers spending extra time to raise cubs in poorer habitats. Offspring generally remain with the mother until she breeds; however, where inter-birth intervals are greatly extended, mothers may recoup for a year or more without offspring. Females continue to produce cubs until their mid to late 20s, but may live another ten years after that. Status and Conservation. Only populations in central Asia ( Mongolia to the Himalayas, China , Nepal , Bhutan ) fall under CITES Appendix I; all others are CITES Appendix II. The species as a whole is not considered threatened by The IUCN Red List (Least Concern), but some individual European populations are separately red-listed (Vulnerable-Critically Endangered), and other threatened populations will be added in the near future. These small populations tend to exist in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development, which act as mortality sinks. Forty-seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia are inhabited by Brown Bears. During the past 500 years they have been extirpated from 17 other countries, including large parts of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Mexico . In the lower 48 states of the USA , they were exterminated from more than 98% of their original range within 100 years of the arrival of European settlers, and have not since recovered. The total world population is estimated to exceed 200,000. Fairly reliable population estimates exist for several areas in North America ( USA 33,000; Canada 25,000) and Europe (14,000, excluding Russia ), but for few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000. The species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, but smaller, fragmented populations exist farther south. Populations are sufficiently large to sustain legal hunting in Russia , several former Soviet Republics, Japan ( Hokkaido Island), Canada , Alaska ( USA ), and several European countries. Conversely, populations with fewer than 100 individuals exist along the USA-Canadian border and in southern Europe where several small, isolated populations persist: two in the Pyrenees ( France and Spain ), one with less than 10 bears and the other with about 20, two populations in the Cantabrian Mountains ( Spain ) containing 20-30 and 80-100 bears, a population in the Appenine Mountains ( Italy ) with 40-50 bears, and in the the Alps ( Italy , Austria , and Slovenia ) with 35-40 bears. Small, disconnected populations are also scattered across southern Asia, and in some areas even the present existence of this species is unknown ( Bhutan , Iraq ). As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with human-related foods, where they may threaten life and damage property (livestock, cropfields) and may be killed as a consequence. Small numbers of mortalities, especially adult females, can threaten the viability of small, isolated populations. Most small populations are legally protected by national laws and international agreements, but with varying degrees of enforcement. Moreover, even where hunting is banned, other sorts of human-caused mortality (management removals, self-defense, malicious killing, poaching, mistaken hunting of Black Bear) dominate the population dynamics of these bears. Reintroductions and population augmentations have helped to restore numbers and expand geographic range in the USA and Western Europe. Numerous protected areas around the world have Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a self-sustaining population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses.

Males are heavier than females, but the degree of sexual dimorphism (10-20%) is less than most other bears. The Bornean subspeciesis notably smaller, with a maximum weight of 65 kg . The body is stocky, and compared to other bears, the front legs more bowed, front feet turned more inward, muzzle shortened, ears especially small, and hair very short, often with obvious whorls. Coat coloris black or less commonly dark brown, typically with a prominent white, yellow, or orange chest marking. The chest marking is highly variable among individuals, usually a U or circular shape, but occasionally more amorphous, and sometimes with dark patches or spots. The bear takes its common name from this marking, which may look like a sun. The muzzle is pale, and the forehead may be wrinkled. The exceptionally long tongue (20-25 cm) is used for feeding on insects and honey. The canine teeth, which are particularly large in relation to the head, and the large front feet with long claws, are used for breaking into wood (e.g. to prey on stingless bees) and termite colonies. Soles of the feet have little hair.","In mainland South-east Asia, where there is a prolonged dry season, Sun Bears inhabit semi-evergreen, mixed deciduous, dry dipterocarp, and montane evergreen forest, largely sympatric with Asiatic Black Bears. In Borneo, Sumatra, and peninsular Malaysia , areas with high rainfall throughout the year, they inhabit mainly tropical evergreen dipterocarp rainforest and peat swamps. They also use mangrove forest and oil palm plantations in proximity to other, more favored habitats. They occur from near sea level to over 2100 m elevation, but are most common in lower elevation forests.","Omnivorous diet includes insects (over 100 species, mainly termites, ants, beetles and bees), honey, and a wide variety of fruits. In Bornean forests, fruits of the families Moraceae (figs), Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet, but consumption of fruits from at least 20 other families of trees and lianas were identified in just one small study site ( 100 km ?) in East Kalimantan. Availability of foods varies markedly from masting years when most species fruit synchronously, to inter-masting years when little fruit is available and the bears turn mainly to insects. Figs ( Ficus ) are a staple food during inter-mast periods. On the mainland, fruiting is more uniform (predictable) from year to year, but varies seasonally. However, there is an enormous diversity of fruits, so some fruit is available at all times of year. In Thailand , about 40 families of trees are climbed by Sun Bears, mostly for food; fruits from Lauraceae (cinnamon) and Fagaceae (oak) are favorites. Sun Bears are especially known for preying on colonies of stingless bees (7Trigona), including their resinous nesting material. The bees form nests in cavities of live trees, so to prey on them Sun Bears chew and claw through the tree, leaving a conspicuous hole. These bears consume little vegetative matter, although they seem to relish the growth shoots of palm trees (palm hearts), the consumption of which kills the tree. Occasionally they also take reptiles, small mammals, and bird eggs. Activity patterns. Activity has been described as mainly nocturnal or mainly diurnal. This variability depends on proximity to human activities: in heavily disturbed areas, such as oil palm plantations, Sun Bears are chiefly nocturnal. Camera traps along roads typically obtain photographs of bears mainly at night, whereas signals from radio-collared bears farther from roads indicate that they are active mainly during the day. They spend a large proportion of time feeding in trees when fruit is abundant. They also sometimes build tree nests of branches and leaves for sleeping. This behavior has been attributed to previous predation pressure by Tigers; however,it appears to occur commonly only in heavily-disturbed forests or near people. Sun Bears have been observed to slide rapidly down tree trunks when disturbed by people. Although arboreally adept, they cannot swing orjump from tree to tree. Normally they sleep on the ground, often in cavities of either standing or fallen trees, or under such trees. Females use similar sites for birthing dens. This species does not hibernate. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Home range information is very limited. Two males radio-tracked for about one year in Borneo during a fruiting failure had minimum known ranges of 15-20 km?

Two Bornean females living in a small, isolated forest patch ( 100 km ? more than half of which had been burned in a forest fire and was rarely used by Sun Bears) had home ranges of only about 4 km ®.

This is the only species of bear without an obvious breeding and birthing season. Cubs are born during all months, both in captivity and in the wild. However, data have not been collected across the range, so it is possible that greater reproductive seasonality occurs in areas with strongly seasonal environments. Females have four teats, but maximum observed litter size is two, and normal litter size is only one. Captive-born cubs have shown an unusual female bias. The gestation period in captivity is much shorter than in other bears: it is normally 3-3-5 months (indicating a shortened or nonexistent period of delayed implantation), but in a few odd cases stretched to 6-8 months, like most other bears. Mating in captivity occurs at 3-6 month intervals if pregnancy does not result. If cubs die, estrus reoccurs in 2-5 weeks, making the interbirth interval as short as 4-4-5 months. No information is available on normal cub dependency or intervals between litters in the wild. The earliest known age of estrus in the wild is three years old. Birthing takes place in a secluded den. In captivity, mothers sometimes carry their cub in their mouth, suggesting that bears in the wild may be able to move dens occasionally after the cub is born.","CITES Appendix I.

Additionally, it is strictly protected under national wildlife laws throughout its range; however, there is generally insufficient enforcement of these laws. None of the eleven countries where the Sun Bear occurs has implemented any conservation measures specifically for this species. Commercial poaching, especially for gall bladders (used in traditional Chinese medicine) and paws (a delicacy), is a considerable threat, especially in mainland South-east Asia. Local hunters in one area of Thailand estimated that commercial poaching reduced the abundance of Sun Bears by 50% in 20 years. In Malaysia and Indonesia , deforestation is the prime threat.

No subspecies have been designated, but substantial variation exists in color patterns within different portions of the range.

The extent of white markings is highly variable. Individuals with complete white circles around both eyes gave rise to the common name Spectacled Bear. However, many if not most do not have complete circles around both eyes; some have partial circles, some are highly asymmetrical, and some have virtually no facial markings or, conversely, an almost all buff-white face. The muzzle is variably-colored and short compared to the ursine bears. Claws are short on both front and rear feet. The underside of the feet have hair between the digital and plantar pads, but not between the plantar and carpal front pads (similar to Asiatic Black Bears).","Andean Bears range in elevation from 200 to over 4700 m . Preferred habitat includes various sorts of humid and very humid montane cloud forest. They also occupy higher elevation elfin forest, and puna and paramo (high-altitude) grasslands, as well as lower elevation thorn forest and scrub desert (in western Peru ).","Omnivorous diet includes many kinds of fruits, vegetative material, and meat. Especially important through most parts of the range are the succulent parts of plants in the family Bromeliaceae , both epiphytic and terrestrial bromeliads. In high altitude grasslands, the heart of the terrestrial Puya is a dietary mainstay, as this bromeliad is the only abundant food available for much of the year. The bears must strip away the stiff thorny leaves to get to the heart, which looks somewhat like a pineapple but is vegetative and bland. Bears may eat only one in ten of this obiquitous plant, possibly related to differences in nutritional composition. In the forest, they regularly climb trees to obtain Tillandsia , an epiphytic bromeliad; they eat the basal meristematic tissue and drop the remaining pieces of leaves to the forest floor, providing a highly visible sign of their feeding activity. Bears select patches (with Puya ) or trees (with Tillandsia ) that have a high density of large bromeliads. Bromeliads compose from 90% to less than 15% of their diet, depending on season and geographic area. Fruits compose the other core part of the diet, varying inversely to the bromeliads. Both shrub and tree-borne fruits are consumed (e.g. Lauraceae , Moraceae , Ericaceae , Euphorbiaceae ). Fruit abundance varies seasonally with rainfall. Other foods include palm petioles, bamboo shoots, bulbs of orchids, and in drier habitats, fruits and pulp of cacti and, remarkably, the soft cortex of the pasallo tree (Bombax discolor). Near human settlements, they routinely raid cornfields. Animal matter is another potentially important food, although never a large dietary component. They eat insects, snails, and small mammals, but more significantly in terms of total nutrition, they occasionally take large mammals such as deer and free-ranging or unguarded pastured cattle. Considerable controversy has surrounded the issue of whether most meat in their diet is from animals that they killed or scavenged—there is clear evidence that they sometimes prey on cattle, but they probably also find carrion. A test of their attraction to beef demonstrated this: a small (0-5 kg) chunk of meat placed in an open area attracted two different radio-collared bears from a distance of 1-5 km in 5-15 hours. When feeding on a cattle carcass, which may take several days to consume, they often construct ground and tree nests for resting. Tree nests are made from a collection of bent and broken branches. They also sometimes build nests in fruit trees. Activity patterns. In one high-elevation site in Bolivia , composed of mixed grassland and cloud forest, Andean Bears were entirely diurnal.

No subspecies have been designated, but substantial variation exists in color patterns within different portions of the range. Recent genetic examination in the northern part of the range indicates that gene flow is extremely low (populations are isolated), and that this situation predates the invasion of Europeans (i.e. it is not human-caused). Monotypic. Distribution. Andes Mountains of Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru and Boliva, with controversial evidence of existence in N Argentina . Descriptive notes. Head-body 130-190 cm, tail less than 10 cm ; weight of males 100-175 kg (rarely to 200 kg ), females 60-80 kg. Coatis black or sometimes dark brown with creamy white biblike marking on chin, neck, and/or chest and typically some white markings around the muzzle and eyes. The extent of white markings is highly variable. Individuals with complete white circles around both eyes gave rise to the common name Spectacled Bear. However, many if not most do not have complete circles around both eyes; some have partial circles, some are highly asymmetrical, and some have virtually no facial markings or, conversely, an almost all buff-white face. The muzzle is variably-colored and short compared to the ursine bears. Claws are short on both front and rear feet. The underside of the feet have hair between the digital and plantar pads, but not between the plantar and carpal front pads (similar to Asiatic Black Bears). Habitat. Andean Bears range in elevation from 200 to over 4700 m . Preferred habitat includes various sorts of humid and very humid montane cloud forest. They also occupy higher elevation elfin forest, and puna and paramo (high-altitude) grasslands, as well as lower elevation thorn forest and scrub desert (in western Peru ). Food and Feeding. Omnivorous diet includes many kinds of fruits, vegetative material, and meat. Especially important through most parts of the range are the succulent parts of plants in the family Bromeliaceae , both epiphytic and terrestrial bromeliads. In high altitude grasslands, the heart of the terrestrial Puya is a dietary mainstay, as this bromeliad is the only abundant food available for much of the year. The bears must strip away the stiff thorny leaves to get to the heart, which looks somewhat like a pineapple but is vegetative and bland. Bears may eat only one in ten of this obiquitous plant, possibly related to differences in nutritional composition. In the forest, they regularly climb trees to obtain Tillandsia , an epiphytic bromeliad; they eat the basal meristematic tissue and drop the remaining pieces of leaves to the forest floor, providing a highly visible sign of their feeding activity. Bears select patches (with Puya ) or trees (with Tillandsia ) that have a high density of large bromeliads. Bromeliads compose from 90% to less than 15% of their diet, depending on season and geographic area. Fruits compose the other core part of the diet, varying inversely to the bromeliads. Both shrub and tree-borne fruits are consumed (e.g. Lauraceae , Moraceae , Ericaceae , Euphorbiaceae ). Fruit abundance varies seasonally with rainfall.

Stocky, barrel-shaped body, large forelimbs, wide massive head with short muzzle and erect ears ( 10 cm ). Hairs are coarse and oily. Specific name melanoleuca refers to distinctive black and white color pattern, which is unique among mammals. Face is white with an oblong black patch around each eye, black ears, and a black nose. Forelegs are black, continuing up over shoulders with a narrower band across the back. Hindlegs below the hips are also black. The remainder of the body, including the tail, is white. Occasionally, individuals may have more brown than black coloration. Forepaws are modified with a greatly enlarged radial sesamoid bone, which functions as a sixth digit for grasping bamboo. This “false thumb” is nearly equal in size to the metacarpal bones of the five true digits, and has its own pad that opposes the first digit, although it cannot be moved like an independent thumb. Bamboo is held within the haired furrow between the digits and plantar (palmar) pad, which can be tightly flexed. The Giant Panda’s generic name, meaning panda foot, derives from the foot’s likeness to the structure and function of the foot of the Red Panda, a bamboo-eater that was discovered and named earlier. Claws are short, both front and rear.","Occupy temperate montane forests with dense stands of bamboo at altitudes of 1200-4100m, or more typically 1500-3000m. Bamboo is a dominant understory plant in broad-leaved, broad-leaved mixed with conifer, and subalpine conifer forests in the mountainous regions of central China . However, the type and density of bamboo greatly affect habitat use by Giant Pandas. The growth rate of bamboo, and hence its suitability to Pandas,is also related to the amount of overstory tree canopy. Remaining habitat for Pandas is steep and rugged, being the only land that was not farmed and settled by people in a once-extensive range that extended from Beijing to eastern China and south to present day Vietnam and Myanmar . Within this remaining habitat, Pandas seek areas with relatively gentle slopes and high moisture.","Their diet is almost entirely bamboo (over 99%); however, they occasionally feed on leaves, stems or roots of other plants as well as some meat, from rodents and young ungulates, either killed or scavenged. During large-scale flowering and die-off of bamboo, individuals may seek other foods, including crops and human garbage. For unknown reasons, some individuals do this even when bamboo is readily available. Across the six mountain ranges that they inhabit, Giant Pandas utilize over 60 species of bamboo, 35 of which constitute their main food source. They select species higher in protein and lower in fiber, hence more digestible. They use different species of bamboo in different elevational bands, varying with the seasons and coinciding with the germination and growth of the plants. They eat different parts of bamboo at different times of year, alternating between young tender leaves and shoots, versus stems and branches. They prefer shoots and stems of certain lengths and diameters, selecting those that are easier to hold and chew. Pandas sit or recline to eat. Holding a stem in one paw, a Panda inserts it in the side of its mouth and repeatedly and rapidly bites off chunks approximately the width of its palate, chewing very little. Scats of any individual Panda thus have intact fragments of bamboo that are all approximately the same length. This characteristic has been exploited in population surveys, where the size of bamboo fragments in scats is used to differentiate individuals with overlapping home ranges. Activity patterns . Pandas are active about 50% of the day, mostly collecting or eating bamboo. Activity occurs rather uniformly through the day and night, in bursts of a few hours. Little variation occurs seasonally. Unlike other bears, which exhibit an energymaximizing strategy, increasing consumption and activity when food is most plentiful, Pandas are least active when feeding on abundant and nutritious leaves. Because food is available throughout the year, Pandas do not hibernate, although during cold and snowy conditions they may take temporary shelter in hollow trees, rock crevices, and caves. They climb trees, although infrequently, to escape danger, to rest, or in courtship—during the mating season males may vocalize from trees to attract females, and estrous females may climb to fend off suitors. However, they spend less time in trees than several other species of bears (Andean Bears, Sun Bears, Asiatic Black Bears) because they do not feed there. Movements, Home range and Social organization . Individuals have home ranges of 1-60 km?, averaging 5-15 km? depending on gender and habitat. Range size changes seasonally, and they make seasonal elevational shifts (sometimes referred to as vertical migrations), which vary by area, corresponding with growth patterns of various kinds of bamboo. Typically they descend to lower elevations during winter, to escape deep snow, and to high elevations in summer. They can move several hundred meters in elevation in just a few days. Home ranges overlap, but pandas may remain in smaller core areas of only about 30 ha for half their time; these core ranges overlap little among animals of the same sex, but adult males overlap the core ranges of several females. Communication and spacing appears to be maintained by extensive scent marking, using secretions from anogenital glands. Secretions are often deposited on stumps, logs or trees along prominent ridges. One study used fecal genetics to investigate relatedness of Pandas living in the same vicinity, and inferred that, unlike all other bears, females rather than males disperse from their natal area. In another study, two radio-collared males settled near their mother, whereas two young females dispersed. As Panda range has expanded, several young, apparently dispersing females have appeared in several new areas, including a large city.",,"Pandas are active about 50% of the day, mostly collecting or eating bamboo.

As Panda range has expanded, several young, apparently dispersing females have appeared in several new areas, including a large city. Breeding . Mating occurs from March through May. Vocalizations (bleating, chirping) and scent marking are used to attract mates. Pairs may remain together for days or weeks prior to mating. Both sexes may mate with multiple (3-5) partners. Peak estrus lasts less than one week. Females use rock dens or hollow trees for birthing. Cubs are born in August or September, 3-5-5 months after mating; a variable period of delayed implantation accounts for the variability in total gestation. At 80-200 grams, the infant at birth is only about 0-1% of the mother’s weight, one-third to one-quarter that of other bears. Infants are born pink in color, with short, sparse white hair; the typical black and white pelage is achieved by three weeks of age. Litter size at birth is often two, generally born about two hours (but up to 36 hours) apart; however, the mother raises just the first born, if it is healthy. Thus, functional litter size in the wild is only one. In captivity, females can be fooled into raising two cubs by switching them every twelve hours. This is the only species of bear to regularly give birth to more cubs than it can raise—the explanation for this unusual reproductive strategy remains elusive. Also, unusual for bears, Panda mothers change dens multiple times, carrying their cub in their mouth, and also periodically leave the den to feed. During the birthing process they only fast for 2-3 weeks. Pandas are often erroneously believed to be poor breeders. This impression stemmed from the previous low reproductive performance of captive animals, now known to have resulted from inadequate captive conditions. Studies of wild Pandas indicate that their reproductive rates are comparable to some other species of bears, with cub production beginning at 5-7 years and inter-litter intervals of two or three years. Breeding continues into the early-20s, so a female could wean six or more cubs in her lifetime.","CITES Appendix I. Listed as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Giant Panda is considered a threatened and precious species in China . They are also listed as Endangered under the USA Endangered Species Act, thereby regulating import of captive animals into the USA . Their total population in the wild has been estimated at less than 2000, but this may be revised as better methodology is developed for estimating numbers (e.g. using DNA in their feces to identify individuals). They are a Category I species (maximum level of protection) under the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Law. A national conservation plan, adopted by the Chinese government in 1992, guides conservation initiatives for this species. Intentional poaching of Pandas has been largely curtailed by severe penalties and increased patrolling in their remaining habitats. Markets for their skins have virtually disappeared, and other body parts are not used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, they are still sometimes killed in snares set for Musk Deer and other species. Limited and degraded habitat remains their greatest threat. The species only exists in portions of six mountain ranges separated by expanses of agriculture, and within these, inhabitable bamboo forests are separated by a patchwork of clearings and forested areas without bamboo. Conservation measures have included the establishment of a network of more than 60 Panda reserves, a ban on logging, and a policy that compensates farmers who convert agricultural fields on steep slopes to forest. However, small population size and restricted total range remains a threat to the viability of this species. A further threat relates to the panda’s reliance on bamboo for food. Bamboo is subject to periodic, synchronous flowering and dieoffs at intervals of 15-120 years, and the fragmented habitat restricts where Pandas can move when such die-offs occur. Effects of climate change on bamboo abundance and flowering cycles are as yet very uncertain. Captive breeding in China has now succeeded (with the aid of artificial insemination) to the extent that captive facilities will soon be overpopulated, providing a potential stock for augmenting wild Panda populations. However, the lack of suitable release sites—having adequate habitat but few resident pandas—Ilimits hopes of eventually releasing many of these captive Pandas into the wild.","Endo et al.

Because food is available throughout the year, Pandas do not hibernate, although during cold and snowy conditions they may take temporary shelter in hollow trees, rock crevices, and caves. They climb trees, although infrequently, to escape danger, to rest, or in courtship—during the mating season males may vocalize from trees to attract females, and estrous females may climb to fend off suitors. However, they spend less time in trees than several other species of bears (Andean Bears, Sun Bears, Asiatic Black Bears) because they do not feed there. Movements, Home range and Social organization . Individuals have home ranges of 1-60 km?, averaging 5-15 km? depending on gender and habitat. Range size changes seasonally, and they make seasonal elevational shifts (sometimes referred to as vertical migrations), which vary by area, corresponding with growth patterns of various kinds of bamboo. Typically they descend to lower elevations during winter, to escape deep snow, and to high elevations in summer. They can move several hundred meters in elevation in just a few days. Home ranges overlap, but pandas may remain in smaller core areas of only about 30 ha for half their time; these core ranges overlap little among animals of the same sex, but adult males overlap the core ranges of several females. Communication and spacing appears to be maintained by extensive scent marking, using secretions from anogenital glands. Secretions are often deposited on stumps, logs or trees along prominent ridges. One study used fecal genetics to investigate relatedness of Pandas living in the same vicinity, and inferred that, unlike all other bears, females rather than males disperse from their natal area. In another study, two radio-collared males settled near their mother, whereas two young females dispersed. As Panda range has expanded, several young, apparently dispersing females have appeared in several new areas, including a large city. Breeding . Mating occurs from March through May. Vocalizations (bleating, chirping) and scent marking are used to attract mates. Pairs may remain together for days or weeks prior to mating. Both sexes may mate with multiple (3-5) partners. Peak estrus lasts less than one week. Females use rock dens or hollow trees for birthing. Cubs are born in August or September, 3-5-5 months after mating; a variable period of delayed implantation accounts for the variability in total gestation. At 80-200 grams, the infant at birth is only about 0-1% of the mother’s weight, one-third to one-quarter that of other bears. Infants are born pink in color, with short, sparse white hair; the typical black and white pelage is achieved by three weeks of age. Litter size at birth is often two, generally born about two hours (but up to 36 hours) apart; however, the mother raises just the first born, if it is healthy. Thus, functional litter size in the wild is only one. In captivity, females can be fooled into raising two cubs by switching them every twelve hours. This is the only species of bear to regularly give birth to more cubs than it can raise—the explanation for this unusual reproductive strategy remains elusive. Also, unusual for bears, Panda mothers change dens multiple times, carrying their cub in their mouth, and also periodically leave the den to feed. During the birthing process they only fast for 2-3 weeks. Pandas are often erroneously believed to be poor breeders. This impression stemmed from the previous low reproductive performance of captive animals, now known to have resulted from inadequate captive conditions. Studies of wild Pandas indicate that their reproductive rates are comparable to some other species of bears, with cub production beginning at 5-7 years and inter-litter intervals of two or three years. Breeding continues into the early-20s, so a female could wean six or more cubs in her lifetime. Status and Conservation . CITES Appendix I. Listed as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Giant Panda is considered a threatened and precious species in China . They are also listed as Endangered under the USA Endangered Species Act, thereby regulating import of captive animals into the USA . Their total population in the wild has been estimated at less than 2000, but this may be revised as better methodology is developed for estimating numbers (e.g. using DNA in their feces to identify individuals). They are a Category I species (maximum level of protection) under the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Law. A national conservation plan, adopted by the Chinese government in 1992, guides conservation initiatives for this species. Intentional poaching of Pandas has been largely curtailed by severe penalties and increased patrolling in their remaining habitats. Markets for their skins have virtually disappeared, and other body parts are not used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, they are still sometimes killed in snares set for Musk Deer and other species. Limited and degraded habitat remains their greatest threat. The species only exists in portions of six mountain ranges separated by expanses of agriculture, and within these, inhabitable bamboo forests are separated by a patchwork of clearings and forested areas without bamboo. Conservation measures have included the establishment of a network of more than 60 Panda reserves, a ban on logging, and a policy that compensates farmers who convert agricultural fields on steep slopes to forest. However, small population size and restricted total range remains a threat to the viability of this species. A further threat relates to the panda’s reliance on bamboo for food. Bamboo is subject to periodic, synchronous flowering and dieoffs at intervals of 15-120 years, and the fragmented habitat restricts where Pandas can move when such die-offs occur. Effects of climate change on bamboo abundance and flowering cycles are as yet very uncertain. Captive breeding in China has now succeeded (with the aid of artificial insemination) to the extent that captive facilities will soon be overpopulated, providing a potential stock for augmenting wild Panda populations. However, the lack of suitable release sites—having adequate habitat but few resident pandas—Ilimits hopes of eventually releasing many of these captive Pandas into the wild. Bibliography .

Weights vary regionally and seasonally, adult males are heavier (60-225 kg, rarely up to 400 kg ) than adult females (40-150 kg, but occasionally more than 180 kg ). Straight facial profile, from forehead to nose, distinguishes this species from the partially sympatric Brown (Grizzly) Bear. Muzzle color is usually tan, with short hairs. Sometimes a small tan circular mark occurs slightly above each eye. Eyes are often blue at birth, but turn brown during the first year. Body hairs are rather uniform in length, but much sparser ventrally. A thick underfur is grown in fall, and molted in late spring. Coat color varies from uniformly black to various shades of brown, including cinnamon (reddish-brown) and blond. Brown-phase American Black Bears are common in western USA , less common in western Canadian Provinces, and rare along the west coast of Canada , across Alaska, and in eastern North America and Mexico . Rare white-colored (non-albino) bears occur in coastal British Columbia and gray (often called blue) bears occur in south-east Alaska. White chest markings, from one or more small spots to a large crescent-shaped blaze, occur to varying degrees, but in most populations are uncommon (except in cubs). Claws are short. Hair separates the digital pads from the main foot pad on the front and rear feet. There is also hair between the front (palmar) foot pad and carpal pad, which in normal walking does not touch the ground. Foot pads are shed in winter, when bears are in dens.","Found primarily in temperate and boreal forests, but also range into subtropical areas (Florida and Mexico ) as well as into the subarctic. They inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the Grizzly Bear). They tend to occupy more forested habitats than the Grizzly Bear, especially where the two species are sympatric. Elevationally they range from sea level to 3000 m , and up to 3500 m for winter denning.","American Black Bears are generalist, opportunistic omnivores with diets varying seasonally from herbaceous vegetation (mainly in spring) to roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion. They are also attracted to human-related foods, including garbage, birdseed, corn, oats, apples, honey and brood in apiaries. Feeding increases dramatically in the fall, in preparation for hibernation, and focuses on foods rich in fat. American chestnuts ( Castanea dentata) were once a key fall food in eastern North America, but after blight destroyed this food source in the early to mid-1900s, oak ( Quercus ) acorns and beechnuts ( Fagus grandifolia) became the main fall foods. Farther west, hazelnuts (Corylus), whitebark pine nuts (Pinus albicaulis), madrone ( Arbutus xalapensis), mansanita ( Arctostaphylos ), huckleberries ( Vaccinium ), and buffalo berries (Shepherdia canadensis) are principalfall foods. In arid regions, succulents such as yucca and cacti are important, especially during droughts. Activity patterns. Mainly diurnal, commonly with an early morning and evening peak in activity and a lull in midday. They tend to sleep through the night, but nocturnal activity may increase during fall, especially in places with clumped, abundant foods. It has been theorized that gut capacity and passage rates of food may limit the length of feeding bouts when intake rates are high, prompting more uniform feeding throughout the day. Alternately, or additionally, large weight gains in fall may pose energetic constraints on feeding. More nocturnal activity also occurs when feeding in areas near human activity. Total time active per day averages 50-60%, but may be less when abundant human-related foods are available. Virtually no activity occurs for the 3-7 months of winter hibernation. In some southern portions of the range, where food is available year-round, only parturient females and those with cubs from the previous year hibernate. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Home range sizes vary widely, from 3—- 1100 km ? among individuals, and from 5-500 km ?* among population means. In one unusual case on the tundra of Labrador, Canada , where food supplies were especially sparse, males ranged over 7000 km *, much like Brown Bears in similar environments. Home ranges are compressed where and when food is abundant, and where bear density is high. Likewise, overlap among home ranges tends to be greater where food abundance and bear density are high. Male home ranges are 2-10 times larger than those of females. Males thus overlap a number of potential breeding partners. In some areas, females (but not males) appear to be territorial, with portions of their home range not shared by other females. Female offspring remain within their natal range for a few years, gaining continued protection from the presence of their mother, and gradually expand their range to include other areas and less of their mother’s range as they age. Males, when 1-4 years old, disperse from the natal range. Dispersal distances vary from less than 10 to more than 200 km ; dispersers may travel more than 40 km in a week. Seasonal movements, especially to fall mast areas, are common for both sexes, although again, males move farther. In mountainous areas,shifts occur elevationally in accordance with changing food conditions; in flatter terrain, fall movements of 20 km to more than 50 km are not unusual, with greater movements in years when food supplies are particularly sparse. Single-day movements of more than 20 km have been reported.

Implantation of the blastocyst occurs in November and birthing in January or February (occasionally December) while the mother is hibernating. Cubs are born highly altricial, weighing 200-450 g, 20 cm in length, eyes closed and nearly hairless. Females give birth beginning at age 3-8 years, depending on food availability and hence their growth rate, and can produce cubs every other year until their mid-to-late 20s. Mothers and cubs leave the birthing den when cubs are 2-:5-3-5 months old. They readily climb trees as a refuge when the mother is off feeding, sometimes several kilometers away. They nurse until autumn, but increasingly consume wild foods beginning in late spring. They den with their mother over their first birthday, and remain with her for 16-17 months. Family breakup is usually instigated by the mother’s breeding activity. Where food is less abundant, the interbirth interval may be prolonged to three or more years, enabling a period of recovery without cubs. Litter sizes range from 1-5, averaging 2-5 cubs in eastern North America and 2-0 in western North America, and tend to be slightly male-biased.","Not globally threatened, listed as Least Concern by The IUCN Red Lust, but is listed on Appendix II of CITES under the similarity of appearance provision; this mandates tagging of exported parts legally taken by hunters, so they cannot be confused with parts from illegally taken bears ofother species. With a total population estimated at about 900,000, American Black Bears are more than twice as abundant as all other species of bears combined, even though they exist in only three countries in North America ( Canada , USA , Mexico ). Continent-wide, numbers appear to be increasing by about 2% per year, and more than 60% of USA states and Canadian provinces report increasing populations. Approximately 40,000-50,000 are harvested annually by sport hunters in 28 USA states and twelve Canadian provinces and territories. In Mexico , no hunting is allowed, and the species is considered nationally endangered, but appears to be increasing and expanding its range.

Where food is less abundant, the interbirth interval may be prolonged to three or more years, enabling a period of recovery without cubs. Litter sizes range from 1-5, averaging 2-5 cubs in eastern North America and 2-0 in western North America, and tend to be slightly male-biased. Status and Conservation. Not globally threatened, listed as Least Concern by The IUCN Red Lust, but is listed on Appendix II of CITES under the similarity of appearance provision; this mandates tagging of exported parts legally taken by hunters, so they cannot be confused with parts from illegally taken bears ofother species. With a total population estimated at about 900,000, American Black Bears are more than twice as abundant as all other species of bears combined, even though they exist in only three countries in North America ( Canada , USA , Mexico ). Continent-wide, numbers appear to be increasing by about 2% per year, and more than 60% of USA states and Canadian provinces report increasing populations. Approximately 40,000-50,000 are harvested annually by sport hunters in 28 USA states and twelve Canadian provinces and territories. In Mexico , no hunting is allowed, and the species is considered nationally endangered, but appears to be increasing and expanding its range. The Louisiana subspecies (luteolus) was listed as threatened under the USA Endangered Species Act because of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality. U. a. floridanusis listed as threatened by the state ofFlorida. The Kermode Bear (kermodei) or “spirit bear”, a white-phase American Black Bear, was selected as the official provincial mammal of British Columbia, and provided the inspiration for a large system of protected areas (Great Bear Rainforest Agreement) where logging in coastal temperate rainforest is severely restricted.

This species also occupies arid subtropical thorn-forests (southern Iran and Pakistan ) and seasonally uses alpine meadows.

In some areas, mammalian ungulates (especially smallbodied species) may compose a sizeable portion of the diet; however, these bears rarely eat fish. Asiatic Black Bears regularly climb trees to obtain fruits, because most fruits in their range are tree-borne. In tropical regions fruit diversity is especially high. For example, in Thailand their diet includes over 80 species of tree-borne fruits, commonly including those in the cinnamon ( Lauraceae ), pea-bean (Leguminosae), mahogany ( Meliaceae ), and oak-beech-chestnut ( Fagaceae ) families. In temperate regions, where they must store fat for hibernation, hard mast, such as oak acorns, beechnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, and pine nuts, is a key fall dietary component. When feeding in hard mast trees they often break branches inward toward the trunk and pile them up in the canopy forming a platform or “nest” upon which they sit. When natural forest foods are lacking, they feed in agricultural fields (corn, oats, millet, barley, buckwheat) and fruit orchards. In plantations, when food supplies are short, they strip bark and eat cambium of conifer trees, damaging the trees. Activity patterns. Active diurnally most of the year, often with peak activity periods in morning and evening. More uniformly active, day and night, during the fall, when foods are clumped and abundant. Overall level of activity may vary seasonally, but is generally in the range of 50-60% over a 24hour period. In northern latitudes, where food becomes unavailable in winter, both sexes hibernate. They typically den November—April, but some remain in dens until the end of May (which is later than other species of bears). In the tropics, except for females giving birth during the winter, Asiatic Black Bears generally do not hibernate. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Most reported home ranges based on ground radio-tracking are 20-60 km” for adult females and twice as large for males. However, tracking is often done in remote, mountainous habitats, and bears sometimes wander beyond the tracking area, so true home ranges are likely larger than reported.

Breeding generally occurs duringJune—July and birthing during November— March; however, timing of reproduction is not known for all portions of the range, especially in the tropics. The full gestation period of 6-8 months includes 4-6 months of delayed implantation. Age offirst reproduction is typically 4-5 years for both sexes. Modallitter size is two cubs (range 1-3, rarely four), but the average is less than two, produced at most every two years.","CITES Appendix I. Listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The so-called Baluchistan Bear (U. t. gedrosianus), living in south-eastern Iran , and southern Pakistan , is listed as Endangered under the USA Endangered Species Act. Reliable population estimates do not exist anywhere in the range; however, two of 18 range countries estimate total populations of less than 100 ( Iran , South Korea ), whereas at the other extreme, three countries estimate populations of 5000-15,000 ( India , Japan , Russia ) and one ( China ) estimates more than 20,000 Asiatic Black Bears. Most countries report declining populations due to habitat loss and poaching. Habitat loss from logging, agriculture, human settlements, roadways, and erosion is most severe in southern portions of the range. The species is protected throughout its range by national and international laws. Sport hunting for Asiatic Black Bears is legal only in Japan and Russia , with annual harvests of about 500 and 100 bears, respectively; however, illegalkills and nuisance kills exceed hunting kills by a factor of five or more in both countries. Bear depredations on crops and apiaries, and attacks on people, have increased throughout the range, and have led to more direct killing, using guns, poisons, and bombs that explode when bitten. Poaching also appears to be increasing, spurred by commercial demands for meat,skins, paws, and gall bladders. The demand for these products has fueled a growing network of international trade throughout South-east Asia, and has encouraged many subsistence hunters to turn to commercial hunting. Paws are sold as an expensive delicacy (made into a soup), especially in China . Bile in gall bladdersis dried and sold as a traditional Chinese medicine; it has been used as such for nearly 3000 years. To supply an increasing demand, bear farms have been established in China and Vietnam , where bile is drained from over 12,000 Asiatic Black Bears and sold commercially. This technique was originally developed in North Korea in the 1970s, and “perfected” over the years in China . Some officials assert that the increased production of bile from farming reduces poaching of wild bears; conversely, the cheaper and more available farmed bile also may encourage more use, and thus ultimately more demand for wild bile, which is considered more potent. Farmed bile is now produced in such surplus that it is incorporated into many non-traditional Chinese medicine products, such as shampoos, lotions, cosmetics, sports drinks, and toothpaste. Prompted by animal welfare-related concerns, several hundred bears have been removed from farms and taken to rescue facilities run by non-governmental organizations. However, the large total number of captive, non-releasable bears and the opinion of government officials that farming aids in the conservation of wild bears, make the situation rather intractable.","Bromlei (1965) | Carr et al.

M. u. inornatus Pucheran, 1855 — Sri Lanka .","Head-body 140-190 cm, tail 8-17 cm; weight of males 70-145 kg (rarely to 190 kg ), females 50-95 kg (rarely to 120 kg ). The Sri Lankan subspecies is smaller, and with a less-shaggy (shorter, sparser) coat than the nominate subspecies. Coat color is black, with rare brown or reddish-brown individuals. Hair length tends to be longer than in other bears, especially around the neck, shoulders, and back (up to 15-20 cm). The ears are also covered with long hair. Underfur is lacking, and ventral body hair is sparse. The muzzle has very short hair, and is distinctly light-colored up to the eyes. The lips are highly protrusible (hence this bear is sometimes called the Lip Bear), adapted for sucking termites, and the nose can be closed during such sucking, by pushing it against the side of the feeding excavation. The chest is normally marked by a prominent white V or U-shaped band. Sloth Bears have long (6-8 cm) slightly curved, ivory-colored front claws (for digging), and shorter rear claws. The long front claws (along with their coarse, shaggy coat and missing two upper incisors) are what seem to have caused an early taxonomist to call it a sloth. Soles of the feet are naked; unlike other bears, there is no hair between the digital pads and plantar pad on front and hindfeet, and also no hair separating the carpal and plantar (palmar) pad on the front. Unique among the bears, the digital pads are partially fused and are in a nearly straight line.","Occupies a wide range of habitats on the Indian subcontinent, including wet and dry tropical forests, savannas, scrublands, and grasslands. Densities are highest in alluvial grasslands, and second-highest in moist or dry deciduous forests. Characteristically a lowland species, mainly limited to habitats below 1500 m , but ranges up to 2000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats, India . In Sri Lanka ,it inhabits dry monsoon forests below 300 m . The climate throughout the range is monsoonal, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. This causes some variation in food habits and habitat use: very dry or very wet conditions can hamper feeding on termite colonies.","Sloth Bears are both myrmecophagous and frugivorous. Ants, termites, and fruit dominate their diet, with proportions varying seasonally and regionally. Fruits (from at least ten families of trees and shrubs) constitute up to 90% of the diet during the fruiting season in southern India and 70% in Sri Lanka , but less than 40% in Nepal , where fewerfruits are available. Sloth Bears more often eat fallen fruits off the ground than climb to eatfruits in trees. However, they will readily climb to consume honey. During the non-fruiting season, insects make up 95% of the diet in Nepal and 75-80% in S India and Sri Lanka . The relative proportion of termites to ants in the diet also varies considerably by region; in Nepal and Sri Lanka this ratio 1s more than 2:1, whereas in central India the ratio varies from about 1:1 to 1:5, favoring ants. Sloth Bears feed on termites by digging into their mounds or underground colonies, then alternately sucking up the termites and blowing away debris. These distinctive “vacuuming” sounds can be heard from 200 m away. Although most of their diggings are less than 60 cm deep, they occasionally dig down 1-2 m. Sloth Bears typically eat little vegetative matter other than fruits and some flowers, and they rarely prey on mammals or eat carrion. However, where their habitat is severely degraded by intensive human use and most of their normal foods are not available, they feed heavily on cultivated fruits and agricultural crops such as peanuts, corn, potatoes, and yams. Activity patterns. These bears are more nocturnal than other bears, likely a response to the heat and sparse cover of their environment. Overall amount of activity varies widely, from 40-70% of the 24hour day, depending on conditions. In a national park in Nepal , with dense cover and moderate temperatures, most Sloth Bears are active both day and night, but are more active at night; conversely, subadults and females with cubs are diurnal, possibly to avoid being killed by nocturnal predators (Tigers) and other bears. In a park in Sri Lanka , with higher temperatures but dense cover, the bears are similarly more active at night and show lowerlevels of activity during the day. Where cover is much sparser, Sloth Bears often remain in shelter dens, usually crevices among boulders in rocky hillocks, the whole day, becoming active only near sunset. In central India , average daytime temperatures immediately outside shelter dens under a patchy (less than 25%) tree canopy, average 39°C (up to 44°C) compared to 28°C inside the dens. In winter, pregnant females den to give birth, whereas males and non-pregnant females remain active. It is unclear whether denning females actually undergo physiological hibernation in terms of reduced metabolism, recycling of body wastes, and preservation of muscle mass; they do not have large fat supplies to sustain them,like hibernating bears of other species, but they manage to survive without eating or drinking for 2 months. About 2 weeks before emerging from birthing dens with their cubs, they make nightly excursions from the den to feed. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Home ranges vary from very small (by ursid standards), averaging only 2 km ? for females and under 4 km ” for males in Sri Lanka , to moderately small ( 9 km ? for females, 14 km ® for males) in Nepal , to over 100 km ? for some individuals in India . In an alluvial floodplain in Nepal , adult male bears shift to higher elevation, forested habitat during the monsoon and use areas nearly twice as large as during the dry season. Females and younger males also expand their ranges, but seem to avoid the upland areas dominated by adult males. Significant seasonal range shifts have not been observed in areas that do not seasonally flood. Bears living in protected areas with intact habitat rarely use adjacent degraded forests and agricultural areas. Movement paths are often highly circuitous, and rates oftravel for active bears are rather slow (maximum about 1 km /h) compared to other ursids, probably reflective of abundant foods. Home ranges extensively overlap, and bears may occasionally feed very close to other individuals without apparent social interaction; however, even in dense populations,it appears that adult females maintain areas of exclusive use within their range. Unrelated subadults have been observed to join together for several weeks, and sibling subadults to stay together for up to 19 months after leaving their mother, possibly as coalitions against attacks by older bears or other predators. Females ultimately settle near their mothers. Subadult males are presumed to disperse, but empirical data are lacking.",,"These bears are more nocturnal than other bears, likely a response to the heat and sparse cover of their environment. Overall amount of activity varies widely, from 40-70% of the 24hour day, depending on conditions. In a national park in Nepal , with dense cover and moderate temperatures, most Sloth Bears are active both day and night, but are more active at night; conversely, subadults and females with cubs are diurnal, possibly to avoid being killed by nocturnal predators (Tigers) and other bears. In a park in Sri Lanka , with higher temperatures but dense cover, the bears are similarly more active at night and show lowerlevels of activity during the day. Where cover is much sparser, Sloth Bears often remain in shelter dens, usually crevices among boulders in rocky hillocks, the whole day, becoming active only near sunset. In central India , average daytime temperatures immediately outside shelter dens under a patchy (less than 25%) tree canopy, average 39°C (up to 44°C) compared to 28°C inside the dens. In winter, pregnant females den to give birth, whereas males and non-pregnant females remain active. It is unclear whether denning females actually undergo physiological hibernation in terms of reduced metabolism, recycling of body wastes, and preservation of muscle mass; they do not have large fat supplies to sustain them,like hibernating bears of other species, but they manage to survive without eating or drinking for 2 months. About 2 weeks before emerging from birthing dens with their cubs, they make nightly excursions from the den to feed.","Home ranges vary from very small (by ursid standards), averaging only 2 km ? for females and under 4 km ” for males in Sri Lanka , to moderately small ( 9 km ? for females, 14 km ® for males) in Nepal , to over 100 km ? for some individuals in India .

Females ultimately settle near their mothers. Subadult males are presumed to disperse, but empirical data are lacking. Breeding. Mating generally occurs from May to July. Males congregate near estrous females and fight for mating access. Females mate with multiple (often 3) males in the order of their established dominance, related largely to weight, and males mate with multiple females. Male-female pairs mate multiple times over a period of one hour to 1-2 days; copulations last 2-15 minutes. Females generally remain in estrus for only two days, rarely up to one week. Cubs are born from November through January. The 4-7 month gestation includes a period of delayed implantation. The birthing season may be somewhat lengthened in Sri Lanka , although previous reports of cubs being born throughout the year have not been corroborated by recent studies. Cubs are born in dens, either natural caves or holes excavated by the mother, and emerge with their mother at 2-2-5 months of age. The most common littersize is two cubs, although in some populations litters of one are also common; it is not known whether the latter represents cub mortality shortly after birth or small litters at birth. Litters of three are rare. Females have trouble raising litters of three because they carry their cubs on their back, and the third cub, carried over the hips, may bounce off. The long hair near the mother’s shoulders is a preferred riding place because it provides a better grip for the cub. Cubs remain on the back even when the mother vigorously digs for termites in deep holes (more than 1 m ). Mothers with cubs on their back travel more slowly than bears without cubs. Cubs ride either head first or crosswise for 6-9 months (by which time they are each about one-third the mass of the mother), increasing their time on the ground as they age. When threatened, they scamper to their mother’s back for refuge rather than climbing a tree, probably an adaptation to living in an environment with few trees and formidable predators (Tigers), some predators that can climb trees (Leopards), and large animals that can knock over trees (elephants, rhinoceroses). Cubs nurse for 12-14 months, and remain with their mother for either 1-5 or 2-5 years, so litter intervals are either two or three years.","CITES Appendix I. Listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Sloth Bears are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in all five range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property; this is not uncommon, given their aggressive nature and increasing numbers of encounters between bears and people, often resulting in human casualties. Although no reliable large-scale population estimates exist for this species, best guesstimates indicate about 20,000 or fewer animals rangewide. Substantial fragmentation and loss of habitat suggests that their population has declined by more than 30% over the past 30 years. The recent possible extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations throughout their range. Populations appear to be reasonably secure inside protected areas, but are faced with deteriorating habitat and direct killing outside. About half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside protected areas, and half the occupied range in Sri Lanka is not protected. Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (teak, eucalyptus), settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads. Commercial trade in bear parts has been reported, but its current extent and impact on Sloth Bears is uncertain. Poaching also occurs for local use (e.g. male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration). Capture of live cubs to raise as “dancing bears” remains a significant threat in some parts of India because laws against this are not adequately enforced. Some non-governmental organizations have been rescuing these bears (although they cannot be released to the wild) and training the people who hunted them in alternate types of work, in exchange for a commitment that they will not resume the practice.","Akhtar et al.

Sloth Bear Melursus ursinus French: Ours paresseux / German: Lippenbar / Spanish: Oso bezudo Other common names: Honey Bear , Lip Bear Taxonomy. Bradypus ursinus Shaw, 1791 , Bihar (earlier Bengal), India . Previously included in genus Bradypus = sloth. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. M. u. wrsinus Shaw, 1791 — India , Nepal , Bhutan , and Bangladesh . M. u. inornatus Pucheran, 1855 — Sri Lanka . Descriptive notes. Head-body 140-190 cm, tail 8-17 cm; weight of males 70-145 kg (rarely to 190 kg ), females 50-95 kg (rarely to 120 kg ). The Sri Lankan subspecies is smaller, and with a less-shaggy (shorter, sparser) coat than the nominate subspecies. Coat color is black, with rare brown or reddish-brown individuals. Hair length tends to be longer than in other bears, especially around the neck, shoulders, and back (up to 15-20 cm). The ears are also covered with long hair. Underfur is lacking, and ventral body hair is sparse. The muzzle has very short hair, and is distinctly light-colored up to the eyes. The lips are highly protrusible (hence this bear is sometimes called the Lip Bear), adapted for sucking termites, and the nose can be closed during such sucking, by pushing it against the side of the feeding excavation. The chest is normally marked by a prominent white V or U-shaped band. Sloth Bears have long (6-8 cm) slightly curved, ivory-colored front claws (for digging), and shorter rear claws. The long front claws (along with their coarse, shaggy coat and missing two upper incisors) are what seem to have caused an early taxonomist to call it a sloth. Soles of the feet are naked; unlike other bears, there is no hair between the digital pads and plantar pad on front and hindfeet, and also no hair separating the carpal and plantar (palmar) pad on the front. Unique among the bears, the digital pads are partially fused and are in a nearly straight line. Habitat. Occupies a wide range of habitats on the Indian subcontinent, including wet and dry tropical forests, savannas, scrublands, and grasslands. Densities are highest in alluvial grasslands, and second-highest in moist or dry deciduous forests. Characteristically a lowland species, mainly limited to habitats below 1500 m , but ranges up to 2000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats, India . In Sri Lanka ,it inhabits dry monsoon forests below 300 m . The climate throughout the range is monsoonal, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. This causes some variation in food habits and habitat use: very dry or very wet conditions can hamper feeding on termite colonies. Food and Feeding. Sloth Bears are both myrmecophagous and frugivorous. Ants, termites, and fruit dominate their diet, with proportions varying seasonally and regionally. Fruits (from at least ten families of trees and shrubs) constitute up to 90% of the diet during the fruiting season in southern India and 70% in Sri Lanka , but less than 40% in Nepal , where fewerfruits are available. Sloth Bears more often eat fallen fruits off the ground than climb to eatfruits in trees. However, they will readily climb to consume honey. During the non-fruiting season, insects make up 95% of the diet in Nepal and 75-80% in S India and Sri Lanka . The relative proportion of termites to ants in the diet also varies considerably by region; in Nepal and Sri Lanka this ratio 1s more than 2:1, whereas in central India the ratio varies from about 1:1 to 1:5, favoring ants. Sloth Bears feed on termites by digging into their mounds or underground colonies, then alternately sucking up the termites and blowing away debris. These distinctive “vacuuming” sounds can be heard from 200 m away. Although most of their diggings are less than 60 cm deep, they occasionally dig down 1-2 m. Sloth Bears typically eat little vegetative matter other than fruits and some flowers, and they rarely prey on mammals or eat carrion. However, where their habitat is severely degraded by intensive human use and most of their normal foods are not available, they feed heavily on cultivated fruits and agricultural crops such as peanuts, corn, potatoes, and yams. Activity patterns. These bears are more nocturnal than other bears, likely a response to the heat and sparse cover of their environment. Overall amount of activity varies widely, from 40-70% of the 24hour day, depending on conditions.

Invertebrates are the major food, beetles, grasshoppers, ants, and termites being eaten most often. They eat the fruits of two caperbush species, Capparis cartilaginea and C. spinosa, fruits and plant material of Phoenix dactylifera, Ochradenus baccatus, Fagonia mollis, and various species of Gramineae. Remains of vertebrates were present in about 10% of fecal samples analysed in one study. Blanford’s Foxes in Pakistan are largely frugivorous, feeding on Russian olives (Eleagnus bortensis), melons, and grapes. They are almost always solitary foragers, only occasionally foraging in pairs. Foraging behavior includes unhurried movements back and forth between rocky patches in a small area, sniffing and looking under large stones and occasionally digging, standing near a bush prior to circling the bush or pouncing upon prey within, and short, fast sprints after small terrestrial or low-flying prey. Food caching is rare or absent, unlike other fox species. Activity patterns. Strictly nocturnal, likely an anti-predator response to diurnal raptors.

Females are monoestrous and come into estrus during January and February. Gestation period is about 50-60 days, and litter size is 1-3 pups. Females have 2-6 active teats, and the lactation period is 30- 45 days. Neonates are born with soft, black fur. The body mass of a sub-adult is reached in about 3—4 months ( 700-900 g ). Young are entirely dependent upon their mother’s milk until they begin to forage for themselves. At two months of age the young start to forage, accompanied by one of the parents, and at three months of age they start to forage alone. Adult foxes have never been observed to carry food to the young. As in other small canids, food appears not to be regurgitated to the young. Males have been observed grooming and accompanying two- to four-month-old juveniles, but have not been seen feeding them or the female. Sexual maturity is reached at 10-12 months of age. Offspring often remain within their natal home range until autumn (October— November). Blanford’s Fox dens in Israel were usually on a mountain slope and consisted of large rock and boulder piles or scree. The foxes appeared to use only available natural cavities and never dug burrows. Dens were used for rearing young during spring and for daytime resting throughout the year. During winter and spring, both members of a pair frequently occupied the same den, or adjacent dens at the same site, while during summer and autumn they often denned in separate locations.

In Botswana , they have been recorded in Acacia scrubland, short grassland, and especially on the edges of shallow seasonal pans, as well as cleared and overgrazed areas. In the central Karoo of South Africa they occupy the plains as well as low, rocky ridges and isolated rock outcroppings. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , they have been recorded at elevations of 1000-1500 m .","The Cape Fox consumes a wide range of food items, including small rodents (murids), hares, reptiles, birds, invertebrates, and some wild fruits. An analysis of the contents of 57 stomachs collected across western and central South Africa and Botswana showed that rodents were the most commonly eaten mammal prey; beetles (larvae and adults) and grasshoppers comprised the majority of invertebrate intake. Birds and reptiles are occasionally included in the diet, but are probably less important. The largest wild prey species recorded are hares and spring hares.

Breeding appears to be non-seasonal in some areas, and strongly seasonal in others. The majority of births take place in spring and summer (August to October). Juveniles and sub-adults have been recorded in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces during November and December. Gestation lasts about 52 days, and litter size 1s from one to six pups. Young are born in burrows dug by adults in sandy soil, or in enlarged spring hare or Aardvark burrows. Births have also been known to occur in crevices, cavities amongst boulders, and occasionally, dense vegetation. Although both parents feed the pups, the female is the main provider and no helpers are found at dens. Both parents will defend the pups against potential predators. Their habit of abandoning one den for another could serve to avoid the accumulation of parasites and to confuse potential predators. Pups first begin to hunt at about 16 weeks, and become independent and disperse at the age of about five months. Communal denning has been recorded in the southern Kalahari, and a litter of eight pups found in the Free State perhaps reflects a similar situation.","CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Although treated as a pest across most of its range, it is partially protected in several South African provinces and is not listed as a problem species; no permit, however, is required to kill this fox in pest control operations, resulting in population reductions in some areas. Generally common to fairly abundant across much of its range, the species is considered to be stable. Population estimates are only available for South Africa’s Free State province , where average density was 0-3 foxes per km? yielding a total population estimate of 31,000 individuals. Habitat loss/changes are not a major factor influencing the conservation status of the Cape Fox. In fact, in the Western Cape Province and elsewhere, changing agricultural practices have resulted in range extensions for the species. Expansion of semi-arid karroid vegetation during the process of desertification, especially eastwards, has also resulted in range extensions of this canid. The illegal but widespread and indiscriminate use of agricultural poisons on commercial farms poses the greatest threat.","Bester (1982) | Bothma (1966, 1971c) | Brand (1963) | Coetzee (1977, 1979) | Crawford-Cabral (1989) | Kok (1996) | Le Clus (1971) | Lynch (1975, 1994) | Meester et al.

Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Although treated as a pest across most of its range, it is partially protected in several South African provinces and is not listed as a problem species; no permit, however, is required to kill this fox in pest control operations, resulting in population reductions in some areas. Generally common to fairly abundant across much of its range, the species is considered to be stable. Population estimates are only available for South Africa’s Free State province , where average density was 0-3 foxes per km? yielding a total population estimate of 31,000 individuals. Habitat loss/changes are not a major factor influencing the conservation status of the Cape Fox. In fact, in the Western Cape Province and elsewhere, changing agricultural practices have resulted in range extensions for the species. Expansion of semi-arid karroid vegetation during the process of desertification, especially eastwards, has also resulted in range extensions of this canid. The illegal but widespread and indiscriminate use of agricultural poisons on commercial farms poses the greatest threat. Bibliography.

Avoids dense forests, steep terrain, tall grasslands, and true deserts. The species is relatively abundant in areas of India where rainfall is low and the typical vegetation is scrub, thorn, or dry deciduous forests, or short grasslands.","Indian Foxes are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders. Their diet consists mainly of insects (e.g. crickets, winged termites, grasshoppers, ants, beetle grubs) and spiders, small rodents, including Soft-furred Field Rats ( Millardia meltada ), field mice ( Mus booduga ), and Indian Gerbils, and birds and their eggs, including indian mynahs (Acridotheres tristis), ashy-crowned finch larks (Eremopterix grisea) and gray partridges (Francolinus pondicerianus). Other prey species include ground lizards, rat snakes (Ptyas mucuosus), hedgehogs (Paraechinus nudiventris), and Indian Hares (Lepus naigricollis). Indian Foxes feed on fruits of ber (Ziziphus spp.), neem (Azadirachta indica), mango (Mangifera indica), jambu (Syizigium cumini), banyan (Ficus bengalenss), melons,fruits, and the shoots and pods of Cicer arietum. They have also been reported eating the freshly voided pellets of sheep. They forage alone. Activity patterns. In most parts of their range Indian Foxes are crepuscular and nocturnal.

During the breeding season, the male vocalizes intensively, mostly in early evening and early morning. The gestation period is 50-53 days and parturition occurs between January and March. Littersize is usually 2-4. Both parents bring food to the pups and guard the den, and helpers have not been observed. The parents take turns foraging and rarely is the den left unguarded. Post-natal care lasts approximately 4-5 months, after which the young disperse, usually at the onset of the monsoon (June/July in north-west India ), when food is plentiful.

Indian Fox Vulpes bengalensis French: Renard du Bengale / German: Bengalfuchs / Spanish: Zorro bengali Other common names: Bengal Fox Taxonomy. Canis bengalensis Shaw, 1800 , Bengal, India . Monotypic. Distribution. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Ranges from the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal to the S tip of the Indian peninsula, also in Bangladesh and Pakistan . Descriptive notes. Head-body 39-57-5 cm for males and 46-48 cm for females, tail 24-7-32 cm for males and 24-5-31-2 cm for females; weight 2:7-3-2 kg for males and over 1-8 kg for females. Mediumsized, with typical vulpine appearance, though smaller than Red Foxes ( V. vulpes ). The pelage varies from yellowish gray to silver gray, but lacks the rusty red hair that is typical of the Red Fox. The dorsal region is darker than the underparts, which are a pale cream. The ears have darker brown hair on the back. The nose and lips are black, and the eyes have dark tear marks. The muzzle is pointed, with tan to black hair around the upper part. The winter coat can be quite luxuriant. The limbs are slender, with some rufous coloring, and the tail is more than half the body length and has a black tip. The tail is carried trailing during normal travel, kept horizontal when the fox is running, and raised to almost vertical when the fox makes sudden turns. Females have three pairs of mammae. The dental formulais13/3,C1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. Habitat. Prefers semi-arid plains, open scrub and grassland habitats where it can easily hunt and dig dens. Avoids dense forests, steep terrain, tall grasslands, and true deserts. The species is relatively abundant in areas of India where rainfall is low and the typical vegetation is scrub, thorn, or dry deciduous forests, or short grasslands. Food and Feeding. Indian Foxes are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders. Their diet consists mainly of insects (e.g. crickets, winged termites, grasshoppers, ants, beetle grubs) and spiders, small rodents, including Soft-furred Field Rats ( Millardia meltada ), field mice ( Mus booduga ), and Indian Gerbils, and birds and their eggs, including indian mynahs (Acridotheres tristis), ashy-crowned finch larks (Eremopterix grisea) and gray partridges (Francolinus pondicerianus). Other prey species include ground lizards, rat snakes (Ptyas mucuosus), hedgehogs (Paraechinus nudiventris), and Indian Hares (Lepus naigricollis). Indian Foxes feed on fruits of ber (Ziziphus spp.), neem (Azadirachta indica), mango (Mangifera indica), jambu (Syizigium cumini), banyan (Ficus bengalenss), melons,fruits, and the shoots and pods of Cicer arietum. They have also been reported eating the freshly voided pellets of sheep. They forage alone. Activity patterns. In most parts of their range Indian Foxes are crepuscular and nocturnal. However, they may also hunt at middayif the temperature is mild, as on rainy days. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit is the breeding pair, and pair bonds may last for several years. Larger aggregations may exist when grown pups remain in the natal group for longer than normal. Two lactating females have been observed suckling pups in a single den during one year. Four adult-sized foxes were also observed resting together on two occasions. The common vocalization of the Indian Fox is a chattering cry that seems to have a major role in maintaining territoriality and may also be used as an alarm call. Foxes also growl, whimper, whine, and growl-bark. Indian Foxes scent-mark with droppings and urine. Breeding. December to January. During the breeding season, the male vocalizes intensively, mostly in early evening and early morning. The gestation period is 50-53 days and parturition occurs between January and March. Littersize is usually 2-4. Both parents bring food to the pups and guard the den, and helpers have not been observed. The parents take turns foraging and rarely is the den left unguarded. Post-natal care lasts approximately 4-5 months, after which the young disperse, usually at the onset of the monsoon (June/July in north-west India ), when food is plentiful. Dens are used primarily during the pup-rearing period, and are excavated in open habitat, never in dense vegetation. Indian Foxes will usually excavate their own dens but occasionally they will appropriate and enlarge gerbil holes. Dens consist of a mosaic of tunnels in various stages of excavation, leading to a small chamber about 0-5- 1 m below the surface where the pups are born. A den complex will usually have from two to seven holes, though as many as 43 have been recorded. The holes and tunnels of a well-used den site in Gujarat covered an area 10 x 8 m .

The relative abundance of insects, mammals, and plant material in the diet has been found to differ by habitat type , and by island, depending upon availability of food items. For example, North American Deermouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) occur at high densities on San Miguel Island, where they constitute a large proportion of Fox diet.

Dung beetles are consumed in great quantities when seasonally abundant. Other prey includes small mammals, grasshoppers, birds, and reptiles. Hoary Foxes tend to hunt as individuals or in loosely-knit pairs, with or without their juvenile offspring. Foraging group sizes of 3-5 were most common during periods of insect swarming. Hoary Foxes consume termites directly from the ground surface, or from the underside of dried cattle dung, which they flip over by pushing the dung along the ground at speed. Fox pups start eating insects at the age of at least two months. During the early rainy season, adult and young foxes catch flying ant and termite elates, as well as dung beetles. Activity patterns.

In the wild, females produce litters of 4-5 offspring once a year during July and August. Pups are born in disused armadillo burrows, particularly dens of Euphractus sexcinctus . Offspring are cared for by the breeding male and female; there is no evidence that other foxes help. During late lactation, the female may visit the den a couple of times per night to nurse; in her absence, the male babysits, grooms, and guards the pups against potential predators. Post-weaning female contact declines substantially, whereas the male stays with the pups during hunting expeditions to insect patches close to the den. The estimated lactation period in the wild is three months. Juveniles of both sexes disperse when 9-10 months old and may establish home ranges adjacent to their natal territory.","CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Considered “vulnerable” in individual state faunal status accounts, but not listed in the Brazilian list of threatened mammals. No reliable data on population size, but considered locally abundant in the central highland cerrado biome, although populations appear smaller than those of the sympatric Crab-eating Fox, for which population estimates are similarly lacking. There is no specific hunting legislation for Hoary Foxes. The principal biome where Hoary Foxes occur is the cerrado, which is being destroyed at a rate of 3% each year, largely in the interests of agriculture (livestock and soybean). It appears that Hoary Foxes adapt to livestock pasture rich in termites and dung beetles. Breeding foxes are found in deforested wooded areas; thusit is possible that deforestation may not have a negative impact on the species. Areas of high human population density are unlikely to be suitable. Hoary Foxes are killed indiscriminately as predators of domestic fowl, although Crab-eating Foxes are probably more often the predators. Young foxes are often taken as pets.

Hoary Fox Pseudalopex vetulus French: Renard chenu / German: Brasilianischer Kampfuchs / Spanish: Zorro brasileno Other common names: Small-toothed Dog Taxonomy. Canis vetulus Lund, 1842 , Minas Gerais , Brazil . Monotypic. Distribution. Confined to Brazil , associated with the Cerrado habitats of the central Brazilian plateau. Descriptive notes. Head-body 49-71-5 cm for males and 51-66 cm for females, tail 27-38 cm for males and 25-31 cm for females; weight 2-5-4 kg for males and 3-3-6 kg for females. Slender with a relatively short, pointed muzzle and large ears. Pelage coloris variable: the upperparts are pale gray, whereas the underparts are generally buff yellow to chestnut, including the neck, chest and a patch behind the ears. The anterior part of the neck is buff white, but the underside of the lower jaw is dark, almost black, as are both the tail base and tail tip; a dark spot on the dorsal surface of the tail base is variably present. Near melanic forms have been described. Dental formulais13/3,C1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. Habitat. Occurs in open cerrado habitats, but readily adapts to insectrich livestock pastures and agricultural fields. Rarely observed in densely wooded cerrado, floodplains, or dry or gallery forests. Food and Feeding. Omnivorous, though the diet is mainly insects, particularly grounddwelling harvester termites (Synthermes spp. and Cornitermes spp.), recorded in 87% of feces across its geographical range. Dung beetles are consumed in great quantities when seasonally abundant. Other prey includes small mammals, grasshoppers, birds, and reptiles. Hoary Foxes tend to hunt as individuals or in loosely-knit pairs, with or without their juvenile offspring. Foraging group sizes of 3-5 were most common during periods of insect swarming. Hoary Foxes consume termites directly from the ground surface, or from the underside of dried cattle dung, which they flip over by pushing the dung along the ground at speed. Fox pups start eating insects at the age of at least two months. During the early rainy season, adult and young foxes catch flying ant and termite elates, as well as dung beetles. Activity patterns. Predominantly nocturnal. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Monogamous. One study group living in pasture were an adult breeding pair and their five juvenile offspring. They shared largely overlapping home ranges of 4-6 km ® (range 4-5—4-6 km *). Contact rates of a single breeding pair estimated by radio-telemetry indicated that they spent up to 35% of their activity period in close proximity, though this varied substantially when they were rearing offspring (October to May). Spot sightings in different habitats and localities revealed that groups were composed of single animals on 75% of occasions, followed by pairs (30%), and groups larger than two (4%). Vocalizations are most common during the mating season and include a roar and threatening bark. Hoary Foxes urinate using a raised leg position; frequent urination in small quantities is typical of territory marking behavior. Breeding. In the wild, females produce litters of 4-5 offspring once a year during July and August. Pups are born in disused armadillo burrows, particularly dens of Euphractus sexcinctus . Offspring are cared for by the breeding male and female; there is no evidence that other foxes help. During late lactation, the female may visit the den a couple of times per night to nurse; in her absence, the male babysits, grooms, and guards the pups against potential predators. Post-weaning female contact declines substantially, whereas the male stays with the pups during hunting expeditions to insect patches close to the den. The estimated lactation period in the wild is three months. Juveniles of both sexes disperse when 9-10 months old and may establish home ranges adjacent to their natal territory. Status and Conservation. CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Considered “vulnerable” in individual state faunal status accounts, but not listed in the Brazilian list of threatened mammals. No reliable data on population size, but considered locally abundant in the central highland cerrado biome, although populations appear smaller than those of the sympatric Crab-eating Fox, for which population estimates are similarly lacking. There is no specific hunting legislation for Hoary Foxes. The principal biome where Hoary Foxes occur is the cerrado, which is being destroyed at a rate of 3% each year, largely in the interests of agriculture (livestock and soybean). It appears that Hoary Foxes adapt to livestock pasture rich in termites and dung beetles. Breeding foxes are found in deforested wooded areas; thusit is possible that deforestation may not have a negative impact on the species. Areas of high human population density are unlikely to be suitable. Hoary Foxes are killed indiscriminately as predators of domestic fowl, although Crab-eating Foxes are probably more often the predators. Young foxes are often taken as pets. Some are killed by domestic dogs when dens are located in peri-urban areas. Road kills have been recorded. Bibliography.

Its diet shows great geographic variation and may include both wild and domestic vertebrates (particularly rodents and birds), fruit, insects, carrion, and garbage. Based on stomach contents, wild mammals and sheep appeared to be the two most common food items in Uruguay , while in La Pampa Province , Argentina , European Hares and rodents were the most common food items, followed by birds and carrion. In Buenos Aires Province , Argentina , there was a high frequency of rodents and birds, but also of insects, fruits, and crabs. Seasonal and local variations in diet are likely connected to variations in food availability. The Pampas Fox is a solitary and opportunistic carnivore. Large, highly concentrated food resources (i.e. large mammal carcasses) may cause several individuals to gather, possibly beyond the borders of normal home ranges. Food caching behavior has been observed, apparently related to an increase in the availability of rodents. Activity patterns.

South American Gray Foxes generally inhabit plains and low mountains, but they have been reported to occur as high as 3500-4000 m . Although they occur in a variety of habitats, they prefer shrubby open areas. In Chile , they hunt more commonly in flat open patches of low scrub. In Chilean Patagonia, their typical habitat consists of shrubby steppe composed of coiron (Festuca spp., Stipa spp.) and nires (Nothofagus antarctica). Burning and destruction of forests for sheep farming seems to have been advantageous for these foxes. In Torres del Paine National Park, 58% of twelve individuals monitored showed preferential use of matorral shrubland or Nothofagus thicket habitat within their home ranges. In the Mendoza desert, Argentina , they prefer the lower levels of shrubby sand dunes rather than higher sections. They tolerate a variety of climates, including hot and dry areas such as the Atacama coastal desert in northern Chile (less than 2 mm average annual rainfall, 22°C mean annual temperature), the humid, temperate Valdivian forest ( 2000 mm average annual rainfall, 12°C mean annual temperature), and the cold environment of Tierra del Fuego (c. 400 mm average annual rainfall, 7°C mean annual temperature).","South American Gray Foxes are omnivorous generalists, feeding on a variety of foods, including mammals, arthropods, birds, reptiles, fruit, and carrion. Fruits ingested include berries of Cryptocarya alba and Lithraea caustica in Chile , pods of Prosopis spp., and the berry-like fruits of Prosopanche americana and of several Cactaceae in Argentina . A tendency to carnivory is apparent, however, since vertebrates, especially rodents, are reported to be the most important prey in most studies. Small mammals were the most frequently occurring vertebrate prey in most sites in the Chilean matorral and in the temperate rainforests of southern Chile . In Torres del Paine National Park, the European Hare was the most represented vertebrate prey, followed by carrion and akodontine rodents. In the Argentine Patagonian steppe, carrion was the most important food item in 42 stomachs collected in winter (representing 62% of biomass ingested), followed by hares and cricetine rodents. In Argentina’s southern Patagonia, diet also consisted primarily of carrion, followed by birds, rodents, and fruit. Diet included invertebrates, carrion, birds, and rodents in Tierra del Fuego . In the harshest habitats ofits range, the foxes’ diets include increasingly higher proportions of non-mammal food as small mammal availability decreases. Lizards were the most consumed vertebrate prey in winter, the season of lowest small mammal availability in coastal northern Chile . Small-mammal consumption decreased from autumn to summer, and fruit consumption increased. In central Chile , berries appeared in 52% of the droppings (n = 127) collected in autumn, while in spring, when small mammal availability is highest, berries were present in only 18% of the feces (n = 62). In Mendoza (Monte desert), fruit was represented in 35% of feces (n = 116), followed by small mammals (19% frequency of occurrence). Foraging occurs mostly in open areas. Although hunting groups of up to 4-5 individuals have been reported, South American Gray Foxes mostly hunt solitarily, except perhaps at the end of the breeding season, when juveniles may join the parents in search of food. In Torres del Paine National Park, the most common foraging behavior consisted of slow walking, with abrupt, irregular turns through low vegetation. The same report noted that prey appear to be located by sound, sight, and smell. Mice are captured with a sudden leap or by rapidly digging holes. Scavenging is common, as well as defecation on and around Guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and domestic goat carcasses. Caching behavior has also been reported. Activity patterns. Direct observations and prey activity patterns suggest that South American Gray Foxes are crepuscular, although they are commonly seen during the day. Radio-tracking showed that they were primarily nocturnal in Torres del Paine National Park, whereas they were active during both day and night in Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic component of social organization in Torres del Paine National Park is the breeding monogamous pair, accompanied by occasional female helpers. Male dispersal and occasional polygyny is also reported. Solitary individuals were seen from March to July, while pairs comprised 42% of sightings during August. The male and female of an observed pair maintained an exclusive home range year-round, which did not overlap with home ranges of neighboring pairs. Intraspecific interactions were few and usually aggressive. Individual home range sizes (n = 23) averaged 2-0 km”.",,"Direct observations and prey activity patterns suggest that South American Gray Foxes are crepuscular, although they are commonly seen during the day.

Mating occurs in August and September, the gestation period is 53-58 days and 4-6 pups are born in October. Dens are located in a variety of natural and manmade places such as a hole at the base of a shrub or in culverts under a dirt road The pups may be moved to a new location during the nursing period. During the first few days the mother rarely leaves the den and the male provisions her with food. Pups are cared for by both parents on an approximately equal time basis. Young foxes start to emerge from the den when they are about one month old, and start to disperse ( 8-65 km ) at 6-7 months of age. Two interesting phenomena concerning breeding behavior may occur: litters of two females combine (associated with polygyny) and the presence of female helpers. Both seem to be related to food availability and litter size. Female helpers contribute by bringing provisioning food to the den and increasing anti-predator vigilance.","CITES Appendix II.

Hunting them and fur trading are legal in Argentine Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego . All Chilean populations are currently protected by law, except for those from Tierra del Fuego . The main threat to South American Gray Fox populations in the past was commercial hunting for fur. Hunting intensity has apparently declined in recentyears. Illegal killing still occurs in some regions,as the foxes are perceived to be voracious predators of small livestock, poultry and game. The usual means of hunting are by shooting, dogs, poison, snares, and foothold traps. Around 45% of the mortality documented in Torres del Paine National Park resulted from either poaching or dog attacks.

Intraspecific interactions were few and usually aggressive. Individual home range sizes (n = 23) averaged 2-0 km”. Breeding. Mating occurs in August and September, the gestation period is 53-58 days and 4-6 pups are born in October. Dens are located in a variety of natural and manmade places such as a hole at the base of a shrub or in culverts under a dirt road The pups may be moved to a new location during the nursing period. During the first few days the mother rarely leaves the den and the male provisions her with food. Pups are cared for by both parents on an approximately equal time basis. Young foxes start to emerge from the den when they are about one month old, and start to disperse ( 8-65 km ) at 6-7 months of age. Two interesting phenomena concerning breeding behavior may occur: litters of two females combine (associated with polygyny) and the presence of female helpers. Both seem to be related to food availability and litter size. Female helpers contribute by bringing provisioning food to the den and increasing anti-predator vigilance. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Considered “locally common” in Argentina and stable in the southern half of the country where habitat is more favorable. Reported to have expanded their range in Tierra del Fuego since being introduced there: in 1996 their density was estimated at 1 per km®. Hunting them and fur trading are legal in Argentine Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego . All Chilean populations are currently protected by law, except for those from Tierra del Fuego . The main threat to South American Gray Fox populations in the past was commercial hunting for fur. Hunting intensity has apparently declined in recentyears. Illegal killing still occurs in some regions,as the foxes are perceived to be voracious predators of small livestock, poultry and game. The usual means of hunting are by shooting, dogs, poison, snares, and foothold traps. Around 45% of the mortality documented in Torres del Paine National Park resulted from either poaching or dog attacks. Road kills are frequently observed in Argentina , especially in summer.

They inhabit dense Valdivian forest, which is very moist all year round. The forest is dominated by fruit-bearing trees in the family Mirtaceae ; there are a few native conifers and several species of broad-leaved evergreens. Radio-tracking along a gradient of disturbance on Chiloé indicated that, in decreasing order, foxes use old-growth Valdivian forest followed by secondary forest followed by pastures and openings; about 70% of home ranges comprised old-growth forest. However, when compared to the availability of each forest gradient, foxes showed preference for secondary forest and avoided old growth. On the Pacific coast of Chiloé, Darwin’s Foxes live in a fragmented environment of coastal sand dunes and dense evergreen forest. On the northern part of the island, they use a relatively flat, fragmented landscape of broadleaf forest and cow pasture. The mainland population uses dense forest; animals are found with decreasing frequency in dense monkey-puzzle tree-southern beech (Araucaria-Nothofagus spp.) forest, open Nothofagus forest and open pasture, respectively.","Omnivorous, with a broad diet, and highly opportunistic. These traits facilitate its survival in a highly fluctuating environment with low prey availability. Fecal analysis showed that the mainland population ate primarily small mammals, followed, in decreasing levels of importance, by reptiles, insects, birds, and arachnids. The proportions of these prey classes fluctuated strongly according to season. Berries were also included in the diet, occurring in about. 20% of the feces. On the mainland Darwin’s Foxes rely heavily on the seeds of monkey-puzzle trees from March to May. On Chiloé,fecal analysis revealed that insects were the most abundant food item in the diet during the warm season, followed by amphibians, mammals, birds, and reptiles; 49% offeces contained seeds. During late summer and fall, the diet was almost entirely fruits of Mirtaceae trees. Foxes may be considered a key species because of their role in dispersing the seeds of forest plants. An experiment indicated that a high percent age of the seeds of one tree species ( Amomyrtus luma ) collected from feces germinated underfield conditions. Darwin’s Foxes also eat carrion in small amounts, as evidenced by the remains (e.g. hair) of sheep, pigs, cattle, and horses in feces. Local settlers reported that lone foxes also kill Southern Pudu deer (Pudu puda; about 10 kg in weight) by biting their ankles and then the throat. In addition, coastal foxes feed on shellfish and shorebirds, and have been observed feeding on large brown algae on the beach. On following pages: 16.

Given the very large range overlaps among neighboring foxes, and that individuals share their home range with an average of 4- 7 males and 3- 3 females , Darwin’s Fox appears to be non-territorial. On the mainland, pairs persist throughout the year, and are often found in close proximity. In contrast with the Chiloé population, mainland pairs have been known to share their home ranges with offspring from previous years. All family members associate closely with each other, showing very little aggressive behavior towards one another.

Compared to the South American Gray Fox, Culpeos have longer canines and shorter second molars. The dental formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42.","The Culpeo ranges from rugged and mountain terrain up to the tree line, to deep valleys and open deserts, scrubby pampas, sclerophyllous matorral, and broadleaved temperate southern beech forest in the south. The Culpeo uses the entire range of habitat moisture gradients from the dry desert to broad-leaved rainforest. In the Andes of Peru , Chile , Bolivia , and Argentina it reaches elevations of up to 4800 m , where it occupies colder and dryer environments than any other South American canid.","Diet includes wild ungulates, domestic sheep (northern Patagonia), European Hares (Lepus europeus), European Rabbits, small mammals, lizards, birds, and insects. Although it is an opportunistic predator, the Culpeo is considered more carnivorous and a consumer of larger mammalian prey than the other South American foxes. Most trophic studies found seasonal differences in diet composition, probably in response to prey availability. In Argentine Patagonia, Culpeos showed a preference for hares and selected among rodent species for those that may be more vulnerable. Culpeos in central Chile selected the largest small mammals available. Although the bulk of the diet consists of animal prey, Culpeos are often described as consumers offruits and berries and are therefore thought to disperse seeds of a variety of plant species. Highest fruit consumption occurs when small mammals are the least abundant. Culpeos tend to forage solitarily. Their foraging activity may be influenced by the nocturnal habits of their main prey, but also by persecution. Activity patterns. In Argentina , Magallanes, and the Chilean desert, and highland Peru (where it is intensively persecuted) the Culpeo is almost completely nocturnal. This contrasts with the diurnal activity shown in north-central Chile , where it is protected. Culpeos have been recorded moving linear distances of about 7 km in north-western Patagonia, but desert-dwelling foxes in northern Chile have been recorded moving three times as far. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Culpeos seem to be solitary foxes. Spatial studies throughout their range indicate that they have inter- and intra-sexual non-overlapping home ranges. Small areas of spatial overlap occur at sites of human refuse, but the foxes still segregate temporally. Females are apparently more spatially intolerant than males. In north-central Chile , home ranges of females averaged 8-9 km * and were 2-5 times larger than those of males. In contrast, Culpeo home ranges in Torres del Paine National Park (south Chile ) were only 4-5 km ? in size and similar for males and females. Desert-dwelling Culpeos show high variability in home range size, ranging from 10 km ” for Culpeosliving in ravines to 800 km ? for foxes associated with highland salt flats and lakes.",,"In Argentina , Magallanes, and the Chilean desert, and highland Peru (where it is intensively persecuted) the Culpeo is almost completely nocturnal.

In the Patagonian steppe of Argentina , male Culpeos produce sperm between June and mid-October (early winter to early spring). Females are monoestrous and mating occurs from the beginning of August through October. Gestation is 58 days. Based on embryo counts, estimated mean litter size is 5-2 (range 3-8). Neonates weigh about 170 g . Juveniles reach adult size within seven months and can reproduce during the first year. Although the sex ratio of 253 individuals was skewed in favor of males in the Neuquén population, some 30 years later the sex ratio approached parity, as expected for intensively hunted populations.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red Last. In Chile the species is considered Insufficiently Known and the subspecies P. ¢. lycoides is considered Endangered. Despite being similarly decreed as “endangered” in Argentina , due to the number of Culpeo pelts traded during the 1970s and early 1980s, national trade and export of this product has remained legal. Culpeos appear to withstand intense hunting levels and still maintain viable regional populations. Recent estimates reported densities of 0-2-1-3 individuals/km? in north-western Patagonia, Argentina , and 0-3-1-3 individuals/km? in Chile . Hunting has been banned since 1980), although law enforcement is not strict. Although Culpeo fur exports were banned in Bolivia in 1986, the species is not protected in that country. Culpeos are persecuted to reduce predation on livestock and poultry. They prey on newborn lambs and account for an estimated 60% of the attacks by predators in Patagonia. Predation by feral and domestic dogs may threaten Culpeos in some areas, and road kills occur frequently in Argentina .","Bustamante et al. (1992) | Cofré & Marquet (1999) | Corley et al.

Culpeo Pseudalopex culpaeus French: Renard des Andes / German: Andenfuchs / Spanish: Zorro andino Other common names: Andean Fox Taxonomy. Canis culpaeus Molina, 1782. Santiago Province , Chile . The taxonomic status of the Culpeo is still unresolved, despite a range of propositions for including it under Dusicyon , Canis , and Lycalopex . Six subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. P. c. culpaeus Molina, 1782 — W & C Argentina and C Chile . P. c. andinus Thomas, 1914 — altiplano of Bolivia , N Chile , and Peru . P.c. lycoides Philippi, 1895 — Tierra del Fuego . P.c. magellanicus Gray, 1837 — Argentina and S Chile . P. c. reissu Hilzheimer, 1906 — Ecuadorian Andes and extreme S Colombia ( Narino ). P. c. smithersi Thomas, 1914 — Argentina (Cordoba Mts). Descriptive notes. Head-body 44-5-92- 5 cm for males and 49-89 cm for females, tail 30-5-49- 3 cm for males and 31-45 cm for females; weight 3-4-13- 8 kg for males and 3: 9-10 kg for females. The largest fox in the genus Pseudalopex . The broad head and wide muzzle impart a powerful appearance. Males larger and on average 1-5 times heavier than females. White to light tawny chin and body underparts. Dorsal parts of the head, including the ears and neck, as well as legs and flanks are tawny or rufous. The rump is darker, ranging in color from tawny to dark gray, according to the subspecies. The tail is long, bushy, and gray, with a black tip and a dark dorsal patch near its base. Feet and legs are bright tawny with no black. Specimens from northern ranges (1.e. andinus) are lighter in color. Compared to the South American Gray Fox, Culpeos have longer canines and shorter second molars. The dental formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. Habitat. The Culpeo ranges from rugged and mountain terrain up to the tree line, to deep valleys and open deserts, scrubby pampas, sclerophyllous matorral, and broadleaved temperate southern beech forest in the south. The Culpeo uses the entire range of habitat moisture gradients from the dry desert to broad-leaved rainforest. In the Andes of Peru , Chile , Bolivia , and Argentina it reaches elevations of up to 4800 m , where it occupies colder and dryer environments than any other South American canid. Food and Feeding. Diet includes wild ungulates, domestic sheep (northern Patagonia), European Hares (Lepus europeus), European Rabbits, small mammals, lizards, birds, and insects. Although it is an opportunistic predator, the Culpeo is considered more carnivorous and a consumer of larger mammalian prey than the other South American foxes. Most trophic studies found seasonal differences in diet composition, probably in response to prey availability. In Argentine Patagonia, Culpeos showed a preference for hares and selected among rodent species for those that may be more vulnerable. Culpeos in central Chile selected the largest small mammals available. Although the bulk of the diet consists of animal prey, Culpeos are often described as consumers offruits and berries and are therefore thought to disperse seeds of a variety of plant species. Highest fruit consumption occurs when small mammals are the least abundant. Culpeos tend to forage solitarily. Their foraging activity may be influenced by the nocturnal habits of their main prey, but also by persecution. Activity patterns. In Argentina , Magallanes, and the Chilean desert, and highland Peru (where it is intensively persecuted) the Culpeo is almost completely nocturnal. This contrasts with the diurnal activity shown in north-central Chile , where it is protected. Culpeos have been recorded moving linear distances of about 7 km in north-western Patagonia, but desert-dwelling foxes in northern Chile have been recorded moving three times as far. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Culpeos seem to be solitary foxes. Spatial studies throughout their range indicate that they have inter- and intra-sexual non-overlapping home ranges. Small areas of spatial overlap occur at sites of human refuse, but the foxes still segregate temporally. Females are apparently more spatially intolerant than males. In north-central Chile , home ranges of females averaged 8-9 km * and were 2-5 times larger than those of males. In contrast, Culpeo home ranges in Torres del Paine National Park (south Chile ) were only 4-5 km ? in size and similar for males and females. Desert-dwelling Culpeos show high variability in home range size, ranging from 10 km ” for Culpeosliving in ravines to 800 km ? for foxes associated with highland salt flats and lakes. Breeding. In the Patagonian steppe of Argentina , male Culpeos produce sperm between June and mid-October (early winter to early spring). Females are monoestrous and mating occurs from the beginning of August through October. Gestation is 58 days. Based on embryo counts, estimated mean litter size is 5-2 (range 3-8). Neonates weigh about 170 g . Juveniles reach adult size within seven months and can reproduce during the first year. Although the sex ratio of 253 individuals was skewed in favor of males in the Neuquén population, some 30 years later the sex ratio approached parity, as expected for intensively hunted populations. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red Last. In Chile the species is considered Insufficiently Known and the subspecies P. ¢. lycoides is considered Endangered. Despite being similarly decreed as “endangered” in Argentina , due to the number of Culpeo pelts traded during the 1970s and early 1980s, national trade and export of this product has remained legal. Culpeos appear to withstand intense hunting levels and still maintain viable regional populations. Recent estimates reported densities of 0-2-1-3 individuals/km? in north-western Patagonia, Argentina , and 0-3-1-3 individuals/km? in Chile . Hunting has been banned since 1980), although law enforcement is not strict. Although Culpeo fur exports were banned in Bolivia in 1986, the species is not protected in that country. Culpeos are persecuted to reduce predation on livestock and poultry. They prey on newborn lambs and account for an estimated 60% of the attacks by predators in Patagonia. Predation by feral and domestic dogs may threaten Culpeos in some areas, and road kills occur frequently in Argentina . Bibliography. Bustamante et al. (1992), Cofré & Marquet (1999), Corley et al.

Typically vulpine in appearance. Males slightly bigger than females, but sexual dimorphism not pronounced. Head grayish-ocher or brown, ears banded brown on frontside, back of ears ocher-gray or reddish-brown. Breast, belly, and groin white or yellowish. Front of forelegs light yellow,sides rusty-yellow, hindlegs paler. Summer fur short and sparse, winter fur dense, soft and silky, straw-grayish with ocher. Awn hairs tipped silver-white. Tail about half body length or slightly more, grayish-brown, covered with dense bushy hair, tip dark, often black. Skull similar to that of V. vulpes , but smaller, shorter and wider, and with canine teeth more robust. The dental formula 813/38, C1/1,PM4/4.M2/3=42.","Typically inhabits steppes, semi-deserts, and deserts, avoiding mountains, forested areas, and dense bush. In the western part of the range, Corsac Foxes occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall-grass steppes. They also occur in sandy habitats and shrubland semi-deserts, and in favorable years, in forested steppes. They avoid areas where depth of snow exceeds c. 15 cm , preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed. Corsac Foxes appear to depend on ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) and marmots (Marmota spp.) for food and shelter (the burrows being enlarged and used for daytime refuge).","Generally opportunistic, with a highly variable diet throughout its range that probably changes in accordance with availability. The bulk of the diet often includes the most common rodents of an area. Birds, reptiles (lizards, snakes and young tortoises), and insects are also frequently consumed, especially in summer, as well as small amounts of vegetation (including fruit and seeds). During winter and periods of low prey abundance, scavenged Gray Wolf kills and carcasses of wild and domestic ungulates are a major source of food in some areas. Typical prey in western Siberia includes voles (Microtus gregalis, Arvicola terrestris), lemmings (Lagurus spp.), ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.), and jerboas (Allactaga spp.) Common winter prey also often includes Arctic Hares (Lepus timidus) and birds such as gray partridges (Perdix perdix) and snow buntings (Pleptrophenax nivalis). In the forest-steppe of Kazakhstan , the diet consists primarily of lemmings and sousliks. On the Ustyurt Plateau and in Turkmenistan the main prey are gerbils ( Meriones spp. , Rhombomys opimus); in Transbaikalia and Mongolia , the main prey species are gerbils ( Meriones spp. ), jerboas (Allactaga spp. and Dipus spp.), hamsters (Cricetulus spp. and Phodopus spp.), Brandt's Voles (Lasiopodomys brandltii), Siberian Marmots (Marmota sibirica), and pikas (Ochotona spp.). The foxes are solitary foragers, although near carrion or the remains of wolf kills several Corsacs may gather together. The foxes hunt by stalking prey and making sudden short-distance attacks. They locate ground-nesting birds and other small prey by sound and smell. Despite their small size they can kill prey up to the size of young marmots, hares, ducks, pheasants, and geese. Activity patterns. Corsac Foxes are active mainly at night. Hunting starts in the evening and continues through the first part of the night, with a second peak of activity before dawn. Sometimes they are also active in daytime, especially during the summer months. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit is the breeding pair, and monogamous pairs may persist for life. During winter, several Corsacs may gather in a single den, indicating a relatively high degree of sociality. Polygamous families may occur under favorable feeding conditions. In optimal habitats during years of high prey abundance, the home range of a family pair may be as small as 1 km ?. In contrast, home ranges are significantly larger in habitats with low food abundance, and may reach 35-40 km ?. Corsacs occupy dens, often the burrows of marmots, during the day. Dens provide shelter from weather, but may also serve as important refuges from predation by larger canids such as Wolves and Red Foxes. Scent marking is important for maintaining territories, and marking with urine and feces is most frequent near dens. Barking is the most common vocalization. Barks have many different tonal variations, and are used during courtship, territorial demonstrations, and alarm. They are higher in pitch than the barks of Red Foxes and sound similar to a cat’s mew. Close distance vocalizations include high-tone rhythmic sounds, peeping, chirping, and yelping.",,"Corsac Foxes are active mainly at night.

Across the range of the species, mating takes place from January to early March. There is only one litter per year and gestation varies from 52 to 60 days. The earliest birth time is mid-March, most births occurring in April. Average litter size in Kazakhstan was 5-5 (range = 2-10). Pups usually emerge from dens in mid-May. At 28 days they start eating meat. The male takes an active part in parental care by feeding the young, and in favorable years helpers may assist with feeding and guarding the young. Pups reach adult size at four to five months, and in captivity sexual maturity is reached by nine months. They disperse by the end of summer, but do not venture far from their natal range, and some are likely to return to stay over the autumn-winter season.","CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Current population status and the nature of major threats is unknown in most regions. Corsac Foxes were once considered ubiquitous across Central Asia, but notable declines have occurred in recent years following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. In Russia the Corsac Fox is rare in most regions, but relatively common in western Siberia and Transbaikalia. The species is common between the Volga and Ural rivers, but probably declining in Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Mongolia , and northern China . Corsac Foxes are rare in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and the south-western portion of their range. In many countries, hunting them is legal during certain seasons, but enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations rarely occurs. Over-hunting and illegal poaching (even in protected areas) remains the most significant threat to the species.

Corsac Fox Vulpes corsac French: Renard corsac / German: Steppenfuchs / Spanish: Zorro estepario Other common names: Corsac Taxonomy. Canis corsac Linnaeus, 1768 , northern Kazakhstan . It has been suggested that Canis ekloni from northern Tibet is a subspecies of the Corsac Fox. However, C. ekloni is a junior synonym of V. ferrilata . Four subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. V. c. corsac Linnaeus, 1768 — N part of range to pre-Altai steppe. Vc. kalmykorum Ognev, 1935 — Volgo-Ural steppes and Volga Basin. V. c. scorodumovi Dorogostaiski, 1935 — N China , Mongolia , and Russia (Transbaikalia). V. c. turemenicus Ognev, 1935 — plains of C Asia and N Afghanistan , NE Iran , and Kazakhstan . Descriptive notes. Head-body 45-59-5 cm for males and 45-50 cm for females, tail 19-30 cm for males and 25-30 cm for females; weight 1-6-3-2 kg for males and 1-9-2-4 kg for females. Typically vulpine in appearance. Males slightly bigger than females, but sexual dimorphism not pronounced. Head grayish-ocher or brown, ears banded brown on frontside, back of ears ocher-gray or reddish-brown. Breast, belly, and groin white or yellowish. Front of forelegs light yellow,sides rusty-yellow, hindlegs paler. Summer fur short and sparse, winter fur dense, soft and silky, straw-grayish with ocher. Awn hairs tipped silver-white. Tail about half body length or slightly more, grayish-brown, covered with dense bushy hair, tip dark, often black. Skull similar to that of V. vulpes , but smaller, shorter and wider, and with canine teeth more robust. The dental formula 813/38, C1/1,PM4/4.M2/3=42. Habitat. Typically inhabits steppes, semi-deserts, and deserts, avoiding mountains, forested areas, and dense bush. In the western part of the range, Corsac Foxes occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall-grass steppes. They also occur in sandy habitats and shrubland semi-deserts, and in favorable years, in forested steppes. They avoid areas where depth of snow exceeds c. 15 cm , preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed. Corsac Foxes appear to depend on ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) and marmots (Marmota spp.) for food and shelter (the burrows being enlarged and used for daytime refuge). Food and Feeding. Generally opportunistic, with a highly variable diet throughout its range that probably changes in accordance with availability. The bulk of the diet often includes the most common rodents of an area. Birds, reptiles (lizards, snakes and young tortoises), and insects are also frequently consumed, especially in summer, as well as small amounts of vegetation (including fruit and seeds). During winter and periods of low prey abundance, scavenged Gray Wolf kills and carcasses of wild and domestic ungulates are a major source of food in some areas. Typical prey in western Siberia includes voles (Microtus gregalis, Arvicola terrestris), lemmings (Lagurus spp.), ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.), and jerboas (Allactaga spp.) Common winter prey also often includes Arctic Hares (Lepus timidus) and birds such as gray partridges (Perdix perdix) and snow buntings (Pleptrophenax nivalis). In the forest-steppe of Kazakhstan , the diet consists primarily of lemmings and sousliks. On the Ustyurt Plateau and in Turkmenistan the main prey are gerbils ( Meriones spp. , Rhombomys opimus); in Transbaikalia and Mongolia , the main prey species are gerbils ( Meriones spp. ), jerboas (Allactaga spp. and Dipus spp.), hamsters (Cricetulus spp. and Phodopus spp.), Brandt's Voles (Lasiopodomys brandltii), Siberian Marmots (Marmota sibirica), and pikas (Ochotona spp.). The foxes are solitary foragers, although near carrion or the remains of wolf kills several Corsacs may gather together. The foxes hunt by stalking prey and making sudden short-distance attacks. They locate ground-nesting birds and other small prey by sound and smell. Despite their small size they can kill prey up to the size of young marmots, hares, ducks, pheasants, and geese. Activity patterns. Corsac Foxes are active mainly at night. Hunting starts in the evening and continues through the first part of the night, with a second peak of activity before dawn. Sometimes they are also active in daytime, especially during the summer months. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit is the breeding pair, and monogamous pairs may persist for life. During winter, several Corsacs may gather in a single den, indicating a relatively high degree of sociality. Polygamous families may occur under favorable feeding conditions. In optimal habitats during years of high prey abundance, the home range of a family pair may be as small as 1 km ?. In contrast, home ranges are significantly larger in habitats with low food abundance, and may reach 35-40 km ?. Corsacs occupy dens, often the burrows of marmots, during the day. Dens provide shelter from weather, but may also serve as important refuges from predation by larger canids such as Wolves and Red Foxes. Scent marking is important for maintaining territories, and marking with urine and feces is most frequent near dens. Barking is the most common vocalization. Barks have many different tonal variations, and are used during courtship, territorial demonstrations, and alarm. They are higher in pitch than the barks of Red Foxes and sound similar to a cat’s mew. Close distance vocalizations include high-tone rhythmic sounds, peeping, chirping, and yelping. Breeding. Across the range of the species, mating takes place from January to early March. There is only one litter per year and gestation varies from 52 to 60 days. The earliest birth time is mid-March, most births occurring in April. Average litter size in Kazakhstan was 5-5 (range = 2-10). Pups usually emerge from dens in mid-May. At 28 days they start eating meat. The male takes an active part in parental care by feeding the young, and in favorable years helpers may assist with feeding and guarding the young. Pups reach adult size at four to five months, and in captivity sexual maturity is reached by nine months. They disperse by the end of summer, but do not venture far from their natal range, and some are likely to return to stay over the autumn-winter season. Status and Conservation. CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Current population status and the nature of major threats is unknown in most regions. Corsac Foxes were once considered ubiquitous across Central Asia, but notable declines have occurred in recent years following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. In Russia the Corsac Fox is rare in most regions, but relatively common in western Siberia and Transbaikalia. The species is common between the Volga and Ural rivers, but probably declining in Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Mongolia , and northern China . Corsac Foxes are rare in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and the south-western portion of their range. In many countries, hunting them is legal during certain seasons, but enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations rarely occurs. Over-hunting and illegal poaching (even in protected areas) remains the most significant threat to the species. In Mongolia , increased hunting for furs in recent years has depleted populations throughout the country and led the species’ listing as “near threatened” in 2006. Bibliography.

The largest fox in the genus Vulpes , with an enormous geographical variation in size. Males generally larger than females. The species is substantially smaller in the Middle East deserts than in Europe. Smaller also in North America. Muzzle slender and pointed, white on upper lip. Ears large, pointed, erect and black-backed. Pelage is reddish-brown but may vary from brown to russet red to yellowish-gray. Three main color morphs: red,silver, and cross (grayish-brown with long black guard hairs down back and across shoulders). Throat and/or chest may have white markings. Legs long and slender. Lower legs black. Tail long, thick, and bushy, sometimes with white tip. Red Foxes in North America are comparatively light weight, rather long for their mass, and with considerable sexual dimorphism. British foxes are heavier but relatively short. European foxes are closer to the general average among populations. Body mass and length are positively related to latitude (i.e. Bergmann’s Rule), but this is a smaller effect than that related to geographical origin. Dental formula 13/3, C 1/1, PM 3/4, M 3/3 = 42.","Red Foxes recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert, grassland, and forest, as well as in cities. Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with mosaics of scrub, woodland and farmland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains, deserts, sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4500 m . Red Foxes flourish in urban areas, where they are most common in low-density residential suburbs and less common in areas dominated by industry or commerce. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with humans, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. Also in large cities, including Washington DC , London, Paris, and Stockholm .","Adaptable and opportunistic omnivores, with a diet ranging from invertebrates (e.g. earthworms and beetles) to mammals, birds, fruit, and carrion. As predators, foxes typically kill birds and mammals up to about 3-5 kg . They cache food that is in excess of their requirements and have a highly developed memory for locations of hoards. They scavenge in rural areas (e.g. on deer and sheep carcasses in Europe and Canada , which may be the major food source in upland areas in winter), and in urban areas (on bird-feeding tables, compost heaps, and refuse). They are independent and thus generally solitary foragers, although individuals may forage in close proximity where resources are clumped. Activity patterns. Foraging is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, although more diurnal where undisturbed. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit is a pair, but groups with up to six members (usually one adult male and 2-5 probably related females) may share a territory, depending on habitat. Range size is habitat-dependent and can vary from less than 0-4 km ? to over 40 km ®. There are reports of overlapping home ranges in some urban and rural environments, and of drifting territories in other urban settings. Mating behavior is highly variable, either monogamous pairs, a single male with two breeding females that may or may not share a communal den, or a single breeding female with several non-breeding female helpers. There is always only one breeding male in the group, although additional matings do occur outside the group. Territorial males make frequent excursions beyond their territories during the mating season, during which itinerant males also make incursions into territories. There is socially-mediated suppression of reproduction amongst females, with lowest productivity tending to occur where fox density is high or food supply poor. Where food is not limited, social status itself can suppress reproduction, with only the dominant female breeding. Behavioral mechanisms by which this occurs include harassment of subordinates, infanticide and cannibalism of subordinate vixens’ pups. A hormonal mechanism whereby stress leads to lowered productivity through fetal reabsorption has also been identified. In populations where productivity is low, reproductive performance is suppressed consistently at all stages of pregnancy from conception to birth. Juveniles may disperse between six and twelve months of age, mostly between October and January. All or most males disperse, but the proportion of each sex dispersing varies among habitats and may depend on extent of mortality (e.g. due to rabies or control). Males typically disperse farther than females. Dispersal distances generally range from less than 5 km to more than 50 km , but distances of up to 394 km have been recorded in the USA . Red Foxes communicate with facial expressions, vocalizations, and scent marking. Scent marking involves urine and feces, anal sac secretions, the violet or supracaudal gland (more active in males during breeding season), and glands around thelips, in the angle of the jaw, and between pads of the feet. Some 28 different categories of vocalization have been described, used to communicate over long distances and at close quarters.",,"Foraging is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, although more diurnal where undisturbed.","The basic social unit is a pair, but groups with up to six members (usually one adult male and 2-5 probably related females) may share a territory, depending on habitat.

Some 28 different categories of vocalization have been described, used to communicate over long distances and at close quarters. Breeding. Males are seasonally fecund. Mating occurs between December and February (June to October in Australia ); the onset of breeding is correlated with day length and so starts earlier at more southerly latitudes. Following a gestation period of 49-55 days, births occur from March to May. Lactation lasts for four weeks, and the pups are fully weaned at 6-8 weeks. Sexual maturity is reached at 9-10 months. The proportion of breeding females in the group, andlitter size (3-12 young perlitter), varies with food availability. Fox populations that are dense relative to food resources are generally less productive than those that are less dense. A single litter per year is the norm. In high-density populations where interactions with the dominant female are high, subordinate females do not usually breed. The male provides food to the lactating female, who is generally confined to the den prior to weaning. Food is provided for the pups by both parents. Non-breeding females may also feed, groom, and tend pups and have been known to adopt orphaned pups. If two females breed within a group, they may share a den and litters may be communally suckled.","CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. V. v. necator in the Sierra Nevada , California ( USA ) is rare, possibly declining. The subspecies griffithi, montana, and pusilla (= leucopus) are listed as CITES Appendix III ( India ). Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the EU, Canada , and the Russian Federation , trapping methods are regulated. Red Fox density is highly variable, ranging within the UK from 0-025 individuals/km? in Scotland to 30/km? in some urban areas where food is superabundant. Density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is 3/km?. In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, the foxes occur at densities of 0-1/km?, and in southern Ontario , Canada at 1/km? Threats include habitat degradation and fragmentation, exploitation and persecution, and government policies. Other threats come from local, national, or international socio-economic and political factors, such as increasing human population and thus increasing development. The Red fox’s versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure its persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. There are currently bounties in Pakistan to protect game birds such as houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). On following pages: 28. Corsac Fox ( Vulpes corsac ); 29.

Foxes of European origin were introduced into E USA and Canada in the 17"" century, subsequently mixed with local subspecies. Also introduced to Australia in 1800s, and the Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ). Descriptive notes. Head-body 59-90 cm for males and 45-68 cm for females, tail 36-44 cm for males and 28-49 cm for females; weight 4-14 kg for males and 3-7 kg for females. The largest fox in the genus Vulpes , with an enormous geographical variation in size. Males generally larger than females. The species is substantially smaller in the Middle East deserts than in Europe. Smaller also in North America. Muzzle slender and pointed, white on upper lip. Ears large, pointed, erect and black-backed. Pelage is reddish-brown but may vary from brown to russet red to yellowish-gray. Three main color morphs: red,silver, and cross (grayish-brown with long black guard hairs down back and across shoulders). Throat and/or chest may have white markings. Legs long and slender. Lower legs black. Tail long, thick, and bushy, sometimes with white tip. Red Foxes in North America are comparatively light weight, rather long for their mass, and with considerable sexual dimorphism. British foxes are heavier but relatively short. European foxes are closer to the general average among populations. Body mass and length are positively related to latitude (i.e. Bergmann’s Rule), but this is a smaller effect than that related to geographical origin. Dental formula 13/3, C 1/1, PM 3/4, M 3/3 = 42. Habitat. Red Foxes recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert, grassland, and forest, as well as in cities. Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with mosaics of scrub, woodland and farmland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains, deserts, sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4500 m . Red Foxes flourish in urban areas, where they are most common in low-density residential suburbs and less common in areas dominated by industry or commerce. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with humans, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. Also in large cities, including Washington DC , London, Paris, and Stockholm . Food and Feeding. Adaptable and opportunistic omnivores, with a diet ranging from invertebrates (e.g. earthworms and beetles) to mammals, birds, fruit, and carrion. As predators, foxes typically kill birds and mammals up to about 3-5 kg . They cache food that is in excess of their requirements and have a highly developed memory for locations of hoards. They scavenge in rural areas (e.g. on deer and sheep carcasses in Europe and Canada , which may be the major food source in upland areas in winter), and in urban areas (on bird-feeding tables, compost heaps, and refuse). They are independent and thus generally solitary foragers, although individuals may forage in close proximity where resources are clumped. Activity patterns. Foraging is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, although more diurnal where undisturbed. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit is a pair, but groups with up to six members (usually one adult male and 2-5 probably related females) may share a territory, depending on habitat. Range size is habitat-dependent and can vary from less than 0-4 km ? to over 40 km ®. There are reports of overlapping home ranges in some urban and rural environments, and of drifting territories in other urban settings. Mating behavior is highly variable, either monogamous pairs, a single male with two breeding females that may or may not share a communal den, or a single breeding female with several non-breeding female helpers. There is always only one breeding male in the group, although additional matings do occur outside the group. Territorial males make frequent excursions beyond their territories during the mating season, during which itinerant males also make incursions into territories. There is socially-mediated suppression of reproduction amongst females, with lowest productivity tending to occur where fox density is high or food supply poor. Where food is not limited, social status itself can suppress reproduction, with only the dominant female breeding. Behavioral mechanisms by which this occurs include harassment of subordinates, infanticide and cannibalism of subordinate vixens’ pups. A hormonal mechanism whereby stress leads to lowered productivity through fetal reabsorption has also been identified. In populations where productivity is low, reproductive performance is suppressed consistently at all stages of pregnancy from conception to birth. Juveniles may disperse between six and twelve months of age, mostly between October and January. All or most males disperse, but the proportion of each sex dispersing varies among habitats and may depend on extent of mortality (e.g. due to rabies or control). Males typically disperse farther than females. Dispersal distances generally range from less than 5 km to more than 50 km , but distances of up to 394 km have been recorded in the USA . Red Foxes communicate with facial expressions, vocalizations, and scent marking. Scent marking involves urine and feces, anal sac secretions, the violet or supracaudal gland (more active in males during breeding season), and glands around thelips, in the angle of the jaw, and between pads of the feet. Some 28 different categories of vocalization have been described, used to communicate over long distances and at close quarters. Breeding. Males are seasonally fecund. Mating occurs between December and February (June to October in Australia ); the onset of breeding is correlated with day length and so starts earlier at more southerly latitudes. Following a gestation period of 49-55 days, births occur from March to May. Lactation lasts for four weeks, and the pups are fully weaned at 6-8 weeks. Sexual maturity is reached at 9-10 months. The proportion of breeding females in the group, andlitter size (3-12 young perlitter), varies with food availability. Fox populations that are dense relative to food resources are generally less productive than those that are less dense. A single litter per year is the norm. In high-density populations where interactions with the dominant female are high, subordinate females do not usually breed. The male provides food to the lactating female, who is generally confined to the den prior to weaning. Food is provided for the pups by both parents. Non-breeding females may also feed, groom, and tend pups and have been known to adopt orphaned pups. If two females breed within a group, they may share a den and litters may be communally suckled. Status and Conservation. CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. V. v. necator in the Sierra Nevada , California ( USA ) is rare, possibly declining. The subspecies griffithi, montana, and pusilla (= leucopus) are listed as CITES Appendix III ( India ). Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the EU, Canada , and the Russian Federation , trapping methods are regulated. Red Fox density is highly variable, ranging within the UK from 0-025 individuals/km? in Scotland to 30/km? in some urban areas where food is superabundant. Density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is 3/km?. In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, the foxes occur at densities of 0-1/km?, and in southern Ontario , Canada at 1/km? Threats include habitat degradation and fragmentation, exploitation and persecution, and government policies. Other threats come from local, national, or international socio-economic and political factors, such as increasing human population and thus increasing development. The Red fox’s versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure its persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. There are currently bounties in Pakistan to protect game birds such as houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). On following pages: 28. Corsac Fox ( Vulpes corsac ); 29.

In South Dakota , mammals accounted for 49% of prey occurrences, with Black-tailed Prairie Dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) as the primary prey item. In Kansas and Nebraska , murid rodents were the most frequently occurring prey. Insects also present, but likely to constitute only a small portion of biomass. Birds and their eggs are also consumed, as are plant materials, including prickly pear cactus fruit, wild plums, and sunflower seeds, which are consumed relatively frequently but most often in relatively small amounts. Swift Foxes are mostly solitary hunters. Caching of food has been observed. Activity patterns. Swift Foxes forage throughout the night, and show some crepuscular activity.

Swift Fox Vulpes velox French: Renard véloce / German: Prarie-Flinkfuchs / Spanish: Zorro veloz Taxonomy. Canis velox Say, 1823 , River Platte region, USA . Phenotypically and ecologically similar to V. macrotis ; interbreeding occurs in western Texas and eastern New Mexico , and some suggest these foxes are conspecific. Both are closely related to Arctic Foxes, and some authorities place the latter under Vulpes . Although significant geographic variation exists among Swift Foxes, their classification into northern (hebes) and southern ( velox ) subspecies is probably unjustified. Monotypic. Distribution. Great Plains in S Canada ( Alberta & Saskatchewan ) and USA ( Montana , and from N Wyoming and SW South Dakota to C New Mexico & NW Texas ). Descriptive notes. Head-body 50-54- 5 cm for males and 47- 5-54 cm for females,tail 25-34 cm for males and 25-30- 2 cm for females; weight 2- 2-5 kg for males and 1-6- 2-3 kg for females. One of the smallest canids; characteristic black patches on each side of the muzzle. The winter pelage is dark grayish across the back and sides extending to yellow-tan across the lowersides, legs, and the ventral surface of the tail. Black tail tip. The ventral fur is white with some buff on the chest. In summer, the fur is shorter and more rufous. The Swift Fox can be easily confused with the closely related Kit Fox. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. Habitat. Predominately short-grass and mixed-grass prairies in gently rolling or level terrain. In Kansas , Swift Foxes have been found to den and forage in fallow wheat fields. Survival rates between foxes in grassland and cropland sites were not significant ly different, suggesting that Swift Foxes may be able to adapt to such habitat in some cases.

Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands, and coastal Iceland .","The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger. In most inland areasit is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. Main prey include Lemmings, both Lemmus spp. and Dicrostonyx spp. In Fennoscandia, L. lemmus was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in feces) followed by birds ( Passeriformes, Galliformes, and Caridriiformes , 34%) and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus, 21%). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse ( Lagopus spp.) are common prey, in addition to rodents and Reindeer. Changes in Fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles. Foxes living near icefree coasts have access to inland prey and also sea birds, seal carcasses, fish, and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy. In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (Uria aalge, U. lomvia), seal carcasses, and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on Ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer. In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally. Arctic Foxes forage singly, presumably the most efficient foraging technique in view of the species’ main prey base of rodents and birds. When food is abundant, they cache food forlater use. Caches can contain single prey items or a variety of items, and sometimes include lemmings or goose eggs. Activity patterns. Arctic Foxes remain active year round. They are primarily nocturnal, but exhibit flexible activity patterns, often in accordance with main prey species. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit of the Arctic Fox is the breeding pair. Both parents take an active part in rearing the pups. For the first three weeks after birth, the pups are mostly dependent on milk and the female rarely leaves the natal den. During this time, the male provides food for the female. As meat increasingly forms a larger proportion of the pups’ diet, the roles of the parents become more similar and the female takes an active part in hunting and provisioning the pups. Non-breeding foxes, usually yearlings from the previous litter, may help. Supernumerary females generally emigrate before the pups attain independence of the den at 8-10 weeks. However, on Mednyi Island, there are permanent Arctic Fox groups comprising up to six adults , and complex social systems have also been observed on otherislands. Temporary groups of non-breeding individuals are also sometimes formed. Arctic Foxes normally are strongly territorial when breeding, with natal dens generally used by only one family group. Breeding pairs remain together in the same territory and use the same natal den for up to five years. Territories may include more than a single breeding pair, and closely related breeding pairs may even share a den. Home ranges in inland areas vary with lemming abundance ( 15-36 km ?), but generally are smaller in coastal habitats (e.g. 5-21 km ? in Alaska). On Svalbard , home range sizes range from 10 km ? to as large as 125 km ®. Home ranges of group members generally overlap widely with each other, but very little with those of neighboring groups. Scent marking of territories with urine is common. Vocalizations and postures such as an erected tail to attract the attention of conspecifics are common during territory disputes. In Alaska, seasonal migrations are reported when individuals leave breeding grounds in autumn, travel to the coast, and return in late winter or early spring. Large-scale emigrations have been recorded in Canada , Fennoscandia, and Russia . These may result from drastic reductions in food supplies, such as a population crash in lemmings.",,"Arctic Foxes remain active year round.

Large-scale emigrations have been recorded in Canada , Fennoscandia, and Russia . These may result from drastic reductions in food supplies, such as a population crash in lemmings. Breeding. Mating occurs between February and May and births take place from April to July. Gestation lasts 51-54 days and pup weight at birth is 80-85 g , but may be lower in larger litters. Litter size varies with food availability, being larger in areas with rodents. Recorded mean litter sizes at weaning varied from 2-4 (St. Paul Island) to 7-1 ( Russia ). On WrangelIsland, Russia , in years with high lemming abundance, up to 19 pups per litter have been observed. The ability of Arctic Foxes to produce large litters is facilitated by their access to large and relatively safe dens. Den sites are large, with complex burrow systems, and the largest dens are preferred for breeding. These may have up to 150 entrances and are usually situated on elevated mounds, river banks or ridges. Good denning sites lie above the permafrost layer, accumulate comparatively little winter snow and are sun-exposed, often facing south. The average lifespan of dens in the Canadian tundra has been estimated at 330 years. Some are used repeatedly, year after year, others infrequently. Pup rearing is confined to the snow-free period from June to September, after which the young gradually become independent. Lactation generally lasts 8-10 weeks. Growth rate from weaning in early July to late August has been recorded at 30-34 g /day. Foxes reach sexual maturity at ten months.","CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Arctic Fox, however, is regionally threatened in Sweden (“endangered”), Finland (“critical”) and mainland Norway (“endangered”). In 1983, following the introduction of mange caused by ear canker mites (Otodectes cynotis) transmitted by dogs, the Mednyi Island foxes were listed in the Russian Red Data Book. The world population of Arctic Foxes is on the order of several hundred thousand animals. In most areas, population status is believed to be good. The species is common in the tundra of Russia , Canada , coastal Alaska, Greenland , and Iceland . Exceptions are Fennoscandia, Mednyi Island ( Russia ), and the Pribilof Islands, where populations are at critically low levels. On the Pribilof Islands, fox populations appear to be declining further. In most of its range, the Arctic Fox is not protected. However, the species and its dens have received total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the Arctic Fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE) and is therefore given full protection. On St. Paul Island the declining population currently has no legal protection. In Norway ( Svalbard ), Greenland , Canada , Russia , and Alaska, trapping is limited to licensed trappers operating in a defined trapping season. The enforcement of trapping laws appears to be uniformly good. In Iceland , bounty hunting takes place over most of the country outside nature reserves. Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox; however, the decline of the fur industry has reduced the threat of over-exploitation for most populations. In some areas gene swamping by farm-bred Blue Foxes may threaten native populations. There can also be indirect threats such as diseases and organochlorine contaminants, or direct persecution, as occurs on St. Paul Island. Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy.","Angerbjorn, Hersteinsson & Tannerfeldt (2004) | Angerbjorn, Stroman & Becker (1997) | Angerbjorn, Tannerfeldt, Bjarvall et al.

However, on Mednyi Island, there are permanent Arctic Fox groups comprising up to six adults , and complex social systems have also been observed on otherislands. Temporary groups of non-breeding individuals are also sometimes formed. Arctic Foxes normally are strongly territorial when breeding, with natal dens generally used by only one family group. Breeding pairs remain together in the same territory and use the same natal den for up to five years. Territories may include more than a single breeding pair, and closely related breeding pairs may even share a den. Home ranges in inland areas vary with lemming abundance ( 15-36 km ?), but generally are smaller in coastal habitats (e.g. 5-21 km ? in Alaska). On Svalbard , home range sizes range from 10 km ? to as large as 125 km ®. Home ranges of group members generally overlap widely with each other, but very little with those of neighboring groups. Scent marking of territories with urine is common. Vocalizations and postures such as an erected tail to attract the attention of conspecifics are common during territory disputes. In Alaska, seasonal migrations are reported when individuals leave breeding grounds in autumn, travel to the coast, and return in late winter or early spring. Large-scale emigrations have been recorded in Canada , Fennoscandia, and Russia . These may result from drastic reductions in food supplies, such as a population crash in lemmings. Breeding. Mating occurs between February and May and births take place from April to July. Gestation lasts 51-54 days and pup weight at birth is 80-85 g , but may be lower in larger litters. Litter size varies with food availability, being larger in areas with rodents. Recorded mean litter sizes at weaning varied from 2-4 (St. Paul Island) to 7-1 ( Russia ). On WrangelIsland, Russia , in years with high lemming abundance, up to 19 pups per litter have been observed. The ability of Arctic Foxes to produce large litters is facilitated by their access to large and relatively safe dens. Den sites are large, with complex burrow systems, and the largest dens are preferred for breeding. These may have up to 150 entrances and are usually situated on elevated mounds, river banks or ridges. Good denning sites lie above the permafrost layer, accumulate comparatively little winter snow and are sun-exposed, often facing south. The average lifespan of dens in the Canadian tundra has been estimated at 330 years. Some are used repeatedly, year after year, others infrequently. Pup rearing is confined to the snow-free period from June to September, after which the young gradually become independent. Lactation generally lasts 8-10 weeks. Growth rate from weaning in early July to late August has been recorded at 30-34 g /day. Foxes reach sexual maturity at ten months. Status and Conservation. CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Arctic Fox, however, is regionally threatened in Sweden (“endangered”), Finland (“critical”) and mainland Norway (“endangered”). In 1983, following the introduction of mange caused by ear canker mites (Otodectes cynotis) transmitted by dogs, the Mednyi Island foxes were listed in the Russian Red Data Book. The world population of Arctic Foxes is on the order of several hundred thousand animals. In most areas, population status is believed to be good. The species is common in the tundra of Russia , Canada , coastal Alaska, Greenland , and Iceland . Exceptions are Fennoscandia, Mednyi Island ( Russia ), and the Pribilof Islands, where populations are at critically low levels. On the Pribilof Islands, fox populations appear to be declining further. In most of its range, the Arctic Fox is not protected. However, the species and its dens have received total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the Arctic Fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE) and is therefore given full protection. On St. Paul Island the declining population currently has no legal protection. In Norway ( Svalbard ), Greenland , Canada , Russia , and Alaska, trapping is limited to licensed trappers operating in a defined trapping season. The enforcement of trapping laws appears to be uniformly good. In Iceland , bounty hunting takes place over most of the country outside nature reserves. Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox; however, the decline of the fur industry has reduced the threat of over-exploitation for most populations. In some areas gene swamping by farm-bred Blue Foxes may threaten native populations. There can also be indirect threats such as diseases and organochlorine contaminants, or direct persecution, as occurs on St. Paul Island. Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy. Bibliography.

A small, slight animal with slender legs, a long bushy tail and conspicuouslylarge ears. Males are often slightly heavier than females. The back of the ears, front part of the snout, face mask, front and lower part of the back legs, and the mid-dorsal part of the tail are black. A whitish band extends from across the forehead up the first three quarters of the frontal rim of the ears. Some animals have a broad dark mid-dorsal band. Beige to honey-colored fur covers the lower jaw, the throat, chest, and underparts. The body and tail fur is thick and soft on the upper parts, with a black base and white tip, giving a grizzled or gray appearance. Bat-eared Foxes have 46-50 teeth, the largest number for any non-marsupial land mammal. They are unique amongst living eutherians (odontocetes excepted) in having four to five functional lower molars, and are the only modern canids with three to four upper molars. The milk dentition is typically canid, with unreduced carnassials. In adults, the carnassial shear is lost and molars become the most bunodont, verging on zalambdodont, of any canid. Supernumerary molars yield a dentition of 13/3, C 1/1, PM 4/4, M 3-4/4-5 = 46-50.","In southern Africa prime habitat is mainly short-grass plains and areas with bare ground, but foxes are also found in open scrub vegetation and arid or semi-arid shrub land and open arid savannah. The range of Bat-eared Foxes overlaps almost completely with that of termites of the Hodotermes and Microhodotermes genera that prevail in their diet. In East Africa Bat-eared Foxes are common in open grassland and woodland boundaries, but not on short-grass plains. Those areas occupied by Bateared Foxes usually contain more harvester termite (1. mossambicus) foraging holes and dung from migratory ungulates where beetles are likely to be found.","Insects are the primary food sources in open grassland and woodland edge habitats. Harvester termites and beetles are typically the most commonly consumed prey items. Diet is supplemented by orthopterans, beetle larvae, and ants. In open shrub savannahs, arachnids and fruit (consumed seasonally) may be among the more common food items. Small mammals, birds, eggs, and reptiles are eaten sporadically in southern Africa, but rarely in eastern Africa. There 1s seasonal variation in the proportion of particular taxa consumed: in the Serengeti dung beetles are the main source of food during the rainy season, when termite activity is reduced. When both beetles and termites are scarce, Bat-eared Foxes will dig up beetle larvae from the ground. Harvester termites and dung beetles are more abundant in areas inhabited by clusters of Bat-eared Fox families, and local differences in H. mossambicus density are inversely related to territory size. Although Fox water requirements may be met by the high water content of their insect prey or by berries during the summer, water is nevertheless a critical resource during lactation. Groups forage as a unit. Foraging techniques depend on prey type , but food is often located by walking slowly, nose close to the ground and ears cocked forward. Prey is detected mostly by sound and often excavated by digging. Foraging and feeding rates are higher when feeding on termite patches than on more dispersed insects. When feeding on termite patches, group members feed closely together, but when feeding on beetles, beetle larvae or grasshoppers, they can forage up to 200 m apart. Activity patterns. Changes in daily and seasonal H. mossambicus availability directly affect Bat-eared Fox activity patterns. Activity is mostly nocturnal in eastern Africa. In southern Africa, nocturnal foraging during summer gradually changes to an almost exclusively diurnal pattern in winter, in accordance with the activity changes of H. mossambicus. Diurnal foraging peaks when insect activity is highest. Bat-eared Fox groups in the Serengeti frequently patrol known Hodotermes patches in their territory after leaving the den in the evening. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In southern Africa Bat-eared Foxes live in monogamous pairs with their pups, while in eastern Africa they live in stable family groups consisting of a male and up to three closely related females with pups. Adult group size varies with the time of year, with a mean of 2-7 for southern Africa and 2-4 for eastern Africa; group size prior to pup dispersal is six. Additional females in extended family groups are usually philopatric daughters, sometimes from several generations, organized in an age-based hierarchy where all females breed. Young pups are taught to forage by the male, and social learning by pups also seemsto play a role. In the Serengeti, parents facilitate better access to H. mossambicus patches by regularly guiding the smaller and more vulnerable pups from the breeding den to “nocturnal feeding dens”. Nuclear family groups persist until cub dispersal. Home ranges vary from less than 1 km ? to more than 3 km ?. Home ranges overlap widely and may be clustered around harvester termite colonies. Territories are patrolled and urine-marked during part of the year. Group size determines the outcome of territorial conflicts. Territory inheritance is not uncommon in the Serengeti and neighboring groups can be closely related, with animals visiting each other from time to time. Foxes engage in frequent and extended allogrooming sessions, which increase markedly during courtship. Vigorous and extended social play is very common, including among adults after the young have dispersed. Communication is primarily visual, and often based on a variety of ear and tail positions.

Vocalizations are mostly soft and sparingly used, except when the Foxes are highly alarmed or excited during play. Breeding. Bat-eared Foxes become sexually mature at 8-9 months of age. Pair-bonding and mating occur from July to September, and involve up to ten copulations per day for several days. Copulatory ties last about four minutes, and are followed by post-copulatory play. Foxes have one litter per year. Births occur between October and December, following a gestation period of 60-75 days. Litter size ranges from 1-6, and neonates weigh 99-142 g . Dens are excavated or adapted from abandoned dens of other mammals, e.g. Spring hare, Aardvark, and even termite mounds and warthog (Phacochoerus spp.) holes. Dens can be located in clusters and may have several entrances, chambers, and tunnels. Small pups nurse inside the den and are sometimes moved between dens. They first emerge for brief periods when they are 8-12 days old. Dens are carefully maintained throughout the year and often used for generations. Parental care such as grooming, playing, and guarding against predators is mostly the responsibility of males. Female investment during lactation is high compared to other canids, and their insectivorous diet prevents mothers and/or pups from being provisioned directly. However, the high level of male parental care enables females to maximize their foraging time, compensating for the fact that their nutritional intake 1s limited to small, dispersed food items. Weaning (at 10-15 weeks) occurs after the first rains and the subsequent flush of insects. In Serengeti, the Bat-eared Fox commonly exhibits polygyny, communal breeding, and indiscriminate allosuckling. The number of pups raised averages 2-6, but in extended family units with more than one breeding female it averages 3-6. Sharing male partners enables additional breeding females to sustain the energetic costs associated with reproduction.","CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCNRed List. No current legal protection known. The species is common in conservation areas in southern and eastern Africa, becoming uncommon in arid areas and on farmland. Primary threats are hunting for skins, persecution as erroneously perceived predators of young lambs, and road kills. Population numbers can fluctuate from abundant to rare depending on rainfall, food availability, breeding stage and disease. Rabies and canine distemper have been reported to cause drastic population declines in some areas.","Berry (1978) | Gittleman (1989) | Guilday (1962) | Kieser (1995) | Koop & Velimirov (1982) | Kuntzsch & Nel (1992) | Lamprecht (1979) | Le Clus (1971) | Maas (1993a, 1993b) | Maas & Macdonald (2004) | Mackie (1988) | Mackie & Nel (1989) | Malcolm (1986) | Nel (1978, 1990, 1993, 1999) | Nel & Bester (1983) | Nel & Maas (2004) | Nel & Mackie (1990) | Nel et al.

In autumn and winter, race ussuriensis is very fat and has thick fur, giving an expression of a round animal with short, thin legs. Black facial mask, small rounded ears, and pointed muzzle. Hair is long on cheeks. The body color varies from yellow to gray or reddish, with black hairs on the back and shoulders and also dorsally on the tail. Legs, feet, and chest are dark. Underhair is gray or reddish. The tail is rather short and covered with thick hair. In summer when the fur is thin and fat reserves small, the animal looks much slimmer than in autumn.

Race viverrinus is similar to albus but with somewhat shorter fur, shorter hindlegs, and generally darker color. Skull and teeth are smaller than those of ussuriensis. Mandible width and jaw height for the skull and the lower and upper molars clearly distinguish the two subspecies.","Typically found near water, and during autumn, habitat selection appears to be affected by reliance on fruits and berries. In Japan , Raccoon Dog habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to sub-alpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitats and is less likely to use Cryptomeria plantations throughout the year, although riparian areas are often used. In urban environments, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover. In the Russian Far East, they avoid dense forests in favor of open landscapes, especially damp meadows and agricultural land. In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favor moist forests and shores ofrivers and lakes, especially in early summer. In late summer and autumn they favor moist heaths with abundant berries. In the Finnish archipelago, however, they prefer barren pine forests, where they feed on crowberries (Empetrum nigrum).","Raccoon Dogs are omnivores and seasonal food habits shift as food availability changes. In most areas small rodents form the bulk of their diet in all seasons. Frogs, lizards, invertebrates, insects (including adults and larvae of Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata ), and birds and their eggs are also consumed, especially in early summer. Plants are eaten frequently; berries and fruits serve as an important and favored food source in late summer and autumn, when Raccoon Dogs decrease their food intake before entering winter dormancy. Oats, sweet corn, watermelon, and other agriculture products often are found in Raccoon Dog stomachs. Carrion, fish, and crustaceans are consumed when available. As opportunistic generalists, Raccoon Dogs forage by searching close to the ground and may also climb trees for fruits. They mainly forage in pairs, usually wandering some distance from each other. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal, leaving their dens 1-2 hours after sunset. When they have pups, females also forage during the daytime while the male is babysitting. In spring, Raccoon Dogs are also seen during daytime when sunbathing on south-facing slopes ofhills. In areas where winters are harsh they enter a form of hibernation (winter lethargy) in November and become active again in March. The Raccoon Dog is the only canid known to hibernate. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Both males and females defend their home range against individuals of the same sex. Home range size varies according to the abundance of food. The core areas of different pairs are fully exclusive, especially during the breeding season. Peripheral areas of home ranges may overlap to some extent. In autumn there is more overlap than in spring and summer. Different pairs seem to avoid each other even when their home ranges partially overlap. Resting sites may be shared with related family members, and latrine sites may be shared by several individuals. Home range sizes in Russia vary from 0-4- 20 km ? (larger ranges in introduced populations in western Russia ). In southern Finland , home ranges recorded by radio-tracking ranged from 2-8 to 7 km ®. In Japan , home range size varies from as little as 0-07 km? in an urban setting to 6- 1 km ? in a sub-alpine area. Strictly monogamous, the male and female form a permanent pair, sharing a home range and foraging together. Only if one of the pair dies will the remaining member form a new pair bond. Some non-paired adults may stay within the same area and/or share the resting or feeding sites or dens, but usually do not move together. Raccoon Dogs do not bark, but growl when menaced.

In Japan their vocalizations are higher in tone than those of a domestic dog and more or less resemble the sounds of a domestic cat. Breeding. Testosterone levels in males peak in February/March, and progesterone levels in females coincide even with absence of males, suggesting that the species is monoestrous, with seasonal and spontaneous ovulation. Raccoon Dogs reach sexual maturity at 9-11 months and can breed in the first year, but a first-year female will enter estrus more than one month later than older females. Females can reproduce every year. Mating usually occurs in March, and the onset of spring and the length of winter lethargy determine the time of ovulation. Mating occurs in the back-to-back copulatory posture typical of other canids. Gestation period is nine weeks, parturition mostly occurring in May (varies from April to June). The parents settle in a den about a week before the pups are born. Raccoon Dogs will den in old European Badger (Meles meles) setts or fox dens, or alternatively dig their own dens in soft sandy soil. They will also use active Badgersetts, usually together with Badgers. Winter dens usually are located within their home range, but if suitable dens are not available, they may be several kilometers outside the summer home range. Mean litter size varies between four and five in Japan (birth weight approximately 100 g ) to nine in Finland and Poland (birth weight about 120 g ), and also in the original distribution area in south-eastern Russia . Litter size in north-western Russia is smaller (6-7) on average because of the harsh winters. Litter size is affected by the abundance of wild berries: when berries are abundant, females are in good condition the following spring, and fetal mortality is low and litter sizes are large. At higher latitudes, the young are born later and remain small and slim in late autumn, and may not reproduce the following spring. Therefore, the productivity of the population is lower in areas with long winters compared to areas with milder climates. Pups start emerging from the den at three to four weeks of age and are weaned at about one week later. Both sexes exhibit parental care, taking turns attending the den during the early nursing period. Because the food items of Raccoon Dogs are small, food is not carried to the den. The pups are fed with milk until they start to forage for themselves. The young usually reach adult body size by the first autumn.","CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. In many countries where the Raccoon Dog is hunted legally, hunting is permitted year round (e.g. Sweden , Hungary and Poland ). However, in Finland females with pups are protected in May, June, and July, in Belarus hunting is allowed from October to February, and in Mongolia hunting requires a license and is allowed only from October to February. In Japan , hunting and trapping of the species also requires a license or other form of permission and is restricted to a designated hunting season. Species abundance is unknown in the Far East outside ofJapan, where it is considered common. In its European range the species is common to abundant, although rare in Denmark and Sweden . Threats across its range include road kills, persecution, government attitudes, epidemics (scabies, distemper, and rabies), and pollution.","Bannikov (1964) | Fukue (1991, 1993) | Helle & Kauhala (1995) | Ikeda (1982, 1983) | Kauhala (1992, 1996) | Kauhala & Auniola (2000) | Kauhala & Helle (1995) | Kauhala & Saeki (2004) | Kauhala, Helle & Pietila (1998) | Kauhala, Helle & Taskinen (1993) | Kauhala, Kaunisto & Helle (1993) | Kauhala, Laukkanen & von Rége (1998) | Korhonen (1988) | Korhonen et al.

Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides French: Tanuki / German: Marderhund / Spanish: Perro mapache Other common names: Tanuki Taxonomy. Canis procyonoides Gray, 1834 , Canton, China . The Raccoon Dog lineage probably diverged from other canids as early as 7-10 million years ago. Some features of the skull resemble those of South American canids, especially the Crab-eating Fox ( Cerdocyon thous ), but genetic studies have revealed that they are not close relatives. Six subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. N. p. procyonoides Gray, 1834 — W & SW China and N Indochina. N. p. albus Hornaday, 1904 — Japan ( Hokkaido ). N. p. koreensis Mori, 1922 — Korean Peninsula. N. p. orestes Thomas, 1923 — C & S China . N. p. ussuriensis Matschie, 1907 — NE China , E Mongolia , and SE Russia . N. p. viverrinus Temminck, 1839 — Japan . Introduced (ussuriensis) to the Baltic states, Belarus , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Finland , Germany , Hungary , Moldova , Poland , Romania , W Russia , Serbia , Slovakia , Sweden , and Ukraine , occasionally seen in Austria , Bosnia , Denmark , France , the Netherlands , Norway , Slovenia , and Switzerland . Descriptive notes. Head-body 49-2-70- 5 cm for males and 50- 5-69 cm for females, tail 15-23 cm for males and 15-20- 5 cm for females; weight 2:9-12- 4 kg for males and 3-12- 5 kg for females. In autumn and winter, race ussuriensis is very fat and has thick fur, giving an expression of a round animal with short, thin legs. Black facial mask, small rounded ears, and pointed muzzle. Hair is long on cheeks. The body color varies from yellow to gray or reddish, with black hairs on the back and shoulders and also dorsally on the tail. Legs, feet, and chest are dark. Underhair is gray or reddish. The tail is rather short and covered with thick hair. In summer when the fur is thin and fat reserves small, the animal looks much slimmer than in autumn. Dental formula 1s13/3,C1/1, PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42; M, sometimes missing. Body size of race albus is smaller than that of ussuriensis. Race viverrinus is similar to albus but with somewhat shorter fur, shorter hindlegs, and generally darker color. Skull and teeth are smaller than those of ussuriensis. Mandible width and jaw height for the skull and the lower and upper molars clearly distinguish the two subspecies. Habitat. Typically found near water, and during autumn, habitat selection appears to be affected by reliance on fruits and berries. In Japan , Raccoon Dog habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to sub-alpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitats and is less likely to use Cryptomeria plantations throughout the year, although riparian areas are often used. In urban environments, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover. In the Russian Far East, they avoid dense forests in favor of open landscapes, especially damp meadows and agricultural land. In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favor moist forests and shores ofrivers and lakes, especially in early summer. In late summer and autumn they favor moist heaths with abundant berries. In the Finnish archipelago, however, they prefer barren pine forests, where they feed on crowberries (Empetrum nigrum). Food and Feeding. Raccoon Dogs are omnivores and seasonal food habits shift as food availability changes. In most areas small rodents form the bulk of their diet in all seasons. Frogs, lizards, invertebrates, insects (including adults and larvae of Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata ), and birds and their eggs are also consumed, especially in early summer. Plants are eaten frequently; berries and fruits serve as an important and favored food source in late summer and autumn, when Raccoon Dogs decrease their food intake before entering winter dormancy.

Side-striped Jackals frequently occur near rural dwellings and farm buildings, and penetrate suburban and urban areas. Where Side-striped Jackals occur sympatrically with Golden and Black-backed Jackals, they may avoid competition by ecological segregation. In such areas of sympatry, Side-striped Jackals usually occupy areas of denser vegetation, and Black-backed and Golden Jackals dominate in the more open areas.","Omnivorous, with a diet that is responsive to both seasonal and local variation in food availability. On commercial farmland in the Zimbabwe highveld, they eat mainly wild fruit (30%) and small (less than 1 kg ) to medium-sized (more than 1 kg ) mammals (27% and 23%, respectively). The remainder of their diet comprises birds, invertebrates, cattle cake, grass, and carrion. In wildlife areas of western Zimbabwe , Side-stripedJackals feed largely on invertebrates during the wet season and small mammals up to the size of Spring hares (Pedetes capensis) during the dry months of the year. They scavenge extensively from safari camp rubbish dumps and occasionally from large carnivore kills (although they are often out-competed for this resource by Black-backed Jackals). In the Ngorongoro Crater, Side-striped Jackals have been recorded competing with Black-backed Jackals for Grant's Gazelle (Nanger granti) fawns. Their diet may consist exclusively of certain fruits when in season. Apparently less predatory than other jackals, although according to one authority this may not hold when prey is highly available. The species forages solitarily, although in western Zimbabwe family groups have been observed feeding together on abundant resources, and as many as twelve have been counted at kills or scavenging offal outside towns. Jackals have been described foraging opportunistically, exploiting food-rich habitats by random walks, and they display an amazing ability to find food where none seems obvious to the human observer. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal, but can employ extremely flexible foraging strategies in areas where they are persecuted. May also adapt activity pattern to reduce competition when in sympatry with Black-backed Jackals. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Side-striped Jackals occur solitarily, in pairs and in family groups of up to seven individuals. The basis of the family unit is the mated pair, which has been known to be stable over several years. In game areas of western Zimbabwe , home ranges varied seasonally from 0-2 km ? (hot dry season) to 1-2 km ?* (cold dry season), whereas in highveld farmland, home ranges were seasonally stable and in excess of 4 km ? (a third of the yearly total range). Sub-adults disperse from the natal territory, up to 12 km in Zimbabwe's highveld farmland and 20 km in game areas. In highveld farmland, territories are configured to encompass patches of grassland where resources are most available, and the structure of the habitat mosaic appears an important factor. Home ranges overlap by about 20% in highveld farmland and 33% in game areas. The residents use the core territory almost exclusively. Vocal repertoire is broad, including an explosive bark, growls, yaps, cackles, whines, screams, a croaking distress call, and a hooting howl. Calling occurs all year round, but is especially common between pair members during the mating period. Jackals from neighboring territories sometimes answer each other.

Captive pups have been heard calling at eight weeks, but may start earlier. Breeding. In Zimbabwe , mating occurs mostly during June and July, and the gestation period is about 60 days. Litters of 4-6 pups are born from August to November, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. Pup mortality is thought to be high. Abandoned Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) holes or excavated termitaria are common den sites, with the den chamber occurring 0-75— 1 m below the surface and 2-3 m from the entrance. The same pair may use such dens in consecutive years. After the pups are weaned, both parents assist in rearing them, returning at two- to three-hour intervals through the night to feed the pups on food that is probably regurgitated. The pups are aggressive towards each other, as evidenced by the degree of wounding observed. Yearold offspring remain in the parental territory while additional offspring are raised. It appears likely that alloparental care as observed in other jackals also occurs in this species, which may be more social than previously thought.","CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. No legal protection outside protected areas. Regional estimates of population abundance are not available, but from work undertaken in two diverse habitats in Zimbabwe , it seems reasonable to assume the species is common and to estimate a total population in excess of three million. The species appears well capable of exploiting urban and suburban habitats, a factor which may help to ensure its persistence. It is likely that the population is at least stable. Side-striped Jackals are persecuted because of their role in rabies transmission and their putative role as stock killers. In areas of high human population density, snaring may be the commonest cause of death in adult jackals. It is unlikely that this persecution has an effect on the overall population, but indiscriminate culling through poisoning could affect local abundance. The species’ dietary flexibility and ability to co-exist with humans on the periphery of settlements and towns suggests that populations are only vulnerable in cases of extreme habitat modification or intense disease epidemics.","Atkinson (1997a, 1997b) | Atkinson & Loveridge (2004) | Atkinson, Macdonald & Kamizola (2002) | Atkinson, Rhodes et al.

Sub-adults disperse from the natal territory, up to 12 km in Zimbabwe's highveld farmland and 20 km in game areas. In highveld farmland, territories are configured to encompass patches of grassland where resources are most available, and the structure of the habitat mosaic appears an important factor. Home ranges overlap by about 20% in highveld farmland and 33% in game areas. The residents use the core territory almost exclusively. Vocal repertoire is broad, including an explosive bark, growls, yaps, cackles, whines, screams, a croaking distress call, and a hooting howl. Calling occurs all year round, but is especially common between pair members during the mating period. Jackals from neighboring territories sometimes answer each other. Captive pups have been heard calling at eight weeks, but may start earlier. Breeding. In Zimbabwe , mating occurs mostly during June and July, and the gestation period is about 60 days. Litters of 4-6 pups are born from August to November, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. Pup mortality is thought to be high. Abandoned Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) holes or excavated termitaria are common den sites, with the den chamber occurring 0-75— 1 m below the surface and 2-3 m from the entrance. The same pair may use such dens in consecutive years. After the pups are weaned, both parents assist in rearing them, returning at two- to three-hour intervals through the night to feed the pups on food that is probably regurgitated. The pups are aggressive towards each other, as evidenced by the degree of wounding observed. Yearold offspring remain in the parental territory while additional offspring are raised. It appears likely that alloparental care as observed in other jackals also occurs in this species, which may be more social than previously thought. Status and Conservation. CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. No legal protection outside protected areas. Regional estimates of population abundance are not available, but from work undertaken in two diverse habitats in Zimbabwe , it seems reasonable to assume the species is common and to estimate a total population in excess of three million. The species appears well capable of exploiting urban and suburban habitats, a factor which may help to ensure its persistence. It is likely that the population is at least stable. Side-striped Jackals are persecuted because of their role in rabies transmission and their putative role as stock killers. In areas of high human population density, snaring may be the commonest cause of death in adult jackals. It is unlikely that this persecution has an effect on the overall population, but indiscriminate culling through poisoning could affect local abundance. The species’ dietary flexibility and ability to co-exist with humans on the periphery of settlements and towns suggests that populations are only vulnerable in cases of extreme habitat modification or intense disease epidemics.

These range from the Sahel to the evergreen forests of Myanmar and Thailand . Golden Jackals occupy semi-desert, short to medium grasslands and savannahs in Africa, and forested, mangrove, agricultural, rural, and semi-urban habitats in India and Bangladesh . Golden Jackals are opportunistic and will venture into human habitation at night to feed on garbage. They have been recorded at elevations of 3800 m in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia and are well established around hill stations at 2000 m in India .","An omnivorous and opportunistic forager, the Golden Jackal’s diet varies according to season and habitat. According to one study in east Africa, although they consume invertebrates and fruit, over 60% of Golden Jackal diet consisted of rodents, lizards, snakes, birds (from quail to flamingoes), hares, and Thomson's Gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni). In India , over 60% of the diet comprised rodents, birds, and fruit in Bharatpur, while in Kanha over 80% ofthe diet consisted of rodents, reptiles, and fruit. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, India , scat analysis (n = 36) revealed that Golden Jackal diet included mainly mammals (45% occurrence, of which 36% was rodents), vegetable matter (20%), birds (19%), and reptiles and invertebrates (8% each). Golden Jackals often ingest large quantities of vegetable matter, and during the fruiting season in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Ziziphus sp., Carissa carvanda, Syzigium cuminii, and pods of Prosopis juliflora and Cassia fistula. Single jackals typically hunt smaller prey like rodents, hares, and birds. They use their hearing to locate rodents in the grass and then leap in the air and pounce on them; they also dig out Indian Gerbils (7atera indica) from their burrows. They have been observed to hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates that are sometimes 4-5 times their body weight. Although Golden Jackals are able to hunt alone, cooperative hunting in small packs of 2—4 individuals is often more successful and permits them to kill larger prey, including antelope fawns and langur monkeys (Presbytis pileata and P. entellus). Groups of 5-18 Golden Jackals have been sighted scavenging on carcasses of large ungulates, and there is a report of similar aggregations on clumped food resources in Israel . In several areas of India and Bangladesh , jackals subsist primarily by scavenging on carrion and garbage. They also cache food. Activity patterns. Golden Jackals are mainly nocturnal, but have flexible activity patterns and may be active during the day. During Blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) calving peaks in Velavadar National Park, India , for example, jackals were observed searching throughout the day for calves in hiding, searches intensifying during the early morning and late evening. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The social organization of Golden Jackals is extremely flexible and depends on the availability and distribution of food resources. The basic social unit is the breeding pair, which is sometimes accompanied by its current litter of pups and/or by offspring from formerlitters. In Tanzania breeding pairs usually form long-term bonds, and both members mark and defend their territories, hunt together, share food, and cooperatively rear the young. Of a total of 270 recorded jackal sightings in the Bhal and Kutch areas of Gujarat , India , 35% consisted of two individuals, 14% of three, 20% of more than three, and the rest of single individuals. Average group sizes have been reported as 2-5 (Serengeti, Tanzania ) and 3 (Velavadar National Park, India ). Scent marking by urination and defecation is common around denning areas and on intensively used trails, and is thought to play an important role in territorial defense. Recent telemetry data from the Bhal area in India suggest that most breeding pairs are spaced well apart and likely maintain a core territory around their dens. Feeding ranges of several Golden Jackals in the Bhal overlapped. Jackals were observed to range over large distances in search of food and suitable habitat, and linear forays of 12-15 km in a single night were not uncommon. Non-breeding members of a pack may stay near a distant food source like a carcass for several days prior to returning to their original range. Recorded home range sizes vary from 1- 1-20 km ? depending on the distribution and abundance of food resources. Greeting ceremonies, grooming, and group vocalizations are common social interactions. Vocalizations consist of a complex howl repertoire beginning with two to three simple, low-pitched howls and culminating in a high-pitched staccato ofcalls. Jackals are easily induced to howl. A single howl usually evokes responses from several jackals in the vicinity. In the presence of large carnivores, Golden Jackals often emit a warning call that is very different from their normal howling repertoire. In India , howling is more frequent between December and April, a time when pair bonds are being established and breeding occurs, perhaps suggesting a role in mate attraction, mate guarding, or territory defense.",,"Golden Jackals are mainly nocturnal, but have flexible activity patterns and may be active during the day.

Breeding. Reproductive activity occurs from February to March in India and Turkmenistan , and from October to March in Israel . In Tanzania , mating typically occurs from October to December, with pups being born from December to March. Timing of births coincides with abundance of food supply; for example, at the beginning of the monsoon season in northern and central India , and with the calving of Thomson's Gazelle in the Serengeti. Females are typically monoestrous, but there is evidence in Tanzania of multiple litters. Gestation lasts about 63 days. Meanlitter size has been recorded as 5-7 (range 1-8) in Tanzania . In the Bhal area in India average litter size was 3-6 (range 2-5). In Tanzania , two pups on average have been recorded emerging from the den at three weeks of age. Golden Jackals in India excavate their dens in late April to May, mainly in natural and man-made embankments, usually in scrub habitat. Rivulets, gullies, road, and check-dam embankments are prime denning habitats, and drainage pipes and culverts are also used. Dens may have 1-3 openings and typically are about 2-3 m long and 0-5- 1 m deep. In Tanzania both parents and “helpers” (offspring from previous litters) provision and guard the new pups, which results in higher pup survival. The male also feeds his mate during her pregnancy, and both the male and “helpers” (i.e. other social group members) provision the female during the period of lactation.","CITES Appendix II ( India ). Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Jackals are on Schedule III of India’s Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and are afforded the least legal protection (mainly to control trade of pelts and tails). However, no hunting of any wildlife is permitted under the current legal system in India . Fairly common throughout its range, although considered to be steadily declining except in protected areas. High densities are observed in areas with abundant food and cover. Known density estimates for parts of India enable a minimum population estimate of over 80,000 Golden Jackals for the Indian sub-continent. Population estimates for Africa are not available, but densities in the Serengeti National Park have been recorded as high as 4 adults /km?®. Traditional land use practices such as livestock rearing and dry farming are conducive to the survival of jackals and other wildlife, but are being steadily replaced by industrialization and intensive agriculture; similarly, wilderness areas and rural landscapes are being rapidly urbanized. Jackal populations adapt to some extent to these changes and may persist for a while, but will eventually disappear from such areas. There are no other known threats, except for local policies of extirpation and poisoning.","Coetzee (1977) | Fuller et al.

Originally placed in the genus Simenia, C. simensis was noted to be the most distinct species in the genus Canis , and was considered to bear close affinity to C. adustus and Dusicyon spp. The Ethiopian Wolf is not closely linked to the Vulpes group, despite having been called the Simien or Simenian Fox. Its other name of Simien or Ethiopian Jackal suggests a close relationship with jackals. Other, previously used vernacular names included Abyssinian Wolf and Red Fox, making clear the difficulty naturalists had in cataloguing this species. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA sequencing suggested that C. simensis is more closely related to C. lupus and C. latrans than to any African canid, and that the species may have evolved from a Wolf-like ancestor crossing to northern Africa from Eurasia as recently as 100,000 years ago. There are fossils of wolf-like canids from the late Pleistocene in Eurasia, but unfortunately no fossil record of C. simensis itself. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA variability in C. simensis is small relative to other canid species, suggesting small population sizes may have characterized its recent evolution.

A medium-sized canid with a reddish coat, distinctive white markings, long legs, and an elongated muzzle, resembling a Coyote in conformation and size. Males weigh 20% more than females. The face, ears and upper parts of the muzzle are red. Ears broad, pointed, and directed forward; the pinnae are thickly fringed with long white hairs growing inward from the edge. Palate, gums, and naked borders of the lips entirely black. Characteristic facial markings include a white ascending crescent below the eyes, and a small white spot on the cheeks. The throat, chest, and underparts are white, the ventral part of the neck with a distinctive white band. Pelage is soft and short, ocher to rusty red, with a dense whitish to pale ginger underfur. The boundary between the red coat and the white markings is sharp and well defined. The contrast of white markings against the red coat increases with age and social rank in both sexes; the female’s coat is generally paler than the male’s. The long, slender legs are reddish outside, with inner aspect white.

However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3500-3800 m in many areas, restricting the wolves to higher ranges. Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1000 and 2000 mm /year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March. Wolves utilize all Afro-alpine habitats, but prefer open areas with short herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, along flat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are characterized by short herbs (Alchemilla spp.) and grasses, and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result of Ethiopian African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (Festuca spp., Agrostis spp.), high-altitude shrubs dominated by Helichrysum spp., and short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern parts of the range, plant communities characterized by a matrix of “guassa” tussock grasses (Festuca spp.), “cherenfi” bushes (Euryops pinifolius) and giant lobelias (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) sustain high rodent abundance and are preferred by wolves. Ericaceous moorlands (Erica and Phillipia spp.) at 3200-3600 m are of marginal value, whereas open moorlands containing patches of herbs and grasses offer relatively good habitat.","Ethiopian Wolves feed almost exclusively upon diurnal rodents of the high-altitude Afro-alpine grassland community. In the Bale Mountains, diurnal rodents accounted for 96% of all prey occurrences in feces, with 87% belonging to three Bale endemic species: the Ethiopian African Mole Rat ( 300-930 g ), Blick’s Grass Rat ( Arvicanthis blicki ), and the Black-clawed Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys melanonyx ). Other prey species include the Ethiopian Vlei Rat ( Otomys typus ), Ethiopian Buff-spotted Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys flavopunctatus ), Ethiopian Highland Hare (Lepus starcki), and occasionally goslings and eggs. On occasion, wolves were observed feeding on Rock Hyrax (Procavia capensis), and young of Bush Duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), Common Reedbuck (Redunca redunca), and Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni). Sedge leaves (Carex monostachya) are occasionally ingested, probably to assist digestion or control parasites. Where the Ethiopian African Mole Ratis absent (i.e. Gaysay montane grassland in Bale and Menz), it is replaced in the wolf diet by the smaller Northeast African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes splendens). Similarly, in northern Ethiopia Arvicanthis abyssinicus and Lophuromysflavopunctatus replace their respective endemic relatives (A. blickiand L. melanonyx) from Bale. Elsewhere, O. typus , a rare prey item in Bale and Menz, was identified as the commonest prey in droppings collected in the otherfive populations. The same study confirmed that wolves are specialized hunters of diurnal rodents throughout their distribution, but that there is also some degree of variation in diet composition along climatic-induced gradients. Although the Ethiopian Wolfis primarily a solitary rodent hunter, it can also hunt cooperatively. Occasionally, small packs have been seen chasing young antelopes, lambs, and hares and making kills. Ethiopian Wolves will take carrion or feed on carcasses; in fact, a sheep carcass is the most successful bait for attracting wolves. The local name “jedalla farda”—the horse’s Jjackal—refers to wolves’ habit of following mares and cows about to give birth so they can eat the afterbirth. In areas of grazing in Bale, wolves were often seen foraging among herds ofcattle, a tactic that may aid in ambushing rodents out oftheir holes, by using the herd as a mobile hide. Wolves carefully explore rich food patches by walking slowly and pausing frequently to investigate holes or to localize the rodents by means of their excellent hearing. Once the prey is located they move with short, stealthy steps alternating with short periods of immobility, sometimes with belly pressed flat to the ground. The quarry is grabbed with the mouth after a short dash. A stalk can last from seconds to up to an hour, especially if the quarry is an Ethiopian African Mole Rat. Occasionally, wolves run in zig-zag through rat colonies, grabbing the rodents in passing. Digging prey out is common and is the favored technique to catch Ethiopian African Mole Rats. In such cases, hunting effort varies from a few scratches at a rat hole to the total destruction of a set of burrows, leaving mounds of earth often up to one meter high. Sometimes, digging serves to reach a nest of grassrats. Kills are often cached and later retrieved. Activity patterns. In Bale, wolves are mostly diurnal. Packs congregate for social greetings and border patrols at dawn, around midday and in the evening, and rest together at night, but break up to forage individually in the morning and early afternoon. Peaks of foraging activity suggest a synchronization with the aboveground activity of rodents. There is little nocturnal activity, wolves seldom moving far from their evening resting site. They may become more crepuscular and nocturnal where human interference 1s severe. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Ethiopian Wolves live in packs of 3- 13 adults , in discrete and cohesive social units that share and defend an exclusive territory. Annual home ranges of eight packs monitored for four years averaged 6 km ? with some overlap. Home ranges in an area of lower prey biomass averaged 13- 4 km ? (n = 4). Overlap and aggressive encounters between packs were highest during the mating season. Dispersal movements are tightly constrained by the scarcity ofsuitable habitat. Males do not disperse and are recruited into multi-male philopatric packs; some females disperse at two years of age and become “floaters”, occupying narrow ranges between pack territories until a breeding vacancy becomes available. Breeding females are typically replaced after death by a resident daughter. Pack adult sex ratio is biased toward males 1-8:1, with small family groups closer to 1:1. Wolves commonly advertize and maintain their territories by scent marking territory boundaries with urine posts, scratching, feces (deposited on conspicuoussites like mounds, rocks, and bushes), and by means of vocalizations. All pack members, independent of social rank, regularly scent-mark objects along territory boundaries with raised-leg urinations and scratches. Aggressive interactions with neighboring packs are common, highly vocal, and always end with the smaller group fleeing from the larger. Vocalizations can be grouped into two categories: alarm calls, given at the scent or sight of humans, dogs, or unfamiliar wolves; and greeting calls, given at the reunion of pack members and to advertize pack size, composition, and position. Alarm calls start with a “huff” (rapid expulsion of air through mouth and nose), followed by a quick succession of highpitched yelps and barks. These sounds can also be made as contact calls, and often attract nearby pack mates. Greeting calls include a threatening growl, a high-frequency whine of submission, and intense “group yip-howls”. Lone and group howling are long-distance calls used to contact pack members, and can be heard up to 5 km away. Howling by one pack of wolves may stimulate howling in adjacent packs. Communal calls muster pack members before a border patrol.",,"In Bale, wolves are mostly diurnal.

Communal calls muster pack members before a border patrol. Breeding. The only detailed information available on the reproductive habits of these animals comes from four years of observations of nine wild packs in the Bale Mountains. Pre-copulatory behavior by the dominant female includes an increased rate of scent marking, play-inducing and food-begging behavior towards the dominant male, and agonistic behavior towards subordinate females. The receptive period is synchronized in sympatric females to less than two weeks. Courtship may take place between adult members of a pack or with members of neighboring packs. After a brief courtship, which primarily involves the dominant male permanently accompanying the female, wolves copulate over a period of three to five days. Copulation involves a copulatory tie lasting up to 15 minutes. Other males may stand by a tied pair with no signs of aggression. Females exert mate preference, discouraging mating attempts from all but the pack’s dominant male, either by defensive snarls or moving away. Females are receptive to any visiting male from neighboring packs, and one study found that 70% of matings (n = 30) involved males from outside the pack. The dominant female of each pack gives birth once a year between October and January. Only about 60% of females breed successfully each year. During breeding and pregnancy, the female coat turns pale yellow and becomes woolly, and the tail turns brownish, and loses much ofits hair. Gestation lasts 60-62 days (based on the time from last day of mating to parturition). Pups are born in a den dug by the female in open ground, under a boulder or inside a rocky crevice. Neonates are born with their eyes closed. The natal coat is charcoal gray with a buff patch in chest and inguinal regions. Two to seven pups emerge from the den after three weeks. At this time, the dark natal coat begins to be replaced by the pelage typical of the species. Pups are regularly moved between dens up to 1300 m apart. In eight out of 18 observed natal dens, a subordinate female assisted the mother in suckling the pups. At least 50% of extra nursing females showed signs of pregnancy and may have lost or deserted their own offspring before joining the dominant female’s den. Five and six placental scars were counted in the uteri of two of these females. Development of the young takes place in three stages: early nesting (weeks 1-4), when the young are entirely dependent on milk; mixed nutritional dependency (weeks 5-10), when milk is supplemented by solid foods regurgitated by all pack members until pups are completely weaned; and postweaning dependency (week ten to six months), when the pups subsist almost entirely on solid foods supplied by helpers. Adults have been observed providing food to juveniles up to one year old. Juveniles join adults in patrols as early as six months of age, but do not urinate with a raised leg until eleven months, if male, or 18 months, if female. Yearlings attain 80-90% of adult body mass, and full adult appearance is reached at two years. Both sexes become sexually mature during their second year.","CITES not listed. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Full official protection under Ethiopia’s Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI. Killing a wolf carries a sentence of imprisonment for up to two years. There is an estimated global population of 500 adults , of which more than half live in the Bale Mountains, where wolf density is high for a social carnivore ofits size, ranging from 0- 1 adults /km® (ericaceous heath lands and barren peaks) to 1-1- 2 adults /km? (short Afro-alpine herbaceous communities). Elsewhere overall wolf density is lower; e.g. transect data from the region of Menz estimated wolf density at 0-2 animals per km?*. Recent comprehensive surveys indicate high abundance figures in North Wollo (0-20 sightings per km), intermediate in Arsi and Guna (0-10-0-11 and 0-10-0-14, respectively), and lower in South Wollo and Simien (0-08-0-13 and 0-06— 0-11, respectively). These results were supported by counts of wolf signs (diggings and droppings) and interviews with local residents. Continuous loss of habitat due to highaltitude subsistence agriculture is the major threat. Sixty percent of all land above 3200 m has been converted into farmland, and all wolf populations below 3700 m are particularly vulnerable to further habitat loss, especially in small and relatively flat areas. Habitat loss is exacerbated by overgrazing of highland pastures by domestic livestock, and in some areas habitat is threatened by proposed development of commercial sheep farms and roads. Human persecution triggered in the past by political instability is currently less severe and is associated with conflicts over livestock losses. Recent wolf population decline in Bale is mostly due to disease epizootics, with road kills and shootings as secondary threats. Rabies is a potential threatto all populations. Most of these threats are exacerbated by the wolves’ specialization to life in the Afroalpine ecosystem. In Bale, the Ethiopian Wolf hybridizes with domestic dogs. Although hybrids are currently confined to the Web Valley in West Bale, they may threaten the genetic integrity of the wolf population. Following hybridization, a population may be affected by outbreeding depression or reduction in fitness, although to date this does not seem to have taken place in Bale. To date there is no indication of hybridization taking place outside West Bale.","Ashenafi et al. (2005) | Clutton-Brock et al. (1976) | Gottelli & Sillero-Zubiri (1992) | Gottelli, Marino et al.

Ethiopian Wolf Canis simensis French: Loup d'Abyssinie / German: Athiopien-Wolf / Spanish: Lobo etiope Other common names: Simien Fox , Simien Jackal , Abyssinian Wolf , Abyssinian Red Fox Taxonomy. Canis simensis Ruppell, 1835 , Ethiopia . Originally placed in the genus Simenia, C. simensis was noted to be the most distinct species in the genus Canis , and was considered to bear close affinity to C. adustus and Dusicyon spp. The Ethiopian Wolf is not closely linked to the Vulpes group, despite having been called the Simien or Simenian Fox. Its other name of Simien or Ethiopian Jackal suggests a close relationship with jackals. Other, previously used vernacular names included Abyssinian Wolf and Red Fox, making clear the difficulty naturalists had in cataloguing this species. Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA sequencing suggested that C. simensis is more closely related to C. lupus and C. latrans than to any African canid, and that the species may have evolved from a Wolf-like ancestor crossing to northern Africa from Eurasia as recently as 100,000 years ago. There are fossils of wolf-like canids from the late Pleistocene in Eurasia, but unfortunately no fossil record of C. simensis itself. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA variability in C. simensis is small relative to other canid species, suggesting small population sizes may have characterized its recent evolution. Two subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. C. s. stmensis Ruppell, 1835 — NW of Ethiopia’s Rift Valley. C. s. citernii de Beaux, 1922 — SE of Ethiopia’s Rift Valley. Descriptive notes. Head-body 92-8-101- 2 cm for males and 84- 1-96 cm for females, tail 29-39- 6 cm for males and 27-29- 7 cm for females; weight 14-2-19- 3 kg for males and 11-2-14- 2 kg for females. A medium-sized canid with a reddish coat, distinctive white markings, long legs, and an elongated muzzle, resembling a Coyote in conformation and size. Males weigh 20% more than females. The face, ears and upper parts of the muzzle are red. Ears broad, pointed, and directed forward; the pinnae are thickly fringed with long white hairs growing inward from the edge. Palate, gums, and naked borders of the lips entirely black. Characteristic facial markings include a white ascending crescent below the eyes, and a small white spot on the cheeks. The throat, chest, and underparts are white, the ventral part of the neck with a distinctive white band. Pelage is soft and short, ocher to rusty red, with a dense whitish to pale ginger underfur. The boundary between the red coat and the white markings is sharp and well defined. The contrast of white markings against the red coat increases with age and social rank in both sexes; the female’s coat is generally paler than the male’s. The long, slender legs are reddish outside, with inner aspect white. There is a short rufouscolored stripe at the base of the tail, which becomes a black stripe leading to a thick brush of black-tipped guard hairs. The skull is very flat in profile, with only a shallow angle between frontals and nasals. The neuro-cranium is low and narrow, thick, and almost cylindrical. Its width is 30% of the total skull length. Facial length is 58% ofthe total skull length. The inter-parietal crest is slightly developed, and the coronal ridge is linear. Teeth small and widely spaced, especially the premolars. The dental formula is13/3,C1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42; m3 occasionally absent. Sharply pointed canines average 19 mm in length ( 14-22 mm ); carnassials (P* and M,) are relatively small. Habitat. A very localized endemic species, confined to isolated pockets of Afro-alpine grasslands and heath lands, where they prey on Afro-alpine rodents. Suitable habitats are above the tree-line, from about 3200 to 4500 m , with some wolves present in montane grasslands at 3000 m . However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3500-3800 m in many areas, restricting the wolves to higher ranges. Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1000 and 2000 mm /year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March. Wolves utilize all Afro-alpine habitats, but prefer open areas with short herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, along flat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are characterized by short herbs (Alchemilla spp.) and grasses, and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result of Ethiopian African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (Festuca spp., Agrostis spp.), high-altitude shrubs dominated by Helichrysum spp., and short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern parts of the range, plant communities characterized by a matrix of “guassa” tussock grasses (Festuca spp.), “cherenfi” bushes (Euryops pinifolius) and giant lobelias (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) sustain high rodent abundance and are preferred by wolves. Ericaceous moorlands (Erica and Phillipia spp.) at 3200-3600 m are of marginal value, whereas open moorlands containing patches of herbs and grasses offer relatively good habitat. Food and Feeding. Ethiopian Wolves feed almost exclusively upon diurnal rodents of the high-altitude Afro-alpine grassland community. In the Bale Mountains, diurnal rodents accounted for 96% of all prey occurrences in feces, with 87% belonging to three Bale endemic species: the Ethiopian African Mole Rat ( 300-930 g ), Blick’s Grass Rat ( Arvicanthis blicki ), and the Black-clawed Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys melanonyx ). Other prey species include the Ethiopian Vlei Rat ( Otomys typus ), Ethiopian Buff-spotted Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys flavopunctatus ), Ethiopian Highland Hare (Lepus starcki), and occasionally goslings and eggs. On occasion, wolves were observed feeding on Rock Hyrax (Procavia capensis), and young of Bush Duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), Common Reedbuck (Redunca redunca), and Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni). Sedge leaves (Carex monostachya) are occasionally ingested, probably to assist digestion or control parasites. Where the Ethiopian African Mole Ratis absent (i.e. Gaysay montane grassland in Bale and Menz), it is replaced in the wolf diet by the smaller Northeast African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes splendens). Similarly, in northern Ethiopia Arvicanthis abyssinicus and Lophuromysflavopunctatus replace their respective endemic relatives (A. blickiand L. melanonyx) from Bale. Elsewhere, O. typus , a rare prey item in Bale and Menz, was identified as the commonest prey in droppings collected in the otherfive populations.

Ethiopian Wolves live in packs of 3- 13 adults , in discrete and cohesive social units that share and defend an exclusive territory. Annual home ranges of eight packs monitored for four years averaged 6 km ? with some overlap. Home ranges in an area of lower prey biomass averaged 13- 4 km ? (n = 4). Overlap and aggressive encounters between packs were highest during the mating season. Dispersal movements are tightly constrained by the scarcity ofsuitable habitat. Males do not disperse and are recruited into multi-male philopatric packs; some females disperse at two years of age and become “floaters”, occupying narrow ranges between pack territories until a breeding vacancy becomes available. Breeding females are typically replaced after death by a resident daughter. Pack adult sex ratio is biased toward males 1-8:1, with small family groups closer to 1:1. Wolves commonly advertize and maintain their territories by scent marking territory boundaries with urine posts, scratching, feces (deposited on conspicuoussites like mounds, rocks, and bushes), and by means of vocalizations. All pack members, independent of social rank, regularly scent-mark objects along territory boundaries with raised-leg urinations and scratches. Aggressive interactions with neighboring packs are common, highly vocal, and always end with the smaller group fleeing from the larger. Vocalizations can be grouped into two categories: alarm calls, given at the scent or sight of humans, dogs, or unfamiliar wolves; and greeting calls, given at the reunion of pack members and to advertize pack size, composition, and position. Alarm calls start with a “huff” (rapid expulsion of air through mouth and nose), followed by a quick succession of highpitched yelps and barks. These sounds can also be made as contact calls, and often attract nearby pack mates. Greeting calls include a threatening growl, a high-frequency whine of submission, and intense “group yip-howls”. Lone and group howling are long-distance calls used to contact pack members, and can be heard up to 5 km away. Howling by one pack of wolves may stimulate howling in adjacent packs.

Their ability to exploit human resources also allows them to occupy urban areas. Water availability may limit distribution in some desert environments.","Opportunistic, generalist predators that eat a wide variety of food items, ranging from fruit and insects to small mammals to large ungulates and live-stock, typically consuming items in relation to availability. Livestock and wild ungulates are often consumed as carrion, but predation on large ungulates (native and domestic) does occur. Predation on neonates of native ungulates can be high during fawning. Coyotes in suburban areas are adept at exploiting human-made food resources and will readily consume refuse, pet food or other human-related items. Studies of predatory behavior show that Coyote age, habitat, and wind and snow conditions all influence their ability to capture small mammals. Coyotes hunt small mammals alone, even when pack size is large. When preying on native ungulates, cooperation among pack members may facilitate the capture of prey, but is not essential. Environmental factors are important to the success of an attack on adult ungulates, as is the presence of the alpha Coyote pair, and younger animals generally do not participate. The number of Coyotes is not as important as which individuals are involved in the attack. The outcome is also affected by the ability of the quarry to escape into water, its defensive abilities, and its nutritional state. In areas with an ungulate prey base in winter, competition with other sympatric carnivores for a carcass may be intense and there can even be competition among members of the same pack.

Coyotes may be active throughout the day, but they tend to be more active during the early morning and around sunset. Activity patterns change seasonally (e.g. during winter, when there is a change in the food base in some areas) or in response to human disturbance and persecution. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The basic social unit is the bonded alpha pair, which may breed for up to 10-12 years. Associate animals often remain in the pack and possibly inherit the pack or displace members of the breeding pair and become alphas themselves. Associates participate in territorial maintenance and pup rearing, but not to the extent of the alpha pair. Other Coyotes exist outside of the resident packs as transient or nomadic individuals. Transients travel alone over larger areas and do not breed, but will move into territories when vacancies occur. One factor that may affect Coyote sociality is prey size or prey biomass. In populations where rodents are the major prey, Coyotes tend to be in pairs or trios. In populations where Elk and deer are available, large packs of up to ten individuals may form. Coyotes are territorial, with a dominance hierarchy within each resident pack. The dominance hierarchy influences access to food resources within the pack. In captivity, pups show early development of aggressive behavior and engage in dominance fights when 19-24 days old. The process of establishing hierarchy within litters appears to last up to 4-5 months. Territoriality regulates Coyote numbers as packs space themselves across the landscape in relation to available food and habitat. Home range size varies with energetic requirements, physiographic makeup, habitat, and food distribution. Home range size is influenced by social organization, with transients using larger areas, and residents occupying distinct territories. Only packs (2-10 animals) maintain and defend territories, both by direct confrontation and indirectly with scent marking and howling. Fidelity to the home range is high and may persist for many years. Shifts in territorial boundaries may occur in response to the loss of one or both of the alpha pair. Pups, yearlings, and non-breeding adults of lower social rank may disperse from the natal site into adjacent areas or farther afield. Dispersal seems to be voluntary, as social and nutritional pressures intensify during winter when food becomes limited. Juveniles usually disperse during autumn and early winter. Pre-dispersal forays may occur. Coyotes communicate using auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile cues. Studies have identified different types of vocalizations, seasonal patterns, and the influence of social status on vocalization rates. Howling plays a role in territorial maintenance and pack spacing by advertising boundaries and signaling the presence of alpha animals that will confront intruders and defend the territory. Scent marking contributes to territory maintenance and is performed mostly by alpha individuals. Scent marking may also be an indicator of sexual condition, maturity, or synchrony.",,"Coyotes may be active throughout the day, but they tend to be more active during the early morning and around sunset.

Both males and females show annual cyclic changes in reproductive anatomy and physiology. Females are seasonally monoestrous, showing one period of estrus per year between January and March, depending on latitude. Courtship behavior begins 2-3 months before copulation. Copulation ends with a copulatory tie lasting up to 25 minutes. The percentage of females breeding each year varies with local conditions and food supply. Usually, about 60-90% of adult females and up to 70% of female yearlings producelitters. Gestation lasts approximately 63 days. Litter size averages six (range 1-9) and may be affected by population density and food availability during the previous winter. In northern latitudes, litter size changes in response to population cycles in Snowshoe Hares (Lepus americanus). Litter size has been found to increase after cold, snowy winters, when more ungulate carcasses are available to ovulating females. Coyotes may den in brush-covered slopes, steep banks, under rock ledges, thickets, and hollow logs. Dens of other animals may also be used, and may have more than one entrance and interconnecting tunnels. The same den may be used from year to year. Denning and pup rearing are the focal point of Coyote families for several months, until the pups are large and mobile. Pups are born blind and helpless in the den. Birth weight is 240-275 g . Their eyes open at about 14 days and they emerge from the den at about three weeks. The young are cared for by the parents and other associates, usually siblings from a previous year.

The taxonomic status of the Red Wolf has been debated widely. Recent genetic and morphological evidence suggests the Red Wolf is a unique taxon, and not a hybrid of Gray Wolf and Coyote, as previously suggested. Three subspecies were initially recognized: rufus (Audubon & Bachman, 1851) , gregory: (Goldman, 1937), and floridanus (Miller, 1912), of which only one, gregoryi, 1s believed to have survived. Genetic methodologies have not been applied to sub-specific designation, and current disagreement about the relatedness of wolves in eastern North America, if resolved, may alter currently accepted subspecific classification of C. rufus .","Red Wolves exist only as a reintroduced population in E North Carolina , USA .","Head-body 104-125 cm for males and 99-120- 1 cm for females, tail 33-46 cm for males and 29- 5-44 cm for females; weight 22-34- 1 kg for males and 20-1-29- 7 kg for females. Generally appears long-legged and rangy with proportionately large ears. Intermediate in size between the Coyote and the Gray Wolf. The Red Wolf's almond-shaped eyes, broad muzzle, and wide nose pad contribute to its wolf-like appearance. The muzzle tends to be very pale in color with an area of white around the lips extending up the sides of the muzzle. Coloration is typically brownish or cinnamon with gray and black shading on the back and tail. A black phase occurred historically butis probably extinct. The dental formulais13/3,C1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42.","Very little is known about Red Wolf habitat because the species’ range was severely reduced by the time scientific investigations began. Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-western Louisiana and south-eastern Texas . However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the South-east . Red wolves reintroduced into North Carolina , and their descendants, have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins, which are forest/wetland mosaics with an understory of evergreen shrubs. This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. This generalization is supported by one study in which low human density, wetland soil type , and distance from roads were the most important predictors of potential wolf habitat in North Carolina .","Mammals such as Coypu (Myocastor coypus), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), and rodents (Sigmodon hispidus, Oryzomys palustris, Ondatra zibethicus) are common in south-eastern Texas and appear to have been the primary prey of Red Wolves historically. Presently in North Carolina , White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Northern Raccoons, and rabbits are the primary prey species for the reintroduced population (86% of the diet). While it is not uncommon for Red Wolves to forage individually, there is also evidence of group hunting by pack members. Also, resource partitioning among members of a pack sometimes occurs. In one study of pack feeding, rodents were consumed more by juveniles than adults, and use of rodents diminished as the young wolves matured. Activity patterns. Mostly nocturnal with crepuscular peaks of activity. Hunting usually occurs at night or at dawn and dusk. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Red Wolves normally live in extended family units or packs, typically including a dominant breeding pair and their offspring from previous years. Dispersal of offspring tends to occur before individuals reach two years of age. Group size in the reintroduced population ranges from a single breeding pair to twelve individuals. Red Wolves are territorial, and like other canids, appear to scent-mark boundaries to exclude non-group members from their territory. Home range size ( 46-226 km ?) varies with habitat availability.",,Mostly nocturnal with crepuscular peaks of activity.

Breeding. Red Wolves typically reach sexual maturity by 22 months of age, though breeding at ten months may occur. Mating usually takes place between February and March, gestation lasting 61-63 days. Peak whelping dates occur from mid-April to mid-May, producing litters of 1-10 pups. In a given year, a dominant pair produces one litter per pack. During the denning season, pregnant females may establish several dens. Some dens are shallow surface depressions located in dense vegetation for shelter at locations where the water table is high; other dens are deep burrows, often in windrows between agricultural fields or in canal banks. Dens have also been found in the hollowed out bases of large trees. Pups are often moved from one den to another before leaving the den altogether, and den attendance by male and female yearlings and adult pack members is common.","CITES notlisted. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Extinct in the Wild by 1980, the Red Wolf was reintroduced by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987 into eastern North Carolina . The Red Wolf is now common within the reintroduction area of roughly 6000 km *. However, the species’ abundance outside this area is unknown. Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf/ Coyote hybrids is the primary threat to the species’ persistence in the wild. While hybridization with Coyotes was a factor in the Red Wolf's initial demise in the wild, it was not detected as a problem in North Carolina until approximately 1992.

Red Wolf Canis rufus French: Loup roux / German: Rotwolf / Spanish: Lobo rojo Taxonomy. Canis rufus Audubon & Bachman, 1851 , Texas , USA . The taxonomic status of the Red Wolf has been debated widely. Recent genetic and morphological evidence suggests the Red Wolf is a unique taxon, and not a hybrid of Gray Wolf and Coyote, as previously suggested. Three subspecies were initially recognized: rufus (Audubon & Bachman, 1851) , gregory: (Goldman, 1937), and floridanus (Miller, 1912), of which only one, gregoryi, 1s believed to have survived. Genetic methodologies have not been applied to sub-specific designation, and current disagreement about the relatedness of wolves in eastern North America, if resolved, may alter currently accepted subspecific classification of C. rufus . Distribution. Red Wolves exist only as a reintroduced population in E North Carolina , USA . Descriptive notes. Head-body 104-125 cm for males and 99-120- 1 cm for females, tail 33-46 cm for males and 29- 5-44 cm for females; weight 22-34- 1 kg for males and 20-1-29- 7 kg for females. Generally appears long-legged and rangy with proportionately large ears. Intermediate in size between the Coyote and the Gray Wolf. The Red Wolf's almond-shaped eyes, broad muzzle, and wide nose pad contribute to its wolf-like appearance. The muzzle tends to be very pale in color with an area of white around the lips extending up the sides of the muzzle. Coloration is typically brownish or cinnamon with gray and black shading on the back and tail. A black phase occurred historically butis probably extinct. The dental formulais13/3,C1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. Habitat. Very little is known about Red Wolf habitat because the species’ range was severely reduced by the time scientific investigations began. Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-western Louisiana and south-eastern Texas . However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the South-east . Red wolves reintroduced into North Carolina , and their descendants, have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins, which are forest/wetland mosaics with an understory of evergreen shrubs. This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. This generalization is supported by one study in which low human density, wetland soil type , and distance from roads were the most important predictors of potential wolf habitat in North Carolina . Food and Feeding. Mammals such as Coypu (Myocastor coypus), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), and rodents (Sigmodon hispidus, Oryzomys palustris, Ondatra zibethicus) are common in south-eastern Texas and appear to have been the primary prey of Red Wolves historically. Presently in North Carolina , White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Northern Raccoons, and rabbits are the primary prey species for the reintroduced population (86% of the diet). While it is not uncommon for Red Wolves to forage individually, there is also evidence of group hunting by pack members. Also, resource partitioning among members of a pack sometimes occurs. In one study of pack feeding, rodents were consumed more by juveniles than adults, and use of rodents diminished as the young wolves matured. Activity patterns. Mostly nocturnal with crepuscular peaks of activity. Hunting usually occurs at night or at dawn and dusk. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Red Wolves normally live in extended family units or packs, typically including a dominant breeding pair and their offspring from previous years. Dispersal of offspring tends to occur before individuals reach two years of age. Group size in the reintroduced population ranges from a single breeding pair to twelve individuals. Red Wolves are territorial, and like other canids, appear to scent-mark boundaries to exclude non-group members from their territory. Home range size ( 46-226 km ?) varies with habitat availability. Breeding. Red Wolves typically reach sexual maturity by 22 months of age, though breeding at ten months may occur. Mating usually takes place between February and March, gestation lasting 61-63 days. Peak whelping dates occur from mid-April to mid-May, producing litters of 1-10 pups. In a given year, a dominant pair produces one litter per pack. During the denning season, pregnant females may establish several dens. Some dens are shallow surface depressions located in dense vegetation for shelter at locations where the water table is high; other dens are deep burrows, often in windrows between agricultural fields or in canal banks. Dens have also been found in the hollowed out bases of large trees. Pups are often moved from one den to another before leaving the den altogether, and den attendance by male and female yearlings and adult pack members is common. Status and Conservation. CITES notlisted. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Extinct in the Wild by 1980, the Red Wolf was reintroduced by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987 into eastern North Carolina . The Red Wolf is now common within the reintroduction area of roughly 6000 km *. However, the species’ abundance outside this area is unknown. Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf/ Coyote hybrids is the primary threat to the species’ persistence in the wild. While hybridization with Coyotes was a factor in the Red Wolf's initial demise in the wild, it was not detected as a problem in North Carolina until approximately 1992. Indeed, the region was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes. However, during the 1990s the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area. In the absence of hybridization, recovery of the Red Wolf and subsequent removal of the species from the USA Endangered Species List is deemed possible. It is noteworthy that similar hybridization has been observed in the population of suspected Red Wolf-type wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario , Canada . If these wolves are ultimately shown to be Red Wolf-type wolves, this will enhance the conservation status of the species and nearly triple the known number of Red Wolf-type wolves surviving in the wild.

In Minas Gerais , Brazil , two radio-tagged foxes were observed most often at the interface of livestock pasture and gallery forest “vereidas” and less frequently in eucalyptus/agricultural plantations (8%).","Omnivorous: diet includes fruit, vertebrates, insects, amphibians, crustaceans, birds, and carrion. An opportunistic predator; diet at any one location varies according to availability, season, and probably social status. In areas of human disturbance, a large proportion of the diet may comprise foods such as cultivated fruits, domestic fowl, and refuse. In the Venezuelan Llanos, the percent volume of food items from the contents of 104 fox stomachs from four different locations included: small mammals (26%), fruit (24%), amphibians (13%), insects (11%); the dry season diet was predominantly small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, with insect and fruit becoming more frequent in the wet season. In one Venezuelan location, land crabs (Dilocarcinus spp.) were the most frequently occurring dietary item in the rainy season, and in the Ibera Wetlands ( Corrientes , Argentina ), aquatic birds were identified in 87% of 23 fox scats collected in the vicinity of a bird breeding colony. Vertebrates were the most frequently encountered food item (69%) of 74 prey items identified in 22 scats collected at elevations of above 2600 m in the eastern Colombian Andes, but were the least favored food item (15%) in feces collected from the lowland wooded savannahs of Marajo ( Brazil ), where cultivated and wild fruit (57%) and insects (86%) were more frequently encountered. Crab-eating Foxes hunt individually, but most commonly as pairs; 1-3 adultsized offspring may accompany them. Cooperative hunting apparently is rare. They will tolerate close proximity when foraging on concentrated, easily available food items such as turtle eggs, fruit, insects (e.g. termites), and sizeable carrion (e.g. goat carcass). The young start to hunt with the parents at about six weeks of age. Hunting strategies include spring-pouncing to capture vertebrates, ground-level lateral head movements to snatch insects, and directional maneuvers in pursuit of land crabs. The foxes in Marajo deliver a series of shoulder blows, with face up-turned, to some food items (e.g. toads, eggs) prior to comsuming them. In the same region, foxes search for and consume small stones from specific open gravel sites, presumably as a source of minerals. Foxes cache food items but do not regularly urine-mark them. They probably act as seed dispersers of a range of wild and cultivated plant species, as indicated by the presence of germinating seeds in their scats. Examples include Acacia aroma and Celtis tala (montane Chaco , Argentina ), Butia capitata ( Uruguay ), Hovenia dulcis (Iguacu National Park, Brazil ), Ficus spp. (south-eastern Brazil ), Psidium guineense, Humiria balsamifera, and Anacardium occidentale (Amazonian Brazil ). Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal and crepuscular. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Social groups comprise a breeding pair and 1-5 offspring (older than one year). Family members usually travel around their home ranges in pairs or,if offspring are present, in loosely knit family groups. Separated foxes maintain contact by long distance, high-pitched, bird-like trill vocalizations. In Marajo, Brazil , territorial breeding pairs were located less than 100 m apart on a mean 54% (n = 7) of occasions during the period of activity, whereas close proximity of breeding adults and their adultsized offspring varied from 7-2% to 93-3% between given pairings. In Marajo, Brazil adult foxes occupied stable territories of 5- 3 km ? (range 0-5-10- 4 km ?), whereas in pasture/eucalyptus habitats in Minas Gerais ( Brazil ), an adult male’s range was 2- 2 km ? In dry forest sites in Santa Cruz , Bolivia an adult female and two adult males occupied mean home ranges of 2- 2 km * (range 1-1-2- 8 km ?). In the central Venezuelan Llanos, three adult foxes and three adult fox pairs showed dry season home ranges (mean 0-7 km ?*range 0-5- 1 km ?) to be generally larger than wet season home ranges (mean 0-7 km ? range 0-3- 1 km ?). Shrinkage of fox range sizes in the wet season is thought to be in response to changes in the availability of dry habitats and/or prey density. Dispersing offspring established territories adjoining their natal range. The average distance between range centers was 2-4 km (range 1-9- 2-9 km ). After dispersal, these foxes interacted amicably with kin members both inside and outside their natal ranges. Four male foxes returned to their natal range 3-13 months after their dispersal, in two cases following the death of their mate and in one case after breeding.

The use of scat latrines located near resting sites has also been reported. Breeding. In the wild, litters are produced once per breeding year. Litters were observed in Brazil in the months ofJune to December. In the Venezuelan Llanos,litters were recorded between December and February and lactating females were seen in June. Elsewhere in Venezuela litters were observed year round (January, May, July, and October), and lactating foxes were recorded in August. On emergence from the natal den at 2-3 months, the mean littersize is 2:6 (range 2-3). It is not known whether the presence of a dominant female inhibits ovulation in subordinate females. In captivity, births have been recorded in January, February, March, June, and October, and foxes may breed twice annually at intervals of 7-8 months. Gestation period is 56 days (range 52-59 days), and neonatal weight is 120-160 g . Cub rearing is the responsibility of both breeding adults. Additional helpers have not been observed directly in the wild. However, the strong social affiliations between adults and dispersed returning offspring during subsequent breeding periods are strongly suggestive ofsibling helpers. In captivity, both sexes bring solid food (they do not regurgitate) to the young who consume solids from day 16-20. Pups first leave the den around day 28, but more regularly from day 45, at which time they develop the adult pelage. Lactation lasts for approximately 90 days. Post-weaning dependency lasts for up to five months, until sexual maturity, which occurs at approximately nine months. Offspring disperse when they are 18-24 months old. Crab-eating Foxes do not regularly excavate burrows, but rest aboveground in dense undergrowth (including when rearing pups), and also occasionally adopt abandoned burrows of other animals such as armadillos ( Dasypodidae spp.).","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Crab-eating Foxes are considered common in most range countries, and populations are probably stable. The species is currently listed as “potentially vulnerable” in the Argentine Red Data Book, but not listed as threatened in Bolivia , Brazil , and Colombia . There is little documentation for populations in Suriname , French Guiana, and peripheral areas of lowland Amazon forest. No specific protective legislation exists for this species, though hunting wildlife is officially forbidden in most range countries. Crab-eating Foxes are potentially threatened by pathogens from domestic dogs. The Crab-eating Fox is also perceived as a pest of poultry throughout much ofits range (and in Uruguay as a predator of lambs), and consequently is often shot, trapped, and poisoned indiscriminately. In some countries, pest control is limited by specific quotas (without official bounties), although the system is often ignored, abused, or not enforced. Trapping occurred extensively in dry forest regions in Bolivia before the early 1980s, when single pelts were worth US $ 30, but the species currently has little commercial value as a furbearer. Crab-eating Foxes are also often killed by vehicles on roadways in some areas.","Biben (1982, 1983) | Bisbal (1988) | Bisbal & Ojasti (1980) | Brady (1978, 1979) | Cabrera (1931, 1958) | Cordero-Rodriguez & Nassar (1999) | Courtenay (1998) | Courtenay & Maffei (2004) | Courtenay, Macdonald et al.

Bush Dogs have been observed in lowland (below 1500 m ) forested habitats, including primary and gallery forest, semi-deciduous forest, and seasonally flooded forest. Observations have also been recorded from cerrado habitat in Brazil and Paraguay and pampas (wet savannah) edge/riparian areas, and as far as 5700 m from forest habitat. Occasionally reported from secondary forest, ranchland, and fragmented cerrado ranchland.","Primarily carnivorous, Bush Dogs mainly hunt large rodents such as Lowland Pacas and agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.). Their diet often includes other small mammals (e.g. rats, Oryzomys spp. and Proechimys spp., rabbits, Sylvilagus brasiliensis, opossums, Didelphis spp. and the Nine-banded Armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus ). Other prey items include teju lizards (Tupinambis sp.), snakes, and possibly ground-nesting birds. Bush Dogs can engage in group hunting to take prey considerably larger than themselves, such as Capybaras (Hydrochoeris hydrochaeris), and rheas (Rhea americana), deer (Mazama spp.), and even South American Tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Bush Dogs hunt in packs of 2-8 animals (mean 4-5) employing a variety of cooperative hunting strategies. Prey is pursued relentlessly by the pack, even into deep water. In Bolivia the dogs hunt Mazama deer by attacking the legs until the animaltires and falls. Olfaction may play a large role when foraging. Some individuals may enter the burrow of a prey species while other pack members wait at possible escape routes. Activity patterns. Mostly diurnal; the pair and any family members spend the night in a den. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Bush Dogs are considered the most social of the small canids, reportedly living in groups ranging from 2-12 individuals, with most observed groups including 2-6 members. The ability of a pack to hunt cooperatively appears to be a primary benefit of the Bush Dog’s social organization. Estimated home range is between 4-6 and 4-7 km *. A monogamous pair-bond is likely with the offspring from multiple yearsliving with the pair. Urine-marking may be important for the formation and maintenance of pair-bonds. Bush Dogs tend to be associated with strong smell, lending evidence that urine is a particularly effective intra-specific communication medium. Males extrude the penis and move laterally, creating a spray rather than a stream, and females drag their ano-genital region over a surface or display either a forelimb handstand or a squat. The raised posture allows urine to be deposited some 150 mm higher than the spray of the male. Adult Bush Dog vocalizations have been classified as whines, repetitive whines, pulsed vocalization, screams, barks, and growls. Infants whine, grunt, growl, and bark; these vocalizations are thought to eitherelicit care or reduce aggression. The elaborate set of close-contact calls assists in communicating subtle changes in mood as well as changes in location.",,Mostly diurnal; the pair and any family members spend the night in a den.,"Bush Dogs are considered the most social of the small canids, reportedly living in groups ranging from 2-12 individuals, with most observed groups including 2-6 members.

The Bush Dog mating season is unknown, although pups have been found in the wet season. Captive females have two estrous cycles per year. Estrus is aseasonal and likely influenced by social factors. Dominant females appear to suppress the estrus of daughters. Gestation in captivity is 67 days, and meanlitter size is 3-8 (range 1-6). Lactation lasts approximately eight weeks. Males exhibit a high degree of parental care that includes food supplementation to females prior to birth and throughout nursing. Bush dogs appear to be sexually mature by one year.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Currently, the population is estimated to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals. Appears naturally rare throughoutits range, independent of human disturbance. Hunting and trade is regulated in Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , and Venezuela , and is prohibited elsewhere in the range. Perceived threats include habitat conversion and human encroachment.

The Bush Dog is a forest dweller, occurring generally near water sources, particularly small streams, and near available prey populations, especially Lowland Paca (Cuniculus paca). Bush Dogs have been observed in lowland (below 1500 m ) forested habitats, including primary and gallery forest, semi-deciduous forest, and seasonally flooded forest. Observations have also been recorded from cerrado habitat in Brazil and Paraguay and pampas (wet savannah) edge/riparian areas, and as far as 5700 m from forest habitat. Occasionally reported from secondary forest, ranchland, and fragmented cerrado ranchland. Food and Feeding. Primarily carnivorous, Bush Dogs mainly hunt large rodents such as Lowland Pacas and agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.). Their diet often includes other small mammals (e.g. rats, Oryzomys spp. and Proechimys spp., rabbits, Sylvilagus brasiliensis, opossums, Didelphis spp. and the Nine-banded Armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus ). Other prey items include teju lizards (Tupinambis sp.), snakes, and possibly ground-nesting birds. Bush Dogs can engage in group hunting to take prey considerably larger than themselves, such as Capybaras (Hydrochoeris hydrochaeris), and rheas (Rhea americana), deer (Mazama spp.), and even South American Tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Bush Dogs hunt in packs of 2-8 animals (mean 4-5) employing a variety of cooperative hunting strategies. Prey is pursued relentlessly by the pack, even into deep water. In Bolivia the dogs hunt Mazama deer by attacking the legs until the animaltires and falls. Olfaction may play a large role when foraging. Some individuals may enter the burrow of a prey species while other pack members wait at possible escape routes. Activity patterns. Mostly diurnal; the pair and any family members spend the night in a den. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Bush Dogs are considered the most social of the small canids, reportedly living in groups ranging from 2-12 individuals, with most observed groups including 2-6 members. The ability of a pack to hunt cooperatively appears to be a primary benefit of the Bush Dog’s social organization. Estimated home range is between 4-6 and 4-7 km *. A monogamous pair-bond is likely with the offspring from multiple yearsliving with the pair. Urine-marking may be important for the formation and maintenance of pair-bonds. Bush Dogs tend to be associated with strong smell, lending evidence that urine is a particularly effective intra-specific communication medium. Males extrude the penis and move laterally, creating a spray rather than a stream, and females drag their ano-genital region over a surface or display either a forelimb handstand or a squat. The raised posture allows urine to be deposited some 150 mm higher than the spray of the male. Adult Bush Dog vocalizations have been classified as whines, repetitive whines, pulsed vocalization, screams, barks, and growls. Infants whine, grunt, growl, and bark; these vocalizations are thought to eitherelicit care or reduce aggression. The elaborate set of close-contact calls assists in communicating subtle changes in mood as well as changes in location. Breeding. The Bush Dog mating season is unknown, although pups have been found in the wet season. Captive females have two estrous cycles per year. Estrus is aseasonal and likely influenced by social factors. Dominant females appear to suppress the estrus of daughters. Gestation in captivity is 67 days, and meanlitter size is 3-8 (range 1-6). Lactation lasts approximately eight weeks. Males exhibit a high degree of parental care that includes food supplementation to females prior to birth and throughout nursing. Bush dogs appear to be sexually mature by one year. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Currently, the population is estimated to number fewer than 15,000 mature individuals. Appears naturally rare throughoutits range, independent of human disturbance. Hunting and trade is regulated in Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , and Venezuela , and is prohibited elsewhere in the range. Perceived threats include habitat conversion and human encroachment. Bush dogs are occasionally killed in Bolivia and Ecuador as predators of chickens, and road kills have been documented in Brazil . Bibliography.

Numerous studies document a broadly varied diet of c. 50% plant and c. 50% animal material. The fruit Solanum lycocarpum grows throughout much of the range and is a primary food source; other important items include small mammals ( Caviidae , Muridae, Echimydae ) and armadillos ( Dasypodidae ), other fruits ( Annonaceae , Myrtaceae, Palmae , Bromeliaceae , and others), birds ( Tinamidae , Emberizidae , and others), reptiles, and arthropods. Although the frequency of plant and animal items found in fecal samples is approximately equal, the biomass of animal items is usually greater than that of plant items. Certain items, such as rodents and Solanum, are consumed year round, but diet varies with food availability. At least occasionally, Pampas Deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) are also consumed. In one study, deer occurred in 2:4% of 1673 fecal samples analyzed. Strategies for hunting animal prey include stalking with a final pounce, digging after burrowing animals, leaping into the air to capture flying birds and insects, and sprinting after fleeing deer. Approximately 21% of all hunting attempts end with the successful capture of prey, and the strategies do not differ in their success rates.

The most frequently heard vocalization is a loud roar-bark, which may occur during any time of the day or night throughout the year. Breeding. Females enter estrus once per year for approximately five days. Peak breeding season is from April to June. There are numerous published accounts of breeding behavior in captivity, but little information is available from wild populations. In captivity, the frequency of vocalizations (roar-bark) and scent marking increases during the weeks prior to mating, and the amount of time a pair spends in close proximity increases significantly during the estrous period. Courtship is characterized by frequent approaches, mutual anogenital investigation, and playful interactions. Mounting may occur frequently during estrus; successful breeding includes a copulatory tie that may last several minutes. In Emas National Park, Brazil , a breeding pair observed at night for approximately three and a half hours foraged together and vocalized frequently whenever one partner was out of sight. The male marked with urine or feces wherever the female marked. A breeding display lasting ten minutes concluded in a two-minute copulatory tie, after which the pair continued to forage together. Gestation length is approximately 65 days, the majority of births occurring from June to September, during the dry season. One female gave birth to three pups in a bed of tall marsh grass. At 45 days of age the pups had notyet left the den and weighed 2 kg (females) and 2-25 kg (males). All dens found in the wild have been above ground, sheltered by natural features such as shrub canopies, rock crevices, gullies, and dry mounds in marshy, tall-grass areas. In captivity, an analysis of 361 births indicated that parturition peaks in June (winter), and the average litter size is three (range 1-7). Birth weights average 390-456 g (n = 8). In captive animals, nursing bouts begin to decline after the first month, and weaning is complete at c. 15 weeks. Pups begin consuming solids regurgitated by the parents at about four weeks of age; regurgitation has been recorded up to seven months after birth. Females with 7-14-week-old pups have been observed hunting for continuous periods of eight hours over 3 km from their den sites and pups. Pups stay in the mother’s home range for approximately one year, when they begin to disperse. Juveniles attain sexual maturity at around the same time, but usually do not reproduce until the second year. One of the many unknown aspects of Maned Wolf behavioris the role the male plays in rearing pups. Pups have been seen accompanied by two adults , and a female with pups was seen accompanied by a male many times. In captivity, males increase pup survival rates and are frequently observed regurgitating to pups and grooming them. Nonetheless, direct confirmation of male parental care in the wild isstill lacking.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Current global population is estimated to number c. 13,000 mature individuals. Maned Wolves are protected by law in many parts of their range, but enforcement is frequently problematic. Protected in Argentina (classified as “endangered” on the Red List) and included on the list of threatened animals in Brazil . Maned Wolves exist in low densities throughout their range, although in some areas of central Brazil , they appear to be more common. The most significant threat to Maned Wolf populations 1s habitat reduction, especially for agricultural conversion. The cerrado, for example, has been reduced to about 20% ofits original area, and only 1-5% is currently protected. In addition, habitat fragmentation causes the isolation of sub-populations. Road kills represent one of the main causes of mortality of Maned Wolves in Brazil , especially for young individuals and sub-adults. Highways border many of the Conservation Units of the Brazilian cerrado, and drivers often do not respect speed limits. Reserves close to urban areas often have problems with domestic dogs, which pursue and may kill Maned Wolves and can also be an important vector of disease. Diseases may represent a significant cause of mortality in the wild, but there is very little information available on the health of wild populations. Domestic dogs also possibly compete with the Maned Wolffor food. Maned Wolves are not viewed as a serious threat to livestock, although they may occasionally be shot when caught raiding chicken pens. Hunting them is prohibited in Brazil , Paraguay , and Bolivia .","Azevedo & Gastal (1997) | Bartmann & Nordhoff (1984) | Beccaceci (1992) | Bernardes et al.

The former placement of Lycaon in its own subfamily, the Simoncyoninae, is no longer recognized, and recent molecular studies have supported the separation of this species into its own genus. The African Wild Dog has been grouped with Dhole and Bush Dog, but the morphological similarities among these species are no longer considered to indicate common ancestry. Genetic and morphological studies initially suggested the existence of separate subspecies in eastern and southern Africa. However, no geographical boundaries separated these proposed subspecies, and dogs sampled from the intermediate area showed a mixture of southern and eastern haplotypes, indicating a cline rather than distinct subspecies.

The largest populations exist in Botswana , Tanzania , and Zimbabwe , which account for approximately half of the estimated number of African Wild Dogs remaining in the wild. Other populations occur in Central African Republic , Ethiopia , Kenya , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Sudan , and Zambia . Potential small populations (less than 100 individuals) may exist in Cameroon , Chad , Senegal , and Somalia .","Head-body 84:5-138- 5 cm for males and 93-141 cm for females, tail 32-42 cm for males and 31-37 cm for females; weight 21-34-5 kg for males and 18-26-5 kg for females. Males are slightly heavier than females, and are easily recognized by the conspicuous penis sheath. A large but lightly built canid, with long, slim legs and large, rounded ears. The coloration of the pelage is distinctive but highly variable, a combination of irregular black, yellow-brown, and white blotches on the back, sides, and legs. African Wild Dogs in north-eastern Africa are predominantly black, with small white and yellow patches. Dogs in southern Africa are lighter, with a mix of brown, black, and white. Pelage coloration is unique to each animal, and can thus be used to identify individuals. Head yellow-brown with a black mask, black ears, a black line following the sagittal crest, and a white-tipped tail. Hair is generally very short on the limbs and body and longer on the neck, sometimes giving a shaggy appearance at the throat. Females have six to eight pairs of mammae. The dental formula is I 3/3, C 1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. As with Cuon and Speothos departure from the typical form of dentition within the Canidae is apparent in the lower carnassial, where the inner cusp of the talonid is missing so that instead of forming a basin, this part of the tooth forms a subsidiary blade. This is indicative of a highly carnivorous diet.","Wild Dogs occupy a range of habitats including short-grass plains, semi-desert, bushy savannahs, and upland forest. Early studies in Tanzania’s Serengeti led to a belief that Wild Dogs were primarily an open-plains species, but they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g. central Tanzania , western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana ). Several relict populations also occupy dense upland forest (e.g. Harenna Forest, Ethiopia ; Ngare Ndare Forest, Kenya ). Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert, although they appear unable to expand into the southern Kalahari or into montane habitats; they occur in some lowland forest areas. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than the loss of a specific habitat type .","Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. In most areas their principal prey are Impala, Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), Thomson's Gazelle, and Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). They will give chase to larger species, such as Common Eland (7Tragelaphus oryx) and African Buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but rarely kill these species. Warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), dik-diks (Madoqua spp.), Steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), and duikers (Cephalophini) are important prey items in some areas. African Wild Dogs also take small prey opportunistically, such as hares, lizards, and bird eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet. African Wild Dogs live and hunt in packs. Hunts appear to be highly coordinated and are often preceded by a “social rally”. During chases, African Wild Dogs may run at speeds of up to 60 km /h, and are specially adapted to cope with the heat stress that this involves. After one dog has made the first grab of an antelope or other prey species, other pack members join and help drag the quarry to the ground. In some hunts, one pack member may restrain the head of the prey by biting its nose and holding on while others make the kill. Individuals may also chase and bring down prey alone. Hunting success is high in comparison with other large carnivore species (e.g. in the Serengeti, 70% of 133 African Wild Dog hunts ended in a kill). Social hunting gives each pack member a higher foraging success rate (measured as kg killed per km chased) relative to hunting alone. African Wild Dogs very rarely scavenge. Activity patterns. African Wild Dogs are mainly crepuscular and hunt during the early morning and early evening hours. They may also hunt occasionally at night when moonlight is ample. Activity appears to be limited by ambient temperature and availability of light. Movements, Home range and Social organization. African Wild Dogs are intensely social, living in close association with each other in a pack. Pack size varies from a pair to as many as 30 adults and yearlings, although typically packs include between four and nine adults along with yearlings and pups. Packs form when small same-sex subgroups (usually littermates) leave their natal groups and join subgroups of the opposite sex. Occasionally, new packs form by fission from larger groups, males and females emigrating together. Because African Wild Dogs are obligate social breeders, the pack, rather than the individual, should be considered the basic unit within the population. African Wild Dogs have large home ranges, for example 620 to 2460 km * in Serengeti, which are much larger than would be expected on the basis of their body size. Ranges in other areas, however, are typically between 400 and 600 km *. Ranges are defended infrequently but aggressively against neighboring packs, and African Wild Dogs may thus be considered territorial, especially as such areas are scent-marked. During the breeding season, when they are feeding young pups at a den, packs are confined to relatively small core areas ( 50-200 km ?®), but outside the denning period they range widely. As a result, the large home ranges of this species translate into low population densities. African Wild Dogs dispersing from their natal packs may travel distances exceeding hundreds of kilometers. African Wild Dogs have a complex communication system that includes unique vocalizations.",,African Wild Dogs are mainly crepuscular and hunt during the early morning and early evening hours. They may also hunt occasionally at night when moonlight is ample. Activity appears to be limited by ambient temperature and availability of light.,"African Wild Dogs are intensely social, living in close association with each other in a pack. Pack size varies from a pair to as many as 30 adults and yearlings, although typically packs include between four and nine adults along with yearlings and pups. Packs form when small same-sex subgroups (usually littermates) leave their natal groups and join subgroups of the opposite sex. Occasionally, new packs form by fission from larger groups, males and females emigrating together.

African Wild Dogs have a complex communication system that includes unique vocalizations. Breeding. Fach pack includes a dominant pair that breeds each year. Subordinate females may breed on some occasions, but their pups rarely survive. Parental care involves all pack members. Such alloparental care is vital: small packs (less than four members) rarely manage to raise any pups. Cooperative care may even extend to caring for adopted pups. Whelping occurs once per year, and gestation lasts 71-73 days. Wild Dogs have large litters, averaging 10-11 pups, butlitters as large as 21 have been recorded. Pup sex ratios are male-biased in some populations. The pups each weigh approximately 300-350 g and are born in an underground den, which they use for the first three months of life. The dens are often those of Aardvarks, sometimes modified by warthogs or Spotted Hyenas. The mother is confined to the den during early lactation, and is reliant on other pack members to provision her during this time. Pack members feed the mother and pups (from four weeks of age) by regurgitating solid pieces of meat. Some also “babysit” the pups and chase predators off while the remainder of the pack is away hunting. Pups are generally fully weaned by eight weeks but continue to use a den for refuge until 12-16 weeks of age. They reach sexual maturity in their second year of life, but social suppression can mean that few animals breed at this age, or indeed at any age.","CITES not listed. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Estimated population size is 3000 to 5500 remaining in the wild. Legally protected across much ofits range. However, this protection is rarely enforced and Wild Dogs are extinct in several countries despite stringent legal measures. African Wild Dogs survive mainly in small isolated populations in reserves and protected areas, which makes them more prone to extinction and less likely to recover from potentially catastrophic events (i.e. outbreaks of epidemic disease). More than half of the mortality of adults is caused directly by human activities, even in some of the largest and best protected areas. African Wild dogs using protected areas often range outside borders and into areas used by people. Here they encounter a myriad of threats including high-speed vehicles, guns, snares, and poisoning, as well as domestic dogs, which can be reservoirs of potentially lethal diseases.

Canine distemper may also affect African Wild Dog populations, although exposure may not always be fatal. The status of African Wild Dogs in several areas, including West and Central Africa, remains largely unknown.","Creel & Creel (1995, 2002) | Creel, Creel, Mills & Monfort (1997) | Creel, Creel, Munson et al.

African Wild Dog Lycaon pictus French: Lycaon / German: Afrikanischer Wildhund / Spanish: Licadn Other common names: Painted Hunting Dog Taxonomy. Hyaena picta Temminck, 1820, coastal Mozambique . The former placement of Lycaon in its own subfamily, the Simoncyoninae, is no longer recognized, and recent molecular studies have supported the separation of this species into its own genus. The African Wild Dog has been grouped with Dhole and Bush Dog, but the morphological similarities among these species are no longer considered to indicate common ancestry. Genetic and morphological studies initially suggested the existence of separate subspecies in eastern and southern Africa. However, no geographical boundaries separated these proposed subspecies, and dogs sampled from the intermediate area showed a mixture of southern and eastern haplotypes, indicating a cline rather than distinct subspecies. On following pages: 10. Maned Wolf ( Chrysocyon brachyurus ); 11. Bush Dog ( Speothos venaticus ), 12. Crab-eating Fox ( Cerdocyon thous ); 13. Short-eared Dog ( Atelocynus microtis ). Distribution. Sub-Saharan Africa; virtually eradicated from W Africa, and greatly reduced in C and NE Africa. The largest populations exist in Botswana , Tanzania , and Zimbabwe , which account for approximately half of the estimated number of African Wild Dogs remaining in the wild. Other populations occur in Central African Republic , Ethiopia , Kenya , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Sudan , and Zambia . Potential small populations (less than 100 individuals) may exist in Cameroon , Chad , Senegal , and Somalia . Descriptive notes. Head-body 84:5-138- 5 cm for males and 93-141 cm for females, tail 32-42 cm for males and 31-37 cm for females; weight 21-34-5 kg for males and 18-26-5 kg for females. Males are slightly heavier than females, and are easily recognized by the conspicuous penis sheath. A large but lightly built canid, with long, slim legs and large, rounded ears. The coloration of the pelage is distinctive but highly variable, a combination of irregular black, yellow-brown, and white blotches on the back, sides, and legs. African Wild Dogs in north-eastern Africa are predominantly black, with small white and yellow patches. Dogs in southern Africa are lighter, with a mix of brown, black, and white. Pelage coloration is unique to each animal, and can thus be used to identify individuals. Head yellow-brown with a black mask, black ears, a black line following the sagittal crest, and a white-tipped tail. Hair is generally very short on the limbs and body and longer on the neck, sometimes giving a shaggy appearance at the throat. Females have six to eight pairs of mammae. The dental formula is I 3/3, C 1/1,PM 4/4, M 2/3 = 42. As with Cuon and Speothos departure from the typical form of dentition within the Canidae is apparent in the lower carnassial, where the inner cusp of the talonid is missing so that instead of forming a basin, this part of the tooth forms a subsidiary blade. This is indicative of a highly carnivorous diet. Habitat. Wild Dogs occupy a range of habitats including short-grass plains, semi-desert, bushy savannahs, and upland forest. Early studies in Tanzania’s Serengeti led to a belief that Wild Dogs were primarily an open-plains species, but they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g. central Tanzania , western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana ). Several relict populations also occupy dense upland forest (e.g. Harenna Forest, Ethiopia ; Ngare Ndare Forest, Kenya ). Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert, although they appear unable to expand into the southern Kalahari or into montane habitats; they occur in some lowland forest areas. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than the loss of a specific habitat type . Food and Feeding. Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. In most areas their principal prey are Impala, Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), Thomson's Gazelle, and Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). They will give chase to larger species, such as Common Eland (7Tragelaphus oryx) and African Buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but rarely kill these species. Warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), dik-diks (Madoqua spp.), Steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), and duikers (Cephalophini) are important prey items in some areas. African Wild Dogs also take small prey opportunistically, such as hares, lizards, and bird eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet. African Wild Dogs live and hunt in packs. Hunts appear to be highly coordinated and are often preceded by a “social rally”. During chases, African Wild Dogs may run at speeds of up to 60 km /h, and are specially adapted to cope with the heat stress that this involves. After one dog has made the first grab of an antelope or other prey species, other pack members join and help drag the quarry to the ground. In some hunts, one pack member may restrain the head of the prey by biting its nose and holding on while others make the kill. Individuals may also chase and bring down prey alone. Hunting success is high in comparison with other large carnivore species (e.g. in the Serengeti, 70% of 133 African Wild Dog hunts ended in a kill). Social hunting gives each pack member a higher foraging success rate (measured as kg killed per km chased) relative to hunting alone. African Wild Dogs very rarely scavenge. Activity patterns. African Wild Dogs are mainly crepuscular and hunt during the early morning and early evening hours. They may also hunt occasionally at night when moonlight is ample. Activity appears to be limited by ambient temperature and availability of light. Movements, Home range and Social organization. African Wild Dogs are intensely social, living in close association with each other in a pack. Pack size varies from a pair to as many as 30 adults and yearlings, although typically packs include between four and nine adults along with yearlings and pups.

Large canids, usually with a reddish or brown coat and a darker, bushy tail (sometimes with a white tip). Sexual dimorphism is not very distinct. Ears triangular, about half the length of the face, with rounded tips. The pinnae are usually whitish-fawn on the inside and reddish-brown on the outside. The muzzle is brown, relatively short, and slightly convex in profile. Nose black and eyes slightly hooded;irises are amber. The dorsal and lateral pelage is red to brown and the foreneck, chest, and undersides are often whitish or pale ginger colored. In the south and south-west of the Dhole’s range, their fur is shorter and rusty-red colored. In the north and north-east, the fur is longer, brownish-red, or yellowish-brown. The legs are notably shorter in some alpine regions and the coat is a yellowish-gray color in Himalayan regions. In Thailand , the coat is more uniformly brown, lacking the paler throat and chest. The toes are red, brown, and/or white; the hairless foretoe pads (on all feet) are joined at the base (near the main pad) unlike most domestic dogs. Dentition is unique within the Canidae , having one fewer lower molar teeth (13/3, C 1/1, PM 4/4, M 2/2 = 40), with the heel of the lower carnassial M, crested and with a single cusp (all other canids within the range of Dhole have two cusps). There are usually six or seven pairs of mammae.","Dholes are found in a wide variety of vegetation types , including primary, secondary, and degraded forms of tropical dry and moist deciduous forest; evergreen and semi-evergreen forests; dry thorn forests; grassland—scrub—forest mosaics; and alpine steppe (above 3000 m ). They are not recorded from desert regions. In India , tropical dry and moist deciduous forest may represent optimal habitats, based on the regions thought to hold the largest Dhole populations. Ungulate biomass, particularly that of cervid species, is highest in these vegetation types when compared to others in the same region. Important factors that may influence habitat selection include the availability of medium to large ungulate prey species, water, the presence of other large carnivore species, human population levels, and suitability of breeding sites (i.e. in terms of proximity to water, presence of suitable boulder structures, and sufficient prey).","Diet includes beetles, rodents, birds, and occasionally grass and other plants like many other canids. However, Dholes hunt mainly vertebrate prey, with a preference for medium to large ungulates. They are also known to scavenge and occasionally have been observed eating carrion (e.g. Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) and Gaur (Bos frontalis) carcasses). It has been suggested that such scavenging only occurs during periods of prey scarcity, particularly during the dry season. Grass is ingested, but may serve an anti-helminthic function rather than a nutritional one. Dholes are communal hunters, occasionally forming packs of over 30 animals, but are more often found in hunting groups of fewer than ten animals. Depending on prey availability, Dholes may also hunt alone or in pairs, taking smaller prey such as deer fawns or hares. During hunts, some Dholes may lie in ambush while others drive prey towards them. Dholes often drive deer into water, where they swim out to surround and capture them. It is common for certain individuals to take particular roles in the hunt, such as leading the chase or taking the first grab at the prey. Activity patterns. Primarily a crepuscular forager, but can hunt at any time of the day or night. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Dholes usually live in packs of 5-10 individuals, but groups of as many as 25 (including juveniles) have been recorded on a regular basis. Their ability to regurgitate small quantities of meat at will and thus transport food to pack-mates and neonates facilitates communal breeding, providing food for the pups, the mother, and other adult helpers that remain at the natal den. Group size and composition may vary under different environmental conditions, but most of the current data are from India . Packs have been reported to contain significantly more males than females, perhaps a reflection of female-biased dispersal. Pack members regularly play together, engaging in mock-fights, rolling, and allogrooming. Social rank is established by pushing and holding, but rarely by aggressive biting. Groups have a strong hierarchical structure, with a dominant male and female who are the main breeders. Pack members over-mark each other’s feces and urine on latrines throughout the group’s range. The ranges of neighboring packs often exhibit little overlap, though interactions between groups occur and can be either friendly or hostile. In India , reported home range size ranged from 40 to 83 km ®. In Thailand , two radio-collared adult male Dholes occupied home range sizes of 12 km * and 49-5 km ?. Dholes have a broad and unusual vocal repertoire that includes whines, mews, squeaks, growls, growl-barks, chattering calls, and screams. This large range of alarm calls may have evolved to alert pack members to danger from predators (e.g. Leopard, Tiger, Humans), and could serve to intimidate adversaries. A repetitive whistle-like contact call may allow dispersed pack members to identify one another and to regroup. Maintaining group cohesion in this way is likely to be highly adaptive in areas with other large predators.",,"Primarily a crepuscular forager, but can hunt at any time of the day or night.","Dholes usually live in packs of 5-10 individuals, but groups of as many as 25 (including juveniles) have been recorded on a regular basis.

Maintaining group cohesion in this way is likely to be highly adaptive in areas with other large predators. Breeding. Dholes give birth once a year and have a gestation period of about nine weeks. Mating periods vary in different locations, occurring between November and April (dry season) in India , and January to May (end of the wet season) in East Java. Females are seasonally polyestrous with a cycle of 4-6 weeks. The dominant pair engages in vigorous play and marking, culminating in a copulatory tie. Usually only the dominant female breeds, but exceptions have been noted. Subordinate males sometimes show sexual interest in the alpha female and may contribute to the paternity of the litter. Litter sizes vary dramatically, even within the same pack in different years. The largest litter size recorded is twelve, with only one lactating female in the group. In captivity, newborn pups can weigh 200-350 g , although by the age of ten days their body weight can double, and they have a total body length of about 340 mm . Pups suckle from the mother until they are about three weeks old, when they start to receive regurgitated meat from other pack members. Weaning occurs by about 6-7 weeks, although in captivity this can happen as late as 8-9 weeks. All adults take part in guarding, feeding, grooming, and playing with the pups. By about three months, the pups accompany the adults on hunts; however, the pack may not be fully mobile until about eight months. Dholes reach adult size by about 15 months. In captivity, Dholes of both sexes can reproduce at two years of age. Den types range from earthen burrows to rocky caverns.","CITES Appendix II. Listed as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Latest estimates state that fewer than 2500 mature individuals remain in the wild. Current wildlife decrees in Cambodia give the Dhole protection from all hunting. A new forestry law is under preparation, and a proposalto list the species for full protection is under discussion. India’s 1972 Wildlife Act affords legal protection, specifying that permission is required to kill any individual unless in self-defense or if an individual is a man-killer. The creation of Project Tiger Reserves in India has provided some protection for Dhole populations. In the former Soviet Union, Dholes received the status of “protected animal” in 1974; however, the poisoning and shooting of Gray Wolves may inadvertently affect any remnant Dhole populations. The Dhole is legally protected in Vietnam . Knowledge of Dhole abundance is limited to estimates of the number of packs within a few protected areas in southern and central India , where Dholes are generally thought to be abundant. Abundance is relatively lower in West Bengal , Assam , and Arunachal Pradesh . In the rest of north-eastern India , Dholes are currently extinct or close to extinction. No remotely comparable information on density is available for any part of South-east Asia, and there are no empirical data on trends in this region. Threats include depletion of prey base, habitat loss and transformation, persecution by cattle grazers, and disease.","Clutton-Brock et al.

It has been suggested that such scavenging only occurs during periods of prey scarcity, particularly during the dry season. Grass is ingested, but may serve an anti-helminthic function rather than a nutritional one. Dholes are communal hunters, occasionally forming packs of over 30 animals, but are more often found in hunting groups of fewer than ten animals. Depending on prey availability, Dholes may also hunt alone or in pairs, taking smaller prey such as deer fawns or hares. During hunts, some Dholes may lie in ambush while others drive prey towards them. Dholes often drive deer into water, where they swim out to surround and capture them. It is common for certain individuals to take particular roles in the hunt, such as leading the chase or taking the first grab at the prey. Activity patterns. Primarily a crepuscular forager, but can hunt at any time of the day or night. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Dholes usually live in packs of 5-10 individuals, but groups of as many as 25 (including juveniles) have been recorded on a regular basis. Their ability to regurgitate small quantities of meat at will and thus transport food to pack-mates and neonates facilitates communal breeding, providing food for the pups, the mother, and other adult helpers that remain at the natal den. Group size and composition may vary under different environmental conditions, but most of the current data are from India . Packs have been reported to contain significantly more males than females, perhaps a reflection of female-biased dispersal. Pack members regularly play together, engaging in mock-fights, rolling, and allogrooming. Social rank is established by pushing and holding, but rarely by aggressive biting. Groups have a strong hierarchical structure, with a dominant male and female who are the main breeders. Pack members over-mark each other’s feces and urine on latrines throughout the group’s range. The ranges of neighboring packs often exhibit little overlap, though interactions between groups occur and can be either friendly or hostile. In India , reported home range size ranged from 40 to 83 km ®. In Thailand , two radio-collared adult male Dholes occupied home range sizes of 12 km * and 49-5 km ?. Dholes have a broad and unusual vocal repertoire that includes whines, mews, squeaks, growls, growl-barks, chattering calls, and screams. This large range of alarm calls may have evolved to alert pack members to danger from predators (e.g. Leopard, Tiger, Humans), and could serve to intimidate adversaries. A repetitive whistle-like contact call may allow dispersed pack members to identify one another and to regroup. Maintaining group cohesion in this way is likely to be highly adaptive in areas with other large predators. Breeding. Dholes give birth once a year and have a gestation period of about nine weeks. Mating periods vary in different locations, occurring between November and April (dry season) in India , and January to May (end of the wet season) in East Java. Females are seasonally polyestrous with a cycle of 4-6 weeks. The dominant pair engages in vigorous play and marking, culminating in a copulatory tie. Usually only the dominant female breeds, but exceptions have been noted. Subordinate males sometimes show sexual interest in the alpha female and may contribute to the paternity of the litter. Litter sizes vary dramatically, even within the same pack in different years. The largest litter size recorded is twelve, with only one lactating female in the group. In captivity, newborn pups can weigh 200-350 g , although by the age of ten days their body weight can double, and they have a total body length of about 340 mm . Pups suckle from the mother until they are about three weeks old, when they start to receive regurgitated meat from other pack members. Weaning occurs by about 6-7 weeks, although in captivity this can happen as late as 8-9 weeks. All adults take part in guarding, feeding, grooming, and playing with the pups. By about three months, the pups accompany the adults on hunts; however, the pack may not be fully mobile until about eight months. Dholes reach adult size by about 15 months. In captivity, Dholes of both sexes can reproduce at two years of age. Den types range from earthen burrows to rocky caverns. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Listed as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Latest estimates state that fewer than 2500 mature individuals remain in the wild. Current wildlife decrees in Cambodia give the Dhole protection from all hunting. A new forestry law is under preparation, and a proposalto list the species for full protection is under discussion. India’s 1972 Wildlife Act affords legal protection, specifying that permission is required to kill any individual unless in self-defense or if an individual is a man-killer. The creation of Project Tiger Reserves in India has provided some protection for Dhole populations. In the former Soviet Union, Dholes received the status of “protected animal” in 1974; however, the poisoning and shooting of Gray Wolves may inadvertently affect any remnant Dhole populations. The Dhole is legally protected in Vietnam . Knowledge of Dhole abundance is limited to estimates of the number of packs within a few protected areas in southern and central India , where Dholes are generally thought to be abundant. Abundance is relatively lower in West Bengal , Assam , and Arunachal Pradesh . In the rest of north-eastern India , Dholes are currently extinct or close to extinction. No remotely comparable information on density is available for any part of South-east Asia, and there are no empirical data on trends in this region. Threats include depletion of prey base, habitat loss and transformation, persecution by cattle grazers, and disease. Bibliography. Clutton-Brock et al.

Males are slightly larger and heavier than females. Somewhat foxlike in appearance, with a long, pointed muzzle. Diagnostic features include the dark saddle, black bushy tail and reddish flanks and limbs. The ears are large, erect, pointed, and constantly mobile. The overall body color is rufous brown, most intense on the ears, rump, and flanks. A black stripe midway up each flank slopes obliquely from behind the shoulder to the top of the rump; the dark saddle is broadest at the shoulders and tapers to a narrow point at the base of the tail. Anterior to this stripe, just behind the shoulder,is a small vertical stripe, diffuse in some individuals. Above the side markings, the back is marbled black and white giving an overall silver appearance in mature animals. Juveniles and sub-adults have similar markings, but these are drabber and only gain their full intensity at around two years of age. In the drier west and Namib coast in southern Africa the winter coat is a deep reddish brown (especially in males). The bushy tail is dark brown to black with a distinctive black sub-caudal marking. The markings, especially the side and shoulder stripes, are unique and can be used to identifiy individuals.

Upper canines long, curved, and pointed, with a sharp ridge on their posterior faces.","Black-backed Jackals are found in a wide variety of habitats including arid coastal desert, montane grassland, arid savannah and scrubland, open savannah, woodland savannah mosaics, and farmland. In general they show a preference for open habitats, tending to avoid dense vegetation. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , they are recorded from sea level to more than 3000 m in the Drakensberg Mountains, and in localities receiving more than 2000 mm of rainfall. Where more than one jackal species occurs in sympatry the selection of habitat is partitioned. Black-backed Jackals preferentially use either open grassland (when sympatric with Side-striped Jackal) or wooded savannah (when sympatric with Golden and Side-striped Jackals). In western Zimbabwe , habitat partitioning was mediated by aggressive encounters in which Blackbacked Jackals displaced Side-striped Jackals from grassland habitats.","Generalist feeders. Diet varies according to food availability. When the jackals occur in sympatry with other carnivores using the same prey base, food resources are partitioned. Dietary items typically include small- to medium-sized mammals (e.g. murids, spring hares, young ungulates), reptiles, birds and bird eggs, carrion, and human refuse, as well as invertebrates and plants. In coastal areas, Black-backed Jackals will eat beached marine mammals, seals, fish, and mussels. Invertebrates such as termites and insects are also commonly eaten. Pairs and small groups are often seen foraging together. Groups of between eight and ten aggregate at large carcasses of herbivores, and more than 80 have been recorded at seal colonies on the Namib Desert coast. Such aggregations are accompanied by aggressive behavior between territorial individuals. However, in the south-western Kalahari, where antelope carcasses are uncommon, groups of up to 15 pairs can feed in succession without much overt aggression. Matedjackal pairs will often cooperate in the capture of prey, resulting in a higher success rate. In Botswana , they occasionally form “packs” in order to hunt adult Impala (Aepyceros melampus), and there are also records of their taking adult antelope. On the Namib Desert coast they patrol beaches for beached marine refuse and move along sheltered paths between food-rich patches; the tops of coastal hummocks are used as feeding sites. In this environment, they frequently follow Brown Hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea), from a distance in the hope of securing the odd food item. Their large, mobile ears are used to locate invertebrate and small mammalian prey, which are then captured with a leap followed by an accurate pounce, in a similar manner to Red Foxes. Activity patterns. Mostly nocturnal, but activity periods may extend well into daylight hours in areas where they are free from persecution. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The monogamous mated pair, which appears to be a life-long association in most cases, is the basis of social structure, and if one member of a pair dies the other often will lose its territory. Blackbacked Jackals are territorial and use feces and urine to demarcate their territorial boundaries. Territories are spatially and temporally relatively stable, and intruders are aggressively expelled by territory holders. Water sources are shared with intruders, but the intruders perform submissive behaviorto territory holders, even to their pups. Density and group size is dependent on food biomass and dispersion. In South Africa , home range size averaged 18-2 km ® (n = 14). In the more arid south-western Kalahari, adult ranges varied from 2:6-5-2 km ? (n = 7) and mean sub-adult ranges were 6-3 km ? (n = 4). In Zimbabwe , home ranges were largest in the cold, dry season (c. 1:0-1-3 km ?*) and smaller in the hot dry season (c. 0-3-0-6 km ?), while in the Rift Valley in Kenya , home ranges varied from 0-7-3-5 km ®*. Home ranges are universally defended and mutually exclusive for pairs, with the exception of a population on the Namibian coast for which average home range size varied from 7-1-24-9 km * (n = 4). A high-pitched, whining howl is used to communicate with group members and is often used to call the group together in the early evening; this may also function in territorial advertisement. Howling often stimulates the same behavior in adjacent territories or in nearby individuals. A three- to five-syllable alarm call, consisting of an explosive yelp followed by a series of shorter high-pitched yelps, is used when disturbed and may be frantic and prolonged when the jackals are mobbing a Leopard (Panthera pardus). A low-pitched, gruff bark is used to warn pups of intruders near the den, and whines are used to call to pups. Also noted is use of a “clattering distress call” and a loud yelp when alarmed. Interestingly, Black-backed Jackals are much less vocal where they occur alongside the Golden Jackal, which is the only jackal species heard to howl in East Africa.",,"Mostly nocturnal, but activity periods may extend well into daylight hours in areas where they are free from persecution.","The monogamous mated pair, which appears to be a life-long association in most cases, is the basis of social structure, and if one member of a pair dies the other often will lose its territory.

Interestingly, Black-backed Jackals are much less vocal where they occur alongside the Golden Jackal, which is the only jackal species heard to howl in East Africa. Breeding. Mating is accompanied by increased vocalization and territoriality in both sexes. Dominant individuals within a territory constantly harass same-sex subordinates to prevent them from mating. In southern Africa mating generally occurs from late May to August, and following a gestation period of about 60 days, births occur from around July to October. It has been suggested that summerbirths are timed to coincide with the reproductive season of important rodent prey, and winter births with an increase in the availability of ungulate carcasses at the end of winter. Littersize is typically between one and six, and pups are born in modified termitaria or other convenient burrows, often with multiple entrances. The same den sites may be used from year to year. Pups first emerge from the den at three weeks, are weaned at 8-9 weeks, and are completely independent of the den at 14 weeks. Alloparental care is well documented and consists of feeding pups by regurgitation and guarding them when the parents are foraging. One “helper” may increase the average numberof pups surviving per mated pair from one to three, and two such “helpers” further increase survival to four pups. Pups reach sexual maturity at about eleven months, and even at this early age they can disperse at distances of more than 100 km .","CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. No legal protection outside protected areas. Regional estimates of abundance are not available. However, Black-backed Jackals are generally widespread, and in Namibia and South Africa they are common in protected areas where suitable habitat occurs. Also occur in many livestock-producing areas, where they are considered vermin; however, despite strenuous control measures in many farming areas of southern Africa, this species is still relatively abundant. Snaring and road accidents may be the commonest cause of jackal mortality in areas of high human density. Black-backed Jackals are persecuted as livestock killers and as carriers of rabies. Population control efforts appear largely ineffective and probably only succeed in producing a temporary reduction in local numbers.","Avery et al.

Usually feeds on the most nutritious bamboospecies in its habitat. Also eats roots, lichens, small vertebrates, birds eggs, insects and grubs. Activity patterns. Captive animals are nocturnal and crepuscular, and exhibit a polyphasic activity pattern throughout the night. In the wild, the Red Panda was thought to be most active at dawn, dusk, and at night, but several recent studies have consistently shown it is more active in the daytime than at night. In Wolong Nature Reserve, China , a subadult female, a female, and a male were reported to be active 36:5%, 49%, and 45% of the time, respectively. In Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve, bordering the former reserve on the north, six radio-collared Red Pandas had an average dailyactivity rate of 48-6%, with two peaks from 7:00 h to 10:00 h and from 17:00 h to 18:00 h.

Eastern Spotted Skunks are smaller than Striped Skunks and more weasel-like in body shape. The pelage of Eastern Spotted Skunks is black with a complex striping pattern of six stripes; the stripes can be interrupted, giving a somewhat spotted appearance. There are usually two white spots on the rump, as well as a white spot between the eyes. The dorsal stripes run down the vertebral column from the head toward the tail. Two stripes run below the dorsal stripes over the shoulder and continue across the ears, forming a small white spot in front of the ears. A third set ofstripes continues from the front feet past the end of the shoulder stripes. Locomotion in Eastern Spotted Skunksis plantigrade and these skunks run with their bodies low to the ground. While walking more slowly and cautiously, they will extend their limbs and raise their heads to get higher off the ground. Spotted skunks have five toes on each foot. They are not such efficient diggers as Conepatus or Mephitis , but are much more agile and able to climb. The dental formula for this species is 13/3, C1/1,P 3/3, M 1/2, totaling 34 teeth. The P? is always small and may be absent.","These skunks are rarely found in the open, preferring either forested areas or habitats containing significant vegetative cover. In the Plains States, these skunks inhabit riparian woodlands and areas of vegetation along fences. They also are found in brushy and rocky habitats, but avoid wetlands. They have been observed on sandy soils and beaches in Florida . Eastern Spotted Skunks seem to prefer habitat with extensive vegetative cover, as this cover provides protection from various predators. They den in protected, dark, dry holes including natural crevices in trees, and will den off the ground to an elevation of seven meters in hollow trees. They dig their own burrows, or den in holes previously occupied by other animals, in talus slopes, haystacks, under houses or rocks, and in the walls of houses or barns. They prefer warm holes in the winter and cool dens in the summer, and will change den sites to accommodate these needs.","Eastern Spotted Skunks forage primarily at night. They are secretive and not often seen. These skunks are exceptional mousers and do farmers a great service when they forage around barns and buildings. They are omnivores, but tend to be more carnivorous than Mephitis or Conepatus . The diet consists mainly of insects, small mammals, birds, and birds’ eggs. Like a center hiking an American football, the skunk uses its front paws to throw an egg through its back legs in order to crack the shell. These skunks also will eat fruits and vegetables in the summer and fall when they are available. Activity patterns. They are generally nocturnal. They usually avoid moonlit nights. On nights when the moon is not out they normally have two periods of activity. They will come out soon after sunset and again before sunrise. They will be active throughout the night as well. Eastern Spotted Skunks have been observed during the day on rare occasions. Spotted skunks are quite agile and are capable of climbing. This agility also can be observed in their threat behavior as they are able to perform front handstands. When faced with a potential predator, the skunk rushes forward, then stands on its forepaws with its hind end elevated off the ground. This behavior has been reported to last for up to eight minutes in short, 2-5 second bursts of handstanding. However, a young, captive animal from a wildlife rehabilitation effort was observed crouching under a couch on all fours until a domestic cat came into the room. The skunk rushed out from under the couch toward the cat. As soon as its tail cleared the cushion it went into a handstand/run. The cat began to trot away. The skunk followed on its frontfeet, bouncing around a table, about 1-5 m and then jumped up on a stand approximately 6 cm off the ground, ran along the stand, hopped off the end and continued to chase the cat to the other end of the room. The cat finally ran off and the skunk dropped down on all fours and went back under the couch. Spotted skunks have been reported to spray from the hand-stand position, but they usually drop down and face the predator with both ends in a “U” shape. The handstand is usuallyjust a threat behavior used to drive off the predator. Movements, Home range and Social organization. These skunks usually den alone, but in cold winter months several skunks may bed down together. They usually use more than one den site within their home range. Eastern Spotted Skunks move from den to den and more than one individual has been captured at the same den site in capture-recapture studies. They may also share dens, but with only one animal using the den at a time. Captive male animals have been reported to be aggressive toward one another to the point of one animal killing the other. Females tended not to engage in fatal fights, but remained defensive while in the same cage. Young animals will wrestle and screech at one another, but will also sleep together. Young animals will usually separate before reaching full adulthood. Spotted skunks have a patchy distribution throughout their range. Where they occur they can be found at a density of about nine animals per km? to about 20 and even 40 per km”. Eastern Spotted Skunks tend to move greater distances in the spring than in the summer and fall. Home ranges can be up to 4359 ha.",,"They are generally nocturnal. They usually avoid moonlit nights.

Eastern Spotted Skunks tend to move greater distances in the spring than in the summer and fall. Home ranges can be up to 4359 ha. Breeding. Reproduction in the Eastern Spotted Skunk is different from that in the Western Spotted Skunk. The main breeding season for this species is during March and April, although some individuals may breed again in July, August, or September to produce a second litter. Gestation is estimated to be from 50 to 65 days, with only a two-week period of delayed implantation. First-season litters are produced in late May and early June. Litter size averages five but ranges from 2-9 kits. Young are born naked or with sparse, fine, black and white pelage. The claws are well- developed at birth. The eyes and ears open at about 30 days and teeth become visible at 32 days. They can make squealing vocalizations at an early age. The young are weaned after about two months.","Notlisted in CITES. Classified as Least Concern in The [UCN Red List. However, there has been concern over the lack of observations of this species throughout its range in the last few decades. Population densities of Eastern Spotted Skunks were believed to be low when settlers first arrived on the Great Plains. When small farm operations flourished there prior to the 1920s, spotted skunks became more numerous as farm buildings provided shelter as well as a supply of mice and rats. When the small farms gave way to larger operations, the density of spotted skunks became lower. Today, the Eastern Spotted Skunk is considered to be threatened in many of the states within its historical range. Natural predators of spotted skunks include larger carnivores such as domestic dogs, coyotes, foxes, feral cats and bobcats, and birds of prey such as owls. Ectoparasites found on Eastern Spotted Skunks include fleas and ticks, and endoparasites include various tapeworms, roundworms, and coccidian protozoans. Humans also are known to be a major cause of mortality because of the number of skunks hit by cars. Pneumonia and coccidiosis are diseases that have been reported in this species. Rabies has been reported, but rarely. Histoplasmosis has also been found, and microfilaria,listeriosis, mastitis, tularemia, distemper, and Q fever are likely to affect Eastern Spotted Skunks.","Bangs (1898b) | Choate et al.

Females tended not to engage in fatal fights, but remained defensive while in the same cage. Young animals will wrestle and screech at one another, but will also sleep together. Young animals will usually separate before reaching full adulthood. Spotted skunks have a patchy distribution throughout their range. Where they occur they can be found at a density of about nine animals per km? to about 20 and even 40 per km”. Eastern Spotted Skunks tend to move greater distances in the spring than in the summer and fall. Home ranges can be up to 4359 ha. Breeding. Reproduction in the Eastern Spotted Skunk is different from that in the Western Spotted Skunk. The main breeding season for this species is during March and April, although some individuals may breed again in July, August, or September to produce a second litter. Gestation is estimated to be from 50 to 65 days, with only a two-week period of delayed implantation. First-season litters are produced in late May and early June. Litter size averages five but ranges from 2-9 kits. Young are born naked or with sparse, fine, black and white pelage. The claws are well- developed at birth. The eyes and ears open at about 30 days and teeth become visible at 32 days. They can make squealing vocalizations at an early age. The young are weaned after about two months. Status and Conservation. Notlisted in CITES. Classified as Least Concern in The [UCN Red List. However, there has been concern over the lack of observations of this species throughout its range in the last few decades. Population densities of Eastern Spotted Skunks were believed to be low when settlers first arrived on the Great Plains. When small farm operations flourished there prior to the 1920s, spotted skunks became more numerous as farm buildings provided shelter as well as a supply of mice and rats. When the small farms gave way to larger operations, the density of spotted skunks became lower. Today, the Eastern Spotted Skunk is considered to be threatened in many of the states within its historical range. Natural predators of spotted skunks include larger carnivores such as domestic dogs, coyotes, foxes, feral cats and bobcats, and birds of prey such as owls. Ectoparasites found on Eastern Spotted Skunks include fleas and ticks, and endoparasites include various tapeworms, roundworms, and coccidian protozoans. Humans also are known to be a major cause of mortality because of the number of skunks hit by cars. Pneumonia and coccidiosis are diseases that have been reported in this species. Rabies has been reported, but rarely. Histoplasmosis has also been found, and microfilaria,listeriosis, mastitis, tularemia, distemper, and Q fever are likely to affect Eastern Spotted Skunks.

Individuals achieve their greatest weight by late summer. Hooded Skunks in the more southern part of their range are smaller than animals in the northern part of the range. Hooded Skunks have three typical color patterns, but there is considerable variation. These patterns are: two thin stripes running down the side of the body from the shoulder to midabdomen; a single band running down the back from the forehead to the tail (this single white stripe is interspersed with black hair giving a gray appearance), and a combination of both. These skunks also have a white bar between the eyes. The skull is similar to that of the Striped Skunk, but the auditory bullae are larger. Hooded Skunk can be differentiated externally from Striped Skunk by the long hairs on the back of the neck and head,its relatively longer tail, and larger ears. The anal secretions of the Hooded Skunk have seven major components, which comprise 99% of the volatiles. These components are (E)-2-butene-1-thiol, 3-methyl-1-butanethiol, S-(E)-2-butenyl thioacetate, S-3-methylbutenyl thioacetate, 2-phenylethanethiol, 2-methylquinoline, and 2-quinolinemethanethiol. There are several minor components as well, including phenylmethanethiol, S-phenylmethyl thioacetate, S-2-phenylethyl thioacetate, bis[(E)-2-butenyl] disulfide, (E)-2-butenyl 3-methylbutyl disulfide, bis(3-methylbutyl) disulfide, and S-2-quinolinemethyl thioacetate. The Hooded Skunk’s secretion contains four compounds not reported from the Striped Skunk: phenylmethanethiol, Sphenylmethyl thioacetate, 2-phenylethanethiol, and S-2-phenylethyl thioacetate.","This skunk occurs in a wide variety of temperate and tropical habitats. It is most common in arid lowlands, but also occurs in deciduous or ponderosa forest, forest edges, pastures, rocky canyons, and riparian habitats. Hooded Skunks use similar habitats to Striped Skunks, but are found more often in scrub and urban habitats. Hooded Skunks occur from sea level to 3110 m , in low elevation desert areas (below 2500 m ), in rocky canyons, or in heavily vegetated streamsides and valleys, often in association with mesquite, pine—oak, and other shrubs and grasses. Hooded Skunks appearto prefer intermediate elevationsin rockyslopes,at the bases ofcliffs, or on the rocky sides of arroyos, but are also encountered in heavy growth of weeds and shrubs in riparian areas. Dense, brushy cover of stream sides may be important for this species. Hooded Skunks den in holes dug in the ground, rock crevices, and holes in logs. They have even been observed denning more than 1 m above ground in trees, but they are more likely to den on rocky hillsides. They prefer woodland habitats more than do Striped Skunks. In agricultural areas Hooded Skunks den along fencerows, beneath irrigation canals, and in heavily vegetated areas along streams. Hooded Skunks are less likely than Striped Skunks to den around human dwellings. However, radio-collared individuals were frequently located under buildings and sheds and in culverts.","The diet of this species consists primarily of insects (including beetles and grasshoppers), fruits, small vertebrates, and birds’ eggs. Hooded Skunks break chicken eggs by throwing them between their back legs rather than biting them. Vertebrates are taken opportunistically. When foraging, Hooded Skunk moves slowly, snuffling among leaves and pouncing on grasshoppers and beetles. Activity patterns. Hooded Skunks remain active all year and have been trapped in the winter. The anal glands are used in self defense. One animal was observed spraying nine times in eleven seconds and again three more times 90 minutes later. The defensive behavior of Hooded Skunk is similar to that of Striped Skunk. Hooded Skunks are active after dusk and travel along rock walls, streambeds, and in weedy fields. They tend to be solitary except when females are raising young, although several may dine together at a feeding station. Females normally do not den together during the winter months. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Home ranges of Hooded Skunks can occupy from 2:8-5-0 km? Densities of 1:3-3-9 up to 25 Hooded Skunks/km?* have been reported. Females, when not nursing, tend to stay at a den site longer than males before moving to a different den within the home range. Males will move greater distances from one densite to the next compared to females. The skunks’ home ranges are smaller in urban areas. Urban skunks share mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes with non-urban skunks, which suggests that gene flow occurs between urban and non-urban skunk populations. Genetic data suggest that Hooded Skunks in urban areas represent newer, expanding populations (lower genetic diversity) compared to urban Striped Skunks, which have higher genetic diversity and more stable populations. They are more common in urbanized areas than previously thought, and in some places are more numerous than Striped Skunks. Their numbers are often underreported because it can be difficult to distinguish the two species.

The reproductive biology of the Hooded Skunk is poorly known. Breeding likely takes place from mid-February to the end of March. Males have a baculum, and females have two pairs of inguinal, one pair of abdominal, and two pairs of pectoral mammae. Litter size ranges from 3-8. Females may nurse young through August.","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Little is known about the status of this species, but they may not be uncommon in some parts of their range in the SW USA . However, in Texas , there is concern about population levels and that the species may no longer occur in that state. In Mexico, they are very abundant and survive in human-altered habitats such as cultivated fields, pastures, and suburban areas. There is a need for more research on Hooded Skunks. During a four year study period in Arizona , survival rates of adult skunks were low (24-56%). Predation accounted for most of the mortality, but disease and parasites were contributing factors. Great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), mountain lions, bobcats, jaguars, and coyotes may kill Hooded Skunks. Captive Hooded Skunks have lived for at least eight years. Historically, the pelt has not been considered to be of great value,so this skunk has not been hunted to the extent that other species have. Its fur is very long, light, and of low economic value. The flesh has been used for food in some areas, and the fat and scent glands have been used for medicinal purposes. Roundworms (Physaloptera maxillaries), fleas ( Pulicidae ), and the nematode Skrjabingylus chitwoodorum occur in Hooded Skunks in Trans Pecos, Texas . A new species of Skrjabingylus (S. santaceciliae) was recently described in this skunk species. Rabies rarely is reported in Hooded Skunks; however, a case of rabies in this species has been documented. There is no reason to suspect that they do not contract the virus; more likely they go unnoticed or are misidentified as Striped Skunks. Hooded Skunks also are susceptible to feline distemper. Hooded Skunks have been found with numerous fleas,ticks, lice, and mites.","Aranda & Lopez-de Buen (1999) | Armstrong et al. (1972) | Bailey (1931) | Baker (1956) | Carreno et al.

Females, when not nursing, tend to stay at a den site longer than males before moving to a different den within the home range. Males will move greater distances from one densite to the next compared to females. The skunks’ home ranges are smaller in urban areas. Urban skunks share mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes with non-urban skunks, which suggests that gene flow occurs between urban and non-urban skunk populations. Genetic data suggest that Hooded Skunks in urban areas represent newer, expanding populations (lower genetic diversity) compared to urban Striped Skunks, which have higher genetic diversity and more stable populations. They are more common in urbanized areas than previously thought, and in some places are more numerous than Striped Skunks. Their numbers are often underreported because it can be difficult to distinguish the two species. Skunks can actually be beneficial because they eat insect pests and rodents. Breeding. The reproductive biology of the Hooded Skunk is poorly known. Breeding likely takes place from mid-February to the end of March. Males have a baculum, and females have two pairs of inguinal, one pair of abdominal, and two pairs of pectoral mammae. Litter size ranges from 3-8. Females may nurse young through August. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Little is known about the status of this species, but they may not be uncommon in some parts of their range in the SW USA . However, in Texas , there is concern about population levels and that the species may no longer occur in that state. In Mexico, they are very abundant and survive in human-altered habitats such as cultivated fields, pastures, and suburban areas. There is a need for more research on Hooded Skunks. During a four year study period in Arizona , survival rates of adult skunks were low (24-56%). Predation accounted for most of the mortality, but disease and parasites were contributing factors. Great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), mountain lions, bobcats, jaguars, and coyotes may kill Hooded Skunks. Captive Hooded Skunks have lived for at least eight years. Historically, the pelt has not been considered to be of great value,so this skunk has not been hunted to the extent that other species have. Its fur is very long, light, and of low economic value. The flesh has been used for food in some areas, and the fat and scent glands have been used for medicinal purposes. Roundworms (Physaloptera maxillaries), fleas ( Pulicidae ), and the nematode Skrjabingylus chitwoodorum occur in Hooded Skunks in Trans Pecos, Texas . A new species of Skrjabingylus (S. santaceciliae) was recently described in this skunk species. Rabies rarely is reported in Hooded Skunks; however, a case of rabies in this species has been documented. There is no reason to suspect that they do not contract the virus; more likely they go unnoticed or are misidentified as Striped Skunks. Hooded Skunks also are susceptible to feline distemper. Hooded Skunks have been found with numerous fleas,ticks, lice, and mites. Bibliography. Aranda & Lopez-de Buen (1999), Armstrong et al. (1972), Bailey (1931), Baker (1956), Carreno et al.

Striped Skunks are about the size of house cats, with small triangularshaped heads. The basic color of skunksis black and white, but other colors, such as brown and red, have been observed in the wild. The typical pattern seen in Striped Skunksis the white “V7” down the back and a white bar running between the eyes from the forehead to the middle of the rostrum. Color pattern in Striped Skunksis highly variable and can range from completely black to completely white (non-albino). The striping pattern cannot be used to determine the sex of the animal, nor can it be used to predict how much snow will fall. Skunks are born with theirstripes before they have hair. The nose pad is relatively small, and the ears are small and rounded. Striped Skunks have short stocky legs and five toes on each foot. They walk on the soles (plantigrade) of their feet. Occasionally, the heel of the hindfeet will be lifted off the ground when they walk. The claws on the front feet are longer than those of the back feet. The tail is less than half the total body length, with long flowing hairs. The skull is heavy and squarish and widest at the attachment of the zygomata, and the forehead is convex. The dental formula for Striped Skunks is 13/3, C1/1,P 3/3, M 1/2, for a total of 34 teeth. The anal secretions of this animal are composed of several major volatile components. These components include: E)-2-butene-1-thiol, 3-methyl-1-butanethiol, S-(E)-2-butenyl thioacetate, $-3-methylbutanyl thioacetate, 2-methylquinoline, 2-quinolinemethanethiol, and $2-quinolinemethyl thioacetate.","Striped Skunks use a variety of habitats and tend to be more numerous where good cover and abundant food are available. They can be found in open, exposed arcas, but prefer brushy, weedy stream and gulch bottoms or canyons. In open areas they will burrow into banks or even level ground and as a result are able to occupy many habitats. Other habitats where they can be found include a mixture of woodlands, brushy corners, and open fields broken by wooded ravines and rocky outcrops. They will also utilize cultivated areas, pasture, and hay crops. In other parts of their range they use wetlands surrounded by agricultural areas, grasslands, woodlot edges, fencelines, and refuse piles. Striped Skunks may not have a preference for any particular habitat as long as food and shelter are available.","Striped Skunks are opportunistic omnivores. With the exception of lima beans, most skunks will eat almost anything. They will feast primarily on insects, such as beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, moths, cutworms, caterpillars, bees, and wasps. They also will eat earthworms, snakes, snails, clams, crayfish, fish, frogs, mice, moles, rats, squirrels, wild fruits, grains, corn, nuts, birds’ eggs, carrion, and garbage. Striped Skunks use their long foreclawsto dig for insects and grubs. They will search in rotten or fallen logs for mice and insects. Around gardens they will forage forripe fruits and vegetables, but they primarily are looking for insects, and benefit gardeners by eating insects that can damage garden crops. They also will take advantage of any pet food left outside. Activity patterns. Striped Skunks are crepuscular or nocturnal. In the northern part of their range they may go into a torpor (they are not true hibernators) during cold spells or when snow coveris particularly deep. However, in the southern parts of the range, they may actually be more active during the milder winters. When a Striped Skunk perceives a threat,its first responseis to run away. If that does not work, it will spray a noxious chemical from the anal scent glands. However, before spraying, skunks use a series of threat behaviors. They will stomp the ground with both front feet. Sometimes they will charge forward a few paces and then stomp or will edge backwards while dragging their front feet, all the while with the tail up in the air. Each scent gland has a nipple associated with it and skunks can aim and direct the spray with highly coordinated muscle control. When a skunk is being chased by a predator, but cannot see the predator, the spray is emitted as an atomized cloud that the predator must run through. This is the “shotgun” method and usually is enough to deter most predators. When the skunk has a target to focus on the spray is emitted as a stream directed at the predator’s face. This is the “357 Magnum” technique. Trapped or cornered skunks will curl into a “U” shape so that both ends face the predator. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Home ranges of Striped Skunks can be quite variable depending on the available resources (food and shelter primarily). Where there is plenty of food, skunks will tend to have smaller ranges. Home ranges are reported for anywhere from 0-5 km ? to over 12 km ?. Although Striped Skunks are often found dead on the road, they tend to avoid crossing roads with heavy traffic, and these roads can set the boundaries for some home ranges. During the winter months in the northern part of their range, Striped Skunks become more sedentary and cover less area on their nightly forays. In the southern part of their range, their home ranges remain about the samesize year-round. Striped Skunks are solitary most of the time. In the winter females (and occasionally a single male) may den together to conserve heatand body fat. Most malesare solitary during the winter.

Striped Skunk usually breed from February through March and the young are born starting in April, but births can continue until early June. These skunks usually only go into estrus once a year. However,if a litter is lost early a second litter may be produced. Striped Skunks will breed in their first year, and young males will exhibit breeding behavior in mid- to late summerof their first year, although they are not yet in reproductive condition. Females are usually in estrus for about a week and a half. Striped Skunks are induced ovulators. Ovulation occurs between 40 and 50 hours after first insemination. Males will breed with many females given the opportunity. Most of the females become pregnant by the end ofthe breeding season. Gestation usually lasts from 59-77 days. Females that breed early in the season may undergo a short period of delayed implantation. Striped Skunks can have as many as twelve offspring perlitter, but the average is about 5-7. Females usually have twelve mammae, but the number can range from ten to15. Young skunks are born blind, deaf, and naked. Within a couple of days the black and white hairs cover the pink and white skin. They are born with their scent glands intact and are capable of spraying within the first week of birth. The early scent is more a gas than a liquid. The eyes and ears open after about 28 days (sometimes earlier). After about 6-8 weeks the young are weaned. They begin to forage and explore with mom at this time. By the end of summer or early fall the young begin to disperse.","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Striped Skunks are not considered for any kind of protection as they appear to be doing well throughout their range. Some of the earliest legislation to protect skunks, in the form of closed trapping seasons, was in New York in 1894. Farmers recognized that skunks were the only effective predators of the hop grub and their service in combating the grub made them valuable assets. Striped Skunks are known to harbor numerous ectoparasites and endoparasites, including fleas, lice, ticks, mites, and various helminth infestations. Intestinal roundworms, nematodes, and lung flukes have been reported. Parasite loads can be a major contributor to mortality. Skunks are a primary vector of rabies in some parts of their range. They also have been found to be infected with canine distemper, histoplasmosis, leptospirosis, listerosis, mycoplasma, pulmonary aspergillosis, sarcocystis, streptococcus, toxoplasma, tularemia, and West Nile Virus. Natural mammalian predators for skunks include humans, domestic dogs, coyotes, red foxes, lynx, bobcats, badgers, mountain lions, and fishers. Various birds of prey including great horned owls, eagles, crows, and vultures also will eat skunks. Turnover in skunk populations is high, so a large percentage of animals in any population consist of young of the year. The average lifespan for wild skunksis about 2-3-5 years. However, Striped Skunks kept in captivity live on average to about 8-12 years of age.","Bailey (1931) | Baird (1857) | Bangs (1895, 1898a) | Bentler et al. (2007) | Blanton et al.

Typically, they are black and white, but they can range in color from black to dark brown or reddish brown. It has been suggested that the brownish color appears as the result of age. There is considerable variation in the striping pattern. Humboldt’s Hog-nosed Skunks do not have any white markings between the eyes. The tail generally is shorter in proportion to the body than in other skunks. The forelimbs and claws are well adapted for digging.

Beetles are found in abundance in skunk faeces even when beetles in the environment are more scarce, suggesting that beetles are a favorite food item. Activity patterns. These skunks are considered to be crepuscular, but can be active throughout the night with their activity usually starting between 19:00 h and 22:00 h. They are active most of the night and settle early in the morning, before 05:00 h. Much of their time is spent searching for food either by digging up insects or sniffing and searching around brush. They tend to dig less in winter when the ground is frozen. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunk is primarily solitary when foraging. Home ranges ofthis species (based on a small sample size) are from 3-5-12 times larger than home ranges in other Conepatus and average about 195 ha. Breeding. Little is known about the breeding behavior ofthis species. They have been reported to have a single breeding season, like the other South American skunks. They are similar in ecology and habit to the Humboldt’s Hog-nosed Skunk, so presumably they have a similar gestation period (approximately 60 days) and produce a single annual litter of 2-5 offspring. The breeding season may be longer than in other species. Status and Conservation. Molina’s Hog-nosed Skunks are notlisted with CITES, and are classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. These skunks too have been hunted and trapped for their pelts, which have been used to make blankets. They are susceptible to poisons set out for other animals. They are preyed upon by various birds of prey as well as larger mammalian carnivores. This species also harbors several internal and external parasites. Bibliography. Anderson (1997), Arias et al.

American Hog-nosed Skunk is as large as or larger than the Striped Skunk. They can be distinguished readily from other skunks by the color pattern of the dorsal pelage. These are the only skunks that lack a white dot or medial bar between the eyes and that have primarily black body fur with a single white stripe. The stripe starts as a single wedgeshaped white patch of fur on the head that widens near the shoulders to approximately half the width of the back. The stripe ranges from substantially reduced or absent on the rump to completely covering the entire back. The tail is white along its total length dorsally, but ventrally it can be black or white at the base. Their body generally is larger, and the tail is shorter in proportion to the body, than in other skunks. American Hog-nosed Skunks can be distinguished from the Striped Hog-nosed Skunks of Central and South America by the single dorsal stripe: the latter have two stripes bilateral to the spine. The snout of American Hog-nosed Skunk is relatively long and the nose pad, which is naked,is about 2 cm wide by 2: 6 cm long, and resembles the nose of a small hog. This species has small and rounded ears. Its legs are stocky and the feet are plantigrade. The hindfeet are broad and large; the soles are naked about half the length of the foot. The upper body is powerfully built for digging and climbing and the foreclaws are very long. The skull is relatively deep (deepest in the temporal region) and the nares are large and truncated. The auditory bullae are not inflated, and the palate ends behind upper molars. The carnassial teeth are not well-developed, and they as well as the large upper molar provide an increased crushing surface. The dental formula is I 3/3, C 1/1, P 2/3, M 1/2 = 32. Conepatus resorb the milk teeth prior to birth. The scent glands are at the base of the tail on either side of the rectum. Two major volatile components [(£)- 2-butene-1-thiol and (E)-$-2-butenyl thioacetate| and four minor components (phenylmethanethiol, 2-methylquinoline, 2-quinoline-methanethiol, and bis[(£)-2-butenyl| disulfide) are found in the anal sac secretions of American Hog-nosed Skunks.","American Hog-nosed Skunk can be found in canyons, stream beds, and rocky terrain. They also are found in open desertscrub and mesquite-grasslands. In the southcentral part of their range they can be found in tropical areas as well as in mountains and coastal plains. They also are known to visit cornfields surrounded by brush or grassy plains, and scattered thickets of bull-horn acacia and other thorny plants. They can be found in both thorn woodland and riparian forest. In thorn woodland, the trees can vary in density from sparse to thick enough to form a loose canopy. Trees associated with the riparian forest habitat include pecan (Carya illinoensis), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), and live-oak (Quercus virginiana). The understory of the riparian forests where hog-nosed skunks have been found includes briers, tall grasses, and tall weeds. American Hog-nosed Skunks have been found in pine—oak forest in the San Carlos Mountains, and north of these mountains on the Tamaulipan plain, which consists of low scrub and cacti. They also can occur in mesquitebrushland and improved pasture habitat where a few areas of semi-open native grassland have been used exclusively for cattle ranching. Thorny brush and cactus constitute the predominant vegetation in the region of southern Texas where these skunks occur.","They have been observed attacking and devouring small rodents. However, this species is more insectivorous by nature and will spend hours digging for grubs and larvae. They also will eat pears, raisins, squash, green beans, radishes, green peppers, and a variety of other fruits and vegetables (with the exception of lima beans). Naturalists have trouble finding bait suitable for trapping these carnivores and have often had to capture individuals by hand. These skunks also may be capable of obtaining their daily water requirements from their food depending on the moisture content of the menu. Activity patterns. These skunks are solitary and largely nocturnal, but not strictly so. They have been observed feeding during the heat of the day in New Mexico and Texas . They den in hollows in the roots of trees or fallen trunks and in cavities under rocks, and will take refuge in prickly pear cactus when aggravated. When an American Hognosed Skunk is threatened by a predator,its first response is to flee to cover. It may then turn to face its pursuer and, depending on the size and threat ofthe predator, stand on its hindlegs and even take two or three steps forward. Then it will come down hard on its front paws and exhale a burst of air in a loud hiss. Finally, it will draw its paws under its body, flinging dirt backwards. A defensive, frightened individual will crouch, stomp its front paws, raise its tail and hold it flat against its back, and bare its teeth. In this position it can bite and spray a predator, and will do both. American Hognosed Skunk can squirt a noxious liquid from anal scent glands, either as a mist when the threat is not specifically located, or as a stream directed toward a specific threat. The mist can be emitted while on the run. Movements, Home range and Social organization. American Hog-nosed Skunks are solitary by nature, but will tolerate each other as well as other species depending on the situation. Males and females stay together briefly during breeding season.

Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List, but populations have been declining for many years throughout a major portion of its historical range in the USA . The eastern Texas subspecies, ftelmalestes, is presumed extirpated throughoutits range in the Big Thicket region. In his Biological Survey of Texas , V. Bailey wrote, “the white-backed skunk is said to be the commonest species, and under a trapper’s shed at a ranch on Tarkington Prairie in November, 1904,I saw eight or ten of their skins hanging up to dry with a small number ofskins of Striped Skunk.” No new specimens of this subspecies have been collected in the Big Thicket area of Texas since Bailey's report in 1905. A telling, albeit fictional, explanation for the skunk’s decline is provided by Larry McMurtry, in his novel Lonesome Dove. one of his characters meets a couple in NE Texas . “In the dusk it was hard to make out much about her except that she was thin. She was barefoot and had on a dress that looked like it was made from part of a cotton sack. ‘I gave twenty-eight skunk hides for her,’ the old man said suddenly”. A more likely cause for the decline of hog-nosed skunk populations may be found in the increase in the number of trappers or possibly in the increased number of feral hogs that have been introduced into the area. Feral hogs compete, to some degree, with several species of wildlife for certain foods. They eat a variety of items, including fruits, roots, mushrooms, and invertebrates, depending on the season. Their rooting behavior is competitive with the rooting behavior of hog-nosed skunks. Feral hogs can have detectable influences on wildlife and plant communities as well as domestic crops and livestock, extensively disturbing vegetation and soil. In southern Texas , where 95% of the native vegetation in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas has been transformed from subtropical plant communities to cotton, sorghum, sugar cane, vegetable crops, and citrus orchards, several additional hog-nosed skunk populations may now be extirpated. However, a population was found recently in southern Texas and currently is being studied. Because hog-nosed skunks generally are associated with rough rocky areas and brushy habitat, the conversion of native vegetation to row-crop agriculture may be partially responsible for the skunks’ decline. However, habitat modification may not be the primary cause of the observed decline, because specimens of this skunk have been collected in cultivated areas near Veracruz, Mexico . A more direct cause may be associated with use of pesticides in agriculture. Hog-nosed skunks are primarily insectivorous, and use of pesticides has increased throughout their range in conjunction with row-crop agriculture. In Colorado, no new specimens ofthis species have been collected since 1933. However, a road-killed animal was seen just south of the Colorado border in New Mexico in 2003. American Hog-nosed Skunks are taken by many predators, mainly large canids and felids, and by birds of prey. Additionally, the skunks support numerous parasites. External parasites include fleas ( Pulex ) and ticks (Ixodes texanus); intestinal parasites are roundworms (Psyalopteris maxillaris) and cestodes; and subcutaneous nematodes (Filaria martis) and Skrjabingylus chitwoodorum —infect the frontal sinuses. In west Texas, American Hog-nosed Skunks have been found infected with several species of helminth parasites, including Filaroides milks, Filaria taxidaea, Gongylonema sp., Macracanthorhynchus ingens, Mathevotaenia mephitis, Oncicola canis, Pachysentis canicola, Physaloptera maxillaris, and P. rara. In natural habitats, hognosed skunks are not known to survive for more than three or four years, but American hog-nosed skunks can live for 16 years or more in captivity.","Bailey (1905) | Beasom (1974) | Dalquest (1953) | Davis (1951) | Davis & Schmidly (1994) | Dragoo (1993) | Dragoo & Honeycutt (1999a, 1999b) | Dragoo & Sheffield (In press) | Dragoo et al.

The body is squat but heavy, their legs are short, and they walk on plantigrade feet. The claws on the front feet are elongated, curved, and strong. The inner digits of the forepaws are joined by webbing and a muscle extending towards the tips. Stink badgers have small eyes and essentially vestigial external pinnae. The white stripes down the back can be divided, single and narrow, or absent. Like other members of the family the anal scent glands are well-developed and produce a noxious odor. The cheek teeth are rounded with low cusps rather than sectorial, and the first upper molaris larger than the last upper premolar.","Palawan Stink Badgers have been detected in mixed agriculture and secondary forest throughout Palawan as well as in residential and cultivated areas. They have been found in grasslands and grassland/forest mosaics, grassland-shrub, natural damp grassland, and open damp soil along streams. Occasionally, they have been reported in rice fields and freshwater swamp forests where they forage. Shrubs are commonly used for shelter. They also have been seen foraging along roads and paths.","Their diet consists of soft animal matter such as worms of every kind, birds’ eggs, carrion, insects (including crickets and small beetles), and insect grubs. They also consume small freshwater crabs as well as various plant parts. Their mobile snout and long claws are used for finding insects and freshwater molluscs. While foraging, stink badgers move slowly, rooting around in the uppersoil layer using their snout to dig out grubs. Activity patterns. Palawan Stink Badger is nocturnal, but has been seen active both day and night. While walking they are ungainly and awkward, but when startled can maintain a steady trot for 90 m . Even at a trot they are no faster than a walking human. Stink badgers walk with left and right feet apart, and hindfeet usually in line with front feet. Movements, Home range and Social organization.

Palawan Stink Badger Mydaus marchei French: Télagon de Palawan / German: Palawan-Stinkdachs / Spanish: Melandro de Palawan Other common names: Teledu , Skunk Badger Taxonomy. Mydaus marchei Huet, 1887 , I'ile Palaouan [Philippine Isles, Palawan ]. The species was once considered a separate genus, Suillotaxus, due to its smaller size, broader upper second premolar, and a shorter tail than that found in M. javanensis. However, this variation was later deemed to be no greater than that found in other species of the family. Monotypic. Distribution. Philippines ( Palawan I, Calamian I). Descriptive notes. Head-body 32-49 cm , tail 1-5— 4-5 cm ; weight 844-2490 g . Palawan Stink Badgers have a sharp face with an elongated and mobile muzzle. The body is squat but heavy, their legs are short, and they walk on plantigrade feet. The claws on the front feet are elongated, curved, and strong. The inner digits of the forepaws are joined by webbing and a muscle extending towards the tips. Stink badgers have small eyes and essentially vestigial external pinnae. The white stripes down the back can be divided, single and narrow, or absent. Like other members of the family the anal scent glands are well-developed and produce a noxious odor. The cheek teeth are rounded with low cusps rather than sectorial, and the first upper molaris larger than the last upper premolar. Habitat. Palawan Stink Badgers have been detected in mixed agriculture and secondary forest throughout Palawan as well as in residential and cultivated areas. They have been found in grasslands and grassland/forest mosaics, grassland-shrub, natural damp grassland, and open damp soil along streams. Occasionally, they have been reported in rice fields and freshwater swamp forests where they forage. Shrubs are commonly used for shelter. They also have been seen foraging along roads and paths. Food and Feeding. Their diet consists of soft animal matter such as worms of every kind, birds’ eggs, carrion, insects (including crickets and small beetles), and insect grubs. They also consume small freshwater crabs as well as various plant parts. Their mobile snout and long claws are used for finding insects and freshwater molluscs. While foraging, stink badgers move slowly, rooting around in the uppersoil layer using their snout to dig out grubs. Activity patterns. Palawan Stink Badger is nocturnal, but has been seen active both day and night. While walking they are ungainly and awkward, but when startled can maintain a steady trot for 90 m . Even at a trot they are no faster than a walking human. Stink badgers walk with left and right feet apart, and hindfeet usually in line with front feet. Movements, Home range and Social organization.

Spilogale is more weasel-like in body plan than any of the other genera (Mephatis, Conepatus , Mydaus ). Western Spotted Skunks are similar in color pattern to the Eastern Spotted Skunks in that they also have six stripes along the back and sides. One set ofstripes runs parallel to the backbone, and beside those stripes is another set that extends past the shoulders and over the ears. The third set of stripes runs from the shoulder to the abdomen and then curves upwards towards the back. There is also a spot on each of the hips. The color pattern may break up the body outline on moonless nights. Where the two species potentially come together the Western Spotted Skunks tends to have wider white stripes and a larger spot between the eyes. The Western Spotted Skunks is reportedly longer and more slender with a longertail than the Eastern Spotted Skunks. The feet each have five toes and locomotion is plantigrade. Western Spotted Skunks are quite capable climbers. The skull is flatter and wider than that of the Eastern Spotted Skunks, and the front region of the skull is depressed to the level of the cranium. The baculum of the Western Spotted Skunk is shorter than and not as curved as that of the Eastern Spotted Skunk. Western Spotted Skunks also have two muscular musk glands at the base of the tail inside the anal sphincter. These glands are capable of ejecting a noxious yellow fluid that is used in defense to deter a predator. The musk is composed of three major thiols, (E)-2-butene-I-thiol, 3-methyl-1- butanethiol, and 2-phenylethanethiol, and several minor components, including phenylmethanethiol, 2-methyl-quinoline, 2-quinoline methanethiol, bis[(E)-2-butenyl] disulfide, (E)-2-butenyl 3-methylbutyl disulfide, and bis(3-methylbutyl) disulfide. The Western Spotted Skunks does not have the thiol esters associated with the musk as seen in Mephitis and Conepatus . While the spray is as pungent as in the other skunks it does not have the “staying power” without the thiol esters.","These skunks are found along streams in riparian thickets composed of willows and cottonwoods or alder, salmonberry, tan oak and other hardwoods. They also occur in all stages of dry forests and pine-oak forests, and use canyons, cliffs, rock piles, lava fields, and dry valleys. They prefer areas where they can find cover protection from predators. These skunks will use tunnels and holes of other animals such as mountain beavers in Oregon and wood rats and ground squirrels in other parts of their range. Western Spotted Skunks have been found in older buildings in rural settings, but also have been taken in urban houses and apartments. They also will den around other man-made structures such as dams as long as protective cover is available.","Western Spotted Skunks eat a variety of food items. They are omnivores, but tend to have a mostly carnivorous diet. They eat small mammals, birds, and lizards. They consume a number of insects including grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, and ants. They also will eat fruits and vegetable matter to supplement their diets. Activity patterns. They are generally nocturnal. They prefer to move under the cover of darkness, but have been observed during daylight hours. When nervous they will walk with heavy deliberate steps. Spotted skunks are quite agile and are capable of climbing. Like other spotted skunks, they can perform handstands and walk on only their front paws. When faced with a potential predator, the skunk rushes forward, then stands on its forepaws with its hind end elevated off the ground. It can spray in this position, but usually drops to all fours and faces the predator with both ends before spraying. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Western Spotted Skunks usually den alone, but they use multiple dens. Dens may be used by multiple individuals, but not necessarily at the same time. The skunks usually den in areas that provide protective cover, such as under shrubs or prickly pear cactus. During the late summer and early fall months males tend to be captured more than females. This could be due to increased movement of males during the breeding season, which corresponds to these months. Young animals when playing will let out a loud, ear piercing, high pitched screech when excited. Young males of the same litter will wrestle more aggressively than females. They tend to leave the maternal den sooner in order to look for mates. Western Spotted Skunks have a patchy distribution throughout their range and very little study has been done of home range, density, and dispersal. However,in an island population these skunks have a larger home range (about twice the size) in the drier months than during the wet months.",,"They are generally nocturnal.

The island spotted skunk in California is listed as a subspecies of special concern. Several larger carnivores such as domestic dogs, coyotes, foxes, feral cats, bobcats, and birds of prey such as owls are known to prey on spotted skunks. Various intestinal parasites including tapeworms, roundworms, and coccidia have been found in spotted skunks. They also are susceptible to fleas and ticks. Humans have been known to trap and shoot spotted skunks for fur and they have been poisoned as non target animals during predator control efforts. In the USA , rabies has been reported, butit is rare.

Western Spotted Skunk Spilogale gracilis French: Moufette gracile / German: Westlicher Fleckenskunk / Spanish: Mofeta occidental Taxonomy. Spilogale gracilis Merriam, 1890 , Grand Canon of the Colorado (altitude 3500 feet ), Arizona , north of San Francisco Mountain. Western Spotted Skunks were once considered the same species as Eastern Spotted Skunks. Chromosomal and reproductive data have been used to elevate these skunks to specific status. Seven subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. S. g. gracilis Merriam, 1890 — W USA (from E Washington & E Oregon to NE California , and then E to W Montana & E Wyoming to C Colorado , and possibly the Black Hills, South Dakota . Then S to N New Mexico , N Arizona , C Nevada and E & C California ). S. g. amphialus Dickey, 1929 — SW USA (occurs only on Santa Rosa I and Santa Cruz I in Santa Barbara County, California ). S. g. latifrons Merriam, 1890 — SW Canada (SW British Columbia ) S and W to NW USA ( Washington and Oregon ). The distribution follows the crest of the Cascade Mts. S. g. leucoparia Merriam, 1890 — S USA (found from C Arizona , C New Mexico , and W & C central Texas ) S to N Mexico ( Coahuila & C Durango ). S. g. lucasana Merriam, 1890 — NW Mexico (S Baja California N to Santo Domingo on the W coast and La Paz on the E coast). S. g. martirensis Elliot, 1903 — NW Mexico (N & C Baja California ). S. g. phenax Merriam, 1890 — SW USA (From California west to crest of Sierra Nevada ). Descriptive notes. Head-body 25-37 cm (males) and 24-27 cm (females), tail 10-21 cm (males) and 8: 5-20.3 cm (females); weight 255-997 g (males) and 269-566 g (females). Spilogale is more weasel-like in body plan than any of the other genera (Mephatis, Conepatus , Mydaus ). Western Spotted Skunks are similar in color pattern to the Eastern Spotted Skunks in that they also have six stripes along the back and sides. One set ofstripes runs parallel to the backbone, and beside those stripes is another set that extends past the shoulders and over the ears. The third set of stripes runs from the shoulder to the abdomen and then curves upwards towards the back. There is also a spot on each of the hips. The color pattern may break up the body outline on moonless nights. Where the two species potentially come together the Western Spotted Skunks tends to have wider white stripes and a larger spot between the eyes. The Western Spotted Skunks is reportedly longer and more slender with a longertail than the Eastern Spotted Skunks. The feet each have five toes and locomotion is plantigrade. Western Spotted Skunks are quite capable climbers. The skull is flatter and wider than that of the Eastern Spotted Skunks, and the front region of the skull is depressed to the level of the cranium. The baculum of the Western Spotted Skunk is shorter than and not as curved as that of the Eastern Spotted Skunk. Western Spotted Skunks also have two muscular musk glands at the base of the tail inside the anal sphincter. These glands are capable of ejecting a noxious yellow fluid that is used in defense to deter a predator.

Adult males may be slightly larger than females. Head is broad; fairly pointed muzzle; nose pad brown to dark. Ears are short, broad at the base and rounded; there is a single brown-black spot behind ear pinnae. Iris is brownish-orange. Pelage is short, woolly, and dense. Coat color is relatively uniform across the body, and varies from grayish to dark brown; ventral pelage slightly paler. There is a wide range of individual variation in both color and spot markings. Albinism seems extremely rare (one albino individual collected in DR Congo ). Back exhibits a characteristic pair of whitish yellow spots on shoulders, and irregularly distributed dark spots that may partly coalesce in the nape (nucchal) region. One to three clearly defined dark lines on neck. Limbs are short, thickset, and poorly spotted. Five claws are partially retractile. Feet plantigrade; pads extremely well-developed, reaching wrist in forefoot and ankle in hindfoot. Tail is longer than length of head and body (110-120%), densely furred, and has nine to 15 irregularly marked dark rings; rings are generally incomplete on the underside. Both sexes have a glandular abdominal pouch situated anterior to the vulva or penis, about 55 mm long, 20 mm deep, and 20-30 mm wide when open. It shows a simpler structure than the perineal glands usually found in viverrids, and produces a yellowish liquid with a musky odor comparable to the “musk” ofcivets and genets. Skull differs from other extant carnivorans by the persistence throughoutlife of the cartilaginous condition of the posterior chamber of the auditory bulla. Rostrum is moderately elongated; zygomatic arches are wide and sagittal crest is generally thin and elevated. Dental formula: I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. Variation in the presence/absence of M?* exists. Chromosome number: 2n = 38; FN = 66. Geographic variations in coat pattern have been described. In gerrardi, dark stripes on neck are absent, body is sparsely and finely spotted, the pair of bright scapular spots is weakly distinct, and dark tail rings are narrow and sharply defined. In arborea, nucchalstripes are present but narrow, lower sides of body are not spotted, and dark tail rings are thin. In intensa, coat color is redder and brighter, spots are intense black and the pair of bright scapular spots is more striking to the eye.","Occurs from lowland to montane tropical rainforest, up to 2500 m (e.g. Cameroon , Tanzania ). Also present in riparian and deciduousforests, savannah woodlands, and disturbed forests after logging or cultivation.","Although predominantly frugivorous, they are able to adjust energetic resources with opportunistic foraging on vertebrates (essentially murids, more rarely pottos), birds’ eggs, and arthropods. In Gabon , average stomach content was about 80% fruit and 20% diverse prey items. May frequently raid crops and poultry; can be found eating carrion. Fruits are generally consumed in 5-10 minutes, followed generally by a rest taken on a branch 10-20 m away; such frugivorous meals are taken approximately every two hours. Transit is fast and fruit remains are eliminated 2-3 hours after consumption, which might contribute to seed dispersal across the forest (in Kenya , supposed to spread twelve species of plants). There have been reports of 12-15 individuals feeding at the same time on the fruit of the parasol tree (Musanga cecropioides). During encounters between genders, females seem to be given priority access to food. Forefeet used extensively when attacking. Prey is usually pressed and held on the substratum, and then killed byseveral rapid bites all over the body. They are reported to drink palm wine directly from vessels in palm trees in Sierra Leone and the Niger Delta. Captive individuals showed attraction for alcohol that may result from consumption of fermented fallen fruits and tree exudates in the wild. Activity patterns. Nocturnal and arboreal. During the day, usually rests on large horizontal branches and lianas, in elevated tree holes, or in crevices formed by vegetation 12-15 m above ground. They use the ground to cross deforested areas or to forage. Plantigrade locomotion and large, deeply carunculated, transversely ridged pads of hindfeet allow agile tree climbing. Able to climb a smooth post and descend head first by “vertical looping”, i.e. gripping the trunk, spread-eagled, with claws and hairless pads of forefeet, then bringing both hindfeet forward until they touch the forefeet. Tail maybe used as a balancing rod when walking thin branches; although not prehensile, can be wrapped around branches for support. Able to walk on steel wire andjump across gaps up to 1 m wide and as high as 1.8 m . An individual was observed soaring from high branches, with tail extended and legs stretched out, and making a perfect four-point landing. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Movements of individuals remain poorly understood. In Gabon , males have home ranges between 34 and 153 ha (mean 85 ha), larger than those of females (29-70 ha, mean 45 ha). Home range size in males is dependent on number of available females rather than nutritional resources. Although adult male home ranges often overlap broadly, they consist of distinct sectors. Large males tend to visit all sectors regularly while smaller males stay in their own sectors to avoid dominant males. Home ranges of dominant males may cover home ranges of several females. Adult females have clearly delimited home ranges with narrow overlap zones along borders, where scent marks are deposited. Immature daughters usually remain with their mothers; young males apparently abandon the maternal home range as soon as they are weaned. Dominant males seldom meet, but fights may be extremely violent and fatal to the loser. Sexual competition appears to accentuate weight differ ences in males, with dominant ones often becoming heavy. Non-dominant males tend to be thinner, with smallertesticles and perineal glands as symptoms of socialstress. In Gabon , estimate of minimum mean density was about 5 ind/km®, with higher means in inundated forests and river borders (reaching 8 ind/km?). In Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda , mean density was higher above 2000 m elevation than below 1800 m (3-32 ind/km? and 2-17 ind/km?, respectively). Usually, individuals sleep alone, but occasionally a male and female can be found resting close to one another. Scent marking plays a significant role in communication. The perineal gland is rubbed on branches by flexing the hindlimbs; the odor can persist for several months. Other scent glands, such as the one located between the third and fourth toe of each foot, may also be used to scent-mark trails. Individuals produce a typical loud, plaintive cry similar to a lengthy “hoo”, which can be heard over a distance of almost 1 km . In Gabon , calls between genders were at their maximum when a female was in estrus, in June.",,"Nocturnal and arboreal.

In Gabon , calls between genders were at their maximum when a female was in estrus, in June. Breeding. During courtship, a captive pair at close range emitted sounds akin to coughing. In Gabon , births mostly occurred from September to January (wet season and start of short dry season), occasionally in other months, but never during March—June. Gestation is about 64 days; there are two litters per year, usually of two young each. Birth weight averages about 56 g . Neonates have eyes and ears closed; they accompany mother to visit fruit trees as soon as they are able. Theyattain adult size and weight at 6-9 months. Captivity records report maximum longevity of 16 to 18 years.","CITES: not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Probably the most common small carnivore in African forests, although field censuses are rare. In Gabon , biomass estimates neared 11 kg /km? which is greater than that of sympatric carnivorans such as genets and civets. Local threats include destruction of individuals caught preying on poultry. They are also hunted for the bushmeat and traditional medicine markets: they are the most common carnivore sold in markets in Equatorial Guinea and Guinea . The skin is used to make ceremonial clothes, wrist-bracelets, and hats. Their association with closed-canopy habitat suggests vulnerability to intense logging, which is occurring at a high rate in western Africa, and to deforestation in eastern and southern Africa. They are preyed upon by larger carnivorans, birds of prey, and pythons. In Cameroon , it is part of the natural reservoir stock for trypanosomiasis. Due to their arboreal mode oflife, African Palm Civets are subject to falls and bone fractures.","Allen, G.M. (1939) | Allen, J.A.

Both sexes have a glandular abdominal pouch situated anterior to the vulva or penis, about 55 mm long, 20 mm deep, and 20-30 mm wide when open. It shows a simpler structure than the perineal glands usually found in viverrids, and produces a yellowish liquid with a musky odor comparable to the “musk” ofcivets and genets. Skull differs from other extant carnivorans by the persistence throughoutlife of the cartilaginous condition of the posterior chamber of the auditory bulla. Rostrum is moderately elongated; zygomatic arches are wide and sagittal crest is generally thin and elevated. Dental formula: I 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. Variation in the presence/absence of M?* exists. Chromosome number: 2n = 38; FN = 66. Geographic variations in coat pattern have been described. In gerrardi, dark stripes on neck are absent, body is sparsely and finely spotted, the pair of bright scapular spots is weakly distinct, and dark tail rings are narrow and sharply defined. In arborea, nucchalstripes are present but narrow, lower sides of body are not spotted, and dark tail rings are thin. In intensa, coat color is redder and brighter, spots are intense black and the pair of bright scapular spots is more striking to the eye. Habitat. Occurs from lowland to montane tropical rainforest, up to 2500 m (e.g. Cameroon , Tanzania ). Also present in riparian and deciduousforests, savannah woodlands, and disturbed forests after logging or cultivation. Food and Feeding. Although predominantly frugivorous, they are able to adjust energetic resources with opportunistic foraging on vertebrates (essentially murids, more rarely pottos), birds’ eggs, and arthropods. In Gabon , average stomach content was about 80% fruit and 20% diverse prey items. May frequently raid crops and poultry; can be found eating carrion. Fruits are generally consumed in 5-10 minutes, followed generally by a rest taken on a branch 10-20 m away; such frugivorous meals are taken approximately every two hours. Transit is fast and fruit remains are eliminated 2-3 hours after consumption, which might contribute to seed dispersal across the forest (in Kenya , supposed to spread twelve species of plants). There have been reports of 12-15 individuals feeding at the same time on the fruit of the parasol tree (Musanga cecropioides). During encounters between genders, females seem to be given priority access to food. Forefeet used extensively when attacking. Prey is usually pressed and held on the substratum, and then killed byseveral rapid bites all over the body. They are reported to drink palm wine directly from vessels in palm trees in Sierra Leone and the Niger Delta. Captive individuals showed attraction for alcohol that may result from consumption of fermented fallen fruits and tree exudates in the wild. Activity patterns. Nocturnal and arboreal. During the day, usually rests on large horizontal branches and lianas, in elevated tree holes, or in crevices formed by vegetation 12-15 m above ground. They use the ground to cross deforested areas or to forage. Plantigrade locomotion and large, deeply carunculated, transversely ridged pads of hindfeet allow agile tree climbing. Able to climb a smooth post and descend head first by “vertical looping”, i.e. gripping the trunk, spread-eagled, with claws and hairless pads of forefeet, then bringing both hindfeet forward until they touch the forefeet. Tail maybe used as a balancing rod when walking thin branches; although not prehensile, can be wrapped around branches for support. Able to walk on steel wire andjump across gaps up to 1 m wide and as high as 1.8 m . An individual was observed soaring from high branches, with tail extended and legs stretched out, and making a perfect four-point landing. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Movements of individuals remain poorly understood. In Gabon , males have home ranges between 34 and 153 ha (mean 85 ha), larger than those of females (29-70 ha, mean 45 ha). Home range size in males is dependent on number of available females rather than nutritional resources. Although adult male home ranges often overlap broadly, they consist of distinct sectors. Large males tend to visit all sectors regularly while smaller males stay in their own sectors to avoid dominant males. Home ranges of dominant males may cover home ranges of several females. Adult females have clearly delimited home ranges with narrow overlap zones along borders, where scent marks are deposited. Immature daughters usually remain with their mothers; young males apparently abandon the maternal home range as soon as they are weaned. Dominant males seldom meet, but fights may be extremely violent and fatal to the loser. Sexual competition appears to accentuate weight differ ences in males, with dominant ones often becoming heavy. Non-dominant males tend to be thinner, with smallertesticles and perineal glands as symptoms of socialstress. In Gabon , estimate of minimum mean density was about 5 ind/km®, with higher means in inundated forests and river borders (reaching 8 ind/km?). In Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda , mean density was higher above 2000 m elevation than below 1800 m (3-32 ind/km? and 2-17 ind/km?, respectively). Usually, individuals sleep alone, but occasionally a male and female can be found resting close to one another. Scent marking plays a significant role in communication. The perineal gland is rubbed on branches by flexing the hindlimbs; the odor can persist for several months. Other scent glands, such as the one located between the third and fourth toe of each foot, may also be used to scent-mark trails. Individuals produce a typical loud, plaintive cry similar to a lengthy “hoo”, which can be heard over a distance of almost 1 km . In Gabon , calls between genders were at their maximum when a female was in estrus, in June. Breeding. During courtship, a captive pair at close range emitted sounds akin to coughing. In Gabon , births mostly occurred from September to January (wet season and start of short dry season), occasionally in other months, but never during March—June. Gestation is about 64 days; there are two litters per year, usually of two young each. Birth weight averages about 56 g . Neonates have eyes and ears closed; they accompany mother to visit fruit trees as soon as they are able. Theyattain adult size and weight at 6-9 months. Captivity records report maximum longevity of 16 to 18 years. Status and Conservation. CITES: not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Probably the most common small carnivore in African forests, although field censuses are rare. In Gabon , biomass estimates neared 11 kg /km? which is greater than that of sympatric carnivorans such as genets and civets. Local threats include destruction of individuals caught preying on poultry. They are also hunted for the bushmeat and traditional medicine markets: they are the most common carnivore sold in markets in Equatorial Guinea and Guinea . The skin is used to make ceremonial clothes, wrist-bracelets, and hats. Their association with closed-canopy habitat suggests vulnerability to intense logging, which is occurring at a high rate in western Africa, and to deforestation in eastern and southern Africa. They are preyed upon by larger carnivorans, birds of prey, and pythons. In Cameroon , it is part of the natural reservoir stock for trypanosomiasis. Due to their arboreal mode oflife, African Palm Civets are subject to falls and bone fractures. Bibliography. Allen, G.M. (1939), Allen, J.A.

The underfur is dense and grayish-buff; in some specimens,it tends to show through the guard hairs, particularly on the flanks, which gives a paler gray appearance to these parts. The muzzle is blunt, with a large rhinarium divided by a naked median groove that continues downward and divides the upperlip. The ears are short and wide and the eyes have a horizontal pupil with a grayish-brown iris. The tail is covered with long dark hairs (up to 60 mm ). The limbs are black or dark brown. The foreand hindfeet have four digits; the hallux and pollex are missing. The digits have stout, curved claws, which on the forefoot are 8-9 mm long and usually show considerable wear; on the hindfoot they measure up to 10-11 mm. The hindfeet have hairs up to the back of the plantar pads; the forefeet have a short naked section behind the pads. There are two pairs of teats and the baculum in the male is 15 mm long. The skull is elongated, with the zygomatic width 50% of the total length. The braincase is ovoid and broadest at the level of the jaw articulation;it narrows to the postorbital constriction, which averages 85% of the inter-orbital width. The post-orbital bar is never complete. The rostrum is long (31% of the length of the skull), but the nasal bones are well behind the incisors. The supra-occipital crest is welldeveloped, reaching 4 mm in adults. The sagittal crest is high at the back of the braincase and the zygomatic arches are heavily built. The anterior chambers of the auditory bullae are not inflated. Dental formula: 1 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The upper canines are nearly straight, with sharp cutting edges; the lower canines are recurved. The first premolars are small and peg-like, the second premolars have a normal shape, and the third and fourth premolars are broader than in other herpestid species. The two molars are broad and rectangular. The dentition clearly indicates an adaptation to crushing rather than to slicing.","Wooded grasslands, Acacia and Brachystegia woodlands, montane and bamboo forests, coral-rag thicket, and groundwater forests. In Kenya , it is recorded at the base of hills with rocky outcrops and boulders, where the vegetation is grassland with scattered shrubs and trees (especially Acacia sp. and Commiphora africana ), and also rambling herbs on the hillsides ( Cissus quadrangularis , Sarcostemma spp., and Ficus spp.). Along the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts, the Bushy-tailed Mongoose is found in thick rainforest; in Kenya , one individual was observed approximately 300 m from the forest edge, along a dirt road, between a large open grassland area (with bush and small patches of forest) and a plantation of pine ( Pinus caribaea ).

However, Yellow Mongooses are opportunistic feeders and will also hunt rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and arachnids (scorpions and spiders). The diet varies both geographically and seasonally. In Botswana , the percentage occurrence of prey items in 54 stomachs was: 92% insects, 15% small mammals (murids), 13% scorpions, 11% reptiles, 4% Myriapoda, 2% birds, and 2% amphibians. In the former Transvaal ( South Africa ), the percentage occurrence of prey items in 76 stomachs was: 87% invertebrates (mostly termites and locusts) and 28% vertebrates (including mammals, birds, and amphibians). In the Western Cape ( South Africa ), the percentage occurrence in 332 scats was: 90% insects (mostly Isoptera), 40% rodents (including Bush Vlei Rat Otomys unisulcatus , Four-striped Grass Mouse Rhabdomys pumilio , Pygmy Mouse Mus minutoides ), 12% birds, and 13% reptiles; the occurrence of rodents varied during the year according to the fluctuating population densities of rodents. In the Karoo ( South Africa ), 86 scats contained: 100% insects (mostly Coleoptera and Orthoptera), 10% birds, and 3% rodents. In the Free State ( South Africa ), the percentage occurrence in 156 stomachs was 74% Isoptera; 48% Orthoptera, 42% Coleoptera , 22% Lepidoptera; vertebrates and other invertebrate groups occurred at much lower percentages. In central South Africa , the analysis of 95 stomachs found rodents to have a higher occurrence than insects. Yellow Mongooses are also known to feed occasionally on fruits and carrion (such as Common Duiker Sylvicapra grimmia and South African Spring Hare Pedetes capensis ). They may also eat hens and their eggs, but anecdotal reports of preying on newborn lambs are considered false. Yellow Mongooses usually forage individually, but they have been seen in pairs or in small groups. Foraging typically occurs during the early morning and late afternoon. On the west coast of South Africa , a radio-tracking study indicated that 37% of the time was spent foraging. In the Eastern Cape , they have been observed feeding throughout the day, except during the hottest days of the summer. Activity patterns. Mainly diurnal. During the night they rest in dens, which they enter around sunset and exit shortly after sunrise. Yellow Mongooses occasionally rest around midday for variable periods of time. They can become active at night, especially in cases of exceptional food availability (e.g. termites swarming). Movements, Home range and Social organization. Yellow Mongooses are solitary foragers, but spend nights in communal dens and cooperate in raising their young. Mean group size varies from 1-13, but is usually three or four. The group typically comprises a dominant male, with separate hierarchies for the subordinate females and males. Juveniles are the lowest ranking. To assess dominancestatus, two individuals approach one another and sniff each other’s facial glands. The dominant individual rises higher on its feet while biting the subordinate’s neck. The subordinate lies on its side and may emit a high-pitched scream. A dominant individual marks a subordinate by straddling it from above and using the anal glands in a standing position. In one colony, the dominant male marked colony members on a daily basis. In another colony, the dominant male was not involved in dominance interactions, but high-ranking subordinates deferred to the dominant males, and in turn dominated lower ranking members. In South Africa (West Coast National Park), the mean home range of three males was 1 km ? (range = 0-7 to 1-2), and 0-3 km? for four females (range = 0-1-0-5). Overlap among males was substantial and individual home ranges overlapped those of several females, while the ranges of females in different burrows showed almost no overlap. Males and females move similar distances per hour (mean = 292 m /h and 228 m /h, respectively); males move an average ofjust over 3 km per day. Yellow Mongooses are partly nomadic, and may rotate the use of several burrow systems on different nights, within a much larger territory. Defecation takes place in latrines close to burrows or along a group territory. The anal glands are used in scent marking home ranges and allomarking between colony members. The dominant pair and juvenile females concentrate their markings mainly around the burrow. Objects may also be marked by means of the cheek gland, often preceded by wiping the entire side of the body on the ground or side-swiping. All members of the group help mark, although most marking is done by younger, subordinate individuals. Five vocalizations have been recognized: a high-pitched scream (uttered during fighting); a low growl (when an individual was disturbed at a food source); an even lower growl (when approached in a live trap); a short barking sound (alarm call); and a soft purring uttered during copulation.",,"Mainly diurnal.

Breeding. There is no reproductive suppression in a colony so that more than one female can breed simultaneously. Mating starts in earlyJuly. When females are in estrus, males purr, “caw”, and scream, while following the females around and attempting to mount. Estrus females will allow copulation over a two-day period, after which males are vocally rebuffed with bites to the head and neck. Two observed copulations lasted 37 and 45 minutes. During copulation, the male purrs, while the female bites or licks the male’s ears and neck. Gestation is 60-62 days. Birth season is probably from August to January (until March in Botswana ). Litter size is one to five, most commonly two; some females may have two litters per year. The young are born in nesting chambers in the burrows. Adult “helpers” (some of the previous year’s offspring that remain in the natal group) provision young at their dens for the first four weeks, carrying back large prey items (rodents, bats, reptiles, and large arachnoids). The young first accompany adults on foraging expeditions at about eight weeks of age.

A small mongoose, with short legs and a long, bushy tail (c. 90% of head and body length). The body and tail are grizzled gray (from light gray to dark brownish-gray); the underparts are less grizzled. The muzzle and legs are darker. The head is pointed. The ears are slightly darker, small, close to the head, and partly covered by a band of longer hairs. The rhinarium is small, with a central depression that continues downwards and divides the haired section of the upperlip. The tip ofthe tail is sometimes inconspicuously shaded brown (the hair on thetail is short: less than 20 mm ). Individual guard hairs are black or gray, with four to six white to yellowish bands. There are five digits on each foot, with the first one reduced. The heel pad is not haired and the claws are not very long. Females have three pairs of mammae. Skull length usually more than 67 mm (males) and less than 63 mm (females), with ovoid braincase and short rostrum. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 3/4, M 2/2 = 38.

In the upperjaw, the first molar is small, and the second molaris very small.","Found in a wide range of habitats, in forested as well as non-forested areas, but generally avoids open spaces. Occurs mainly in Karoo and Karroid bushveld, and sclerophyllous bush, and is often associated with refuge areas such as dense bushes and rocky outcrops, but avoids open fields with short vegetation. More common in dry than in wet areas (especially areas with a warm temperate climate), butis absent from the driest parts of the region (Kalahari thornveld; rainfall below 20 cm ). Sometimes found close to human settlements. Recorded from sea level (around the Western Cape ) to 1900 m ( KwaZulu-Natal ).","An opportunistic predator,its diet includes a wide range of prey from termites and grasshoppers to snakes and rodents. Nevertheless, the staple foods are generally small mammals or insects. In the West Coast National Park ( Western Cape ), murids predominated in the diet (90%), with insects (5%) forming a secondary food resource. Vlei rats and Foursstriped Grass Mouse appear to be favored murid prey. It has been recorded feeding on larger mammals such as Scrub Hares ( Lepus saxatilis ) and Cape Porcupine ( Hystrix africaeaustralis ), and has even been known to attack and kill Cape Grysbok ( Raphiceros melanotis ) lambs by tearing at the nose and mouth. However, because it scavenges, it is uncertain to what extent large prey in the diet is the result of active predation. They have been observed to associate with small raptors (African marsh harrier Circus ranivorus ) while foraging. Usually moves from bush to bush, inspecting potential foraging sites like holes and rodent nests. It seems to rely mainly on sight and smell for food searching. It scratches the soil in search of invertebrates, but is not an avid digger. Insects caught on the ground are held down with the front feet and then taken directly in the mouth. Larger prey are stalked, the killing bite delivered to the head. Small mammals are chewed in the side of the mouth. Insects are thoroughly masticated. Larger and tougher prey is held firmly on the ground with the front feet and torn apart. Cape Gray Mongooses can break eggs by throwing them against a vertical surface. Activity patterns. Predominantly diurnal; activity is more common at sunset and sunrise, but is reduced in bad weather and at high temperatures. Occasionally rests for variable lengths of time around midday. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Normally seen singly, but groups of up to five have been recorded (more often in summer and early autumn, after parturition). Of 163 sightings, 151 were of single animals, seven were of pairs, and five were of groups of three. Groups typically consist of one or two adults and juveniles. Males may show some sociality, with stable pairs composed of a large and a small individual. In the West Coast National Park ( Western Cape ), home range sizes of three males were 55-92 ha; a female had the smallest range (30-6 ha); another female, ajuvenile, ranged more widely (359 ha), possibly dispersing. Home ranges overlapped widely, both within and between sexes. In the Vrolijkheid Nature Conservation Station (Little Karoo region, South Africa ) the mean home range size of four animals was between 5-36 ha, and there appeared to be considerable overlap in home ranges. While foraging, individuals usually move 50-100 m every 15 minutes, and travel on average, 4 km during the course of a day’s foraging.",,"Predominantly diurnal; activity is more common at sunset and sunrise, but is reduced in bad weather and at high temperatures.

Cape Gray Mongoose Galerella pulverulenta French: Mangouste du Cap / German: Kap-Schlankichneumon / Spanish: Mangosta de El Cabo Taxonomy. Herpestes pulverulentus Wagner, 1839 , type locality “ Cape ”, exact locality unknown. The Cape Gray Mongoose has been placed in the genus Galerella o Herpestes by different authors. Traditionally, six subspecies were recognized: ruddi , nigrata , shortridger , basutica , annulata , and the nominate form, although skull morphological analyses failed to reveal any quantitative distinctiveness. G . nigrata , annulata , and shortridgei are now regarded as synonyms of G. flavescens . Three subspecies are recognized here. Subspecies and Distribution. G. p. pulverulenta Wagner, 1839 — Namibia , South Africa (Western, Eastern and Northern Cape & Free State ). G. p. basutica Roberts, 1936 — E Lesotho to South Africa (W KwaZulu-Natal ). G. p. rudd : Thomas, 1903 — South Africa (extreme NW portion of the species range). Descriptive notes. Head-body 34-42 cm (males), 33-35. 5 cm (females), tail 20.5-34 cm (both sexes), hindfoot 5:9.7-5 cm (males), 5.2-7. 5 cm (females), ear 1.5-3. 6 cm (both sexes); weight 680-1250 g (males), 491-900 g (females). A small mongoose, with short legs and a long, bushy tail (c. 90% of head and body length). The body and tail are grizzled gray (from light gray to dark brownish-gray); the underparts are less grizzled. The muzzle and legs are darker. The head is pointed. The ears are slightly darker, small, close to the head, and partly covered by a band of longer hairs. The rhinarium is small, with a central depression that continues downwards and divides the haired section of the upperlip. The tip ofthe tail is sometimes inconspicuously shaded brown (the hair on thetail is short: less than 20 mm ). Individual guard hairs are black or gray, with four to six white to yellowish bands. There are five digits on each foot, with the first one reduced. The heel pad is not haired and the claws are not very long. Females have three pairs of mammae. Skull length usually more than 67 mm (males) and less than 63 mm (females), with ovoid braincase and short rostrum. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 3/4, M 2/2 = 38. The outer incisors are slightly larger than the inner ones. The lower canines are distinctly curved. In the upperjaw, the first molar is small, and the second molaris very small. Habitat. Found in a wide range of habitats, in forested as well as non-forested areas, but generally avoids open spaces. Occurs mainly in Karoo and Karroid bushveld, and sclerophyllous bush, and is often associated with refuge areas such as dense bushes and rocky outcrops, but avoids open fields with short vegetation. More common in dry than in wet areas (especially areas with a warm temperate climate), butis absent from the driest parts of the region (Kalahari thornveld; rainfall below 20 cm ). Sometimes found close to human settlements. Recorded from sea level (around the Western Cape ) to 1900 m ( KwaZulu-Natal ). Food and Feeding. An opportunistic predator,its diet includes a wide range of prey from termites and grasshoppers to snakes and rodents. Nevertheless, the staple foods are generally small mammals or insects. In the West Coast National Park ( Western Cape ), murids predominated in the diet (90%), with insects (5%) forming a secondary food resource. Vlei rats and Foursstriped Grass Mouse appear to be favored murid prey.

Short-tailed Mongoose Herpestes brachyurus French: Mangouste a queue courte / German: Kurzschwanzmungo / Spanish: Meloncillo colicorto Taxonomy. Herpestes brachyurus Gray, 1837, Malacca , Malaysia . Hose’s Mongoose H . hose : from Borneo is known only from one specimen (an adult female) collected from Sarawak in 1893. This was treated as a separate species on the basis of a less rounded coronoid process of the lower mandible, but has also been considered an aberrant specimen of the Short-tailed Mongoose, and is here considered as a synonym of H . brachyurus . The Collared Mongoose ( H . semitorquatus ) has also been considered a subspecies of H . brachyurus , but is now generally accepted as a valid species. Several subspecies of the Short-tailed Mongoose have been proposed, but a taxonomic revision is needed. The subspecies javanensis was described from a menagerie specimen labelled from Java , but there are no other records from this island. Four subspecies are recognized here. Subspecies and Distribution. H. b. brachyurus Gray, 1837 — S Thailand , Peninsular Malaysia , and Singapore . H. b. palawanusJ .A. Allen, 1910 — the Philippines ( Palawan & Calamian Is). H. b. rajah Thomas, 1921 — Borneo. H. b. sumatrius Thomas, 1921 — Sumatra . Descriptive notes. Head-body 35-49 cm (males), 36.8-46 cm (females), tail 19.3-24. 5 cm (males), 17.2-25 cm (females), hindfoot 7.5-9. 6 cm (males), 7.9-9. 3 cm (females), ear 2.3-2 cm (males), 2.8-3. 2 cm (females); weight 1-3 kg (males), 1.2-2.5 kg (females). The general coat color is dark brown, finely marked with orange or yellow speckling. The head is paler and more olive-brown, the forelegs and lower half of the hindlegs are dark brown, the cheeks and throat rusty yellowish-brown, and the chest and belly are brown. Thetail is short, usually less than 55% of the head-body length, and tapers from the base to the tip. The eyes are reddish-brown with a horizontal, oval pupil; the ears are small, and the nose is large and reddish-orange. There are five digits on the foreand hindfeet, although the first digits are much smaller than the rest. The claws are long. The posterior chamber of the auditory bulla is less flat than in the Javan Mongoose and extends to well below the occipital condyle. Dental formula: 13/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The cuspids are sharp and the carnassial shear is well-developed. Habitat. Primary and disturbed forest; often found close to rivers and small streams. Occasionally recorded in plantations adjacent to forest. Found at low elevations on Peninsular Malaysia , but has been recorded up to 1280 m on Borneo. Food and Feeding. Reported to feed on small vertebrates, invertebrates, eggs,fruits, and roots.

Percentage of food types from 105 scats collected in south Western Cape ( South Africa ): unidentified rodents (17%), Coleoptera (12%), green grass (12%), Orthoptera (10-56%), Rhabdomys pumilio (rodent, 5-5%), Otomys irroratus (rodent, 5:5%), dry grass (4-5%), seed (4-5%), unidentified bird (4:2%), unidentified snake (3-7%), terrestrial Gastropod (2:4%), Bitis arietans (snake, 2:1%), bird egg (1-3%), fish (1%), Bathyergus suillus (rodent, 1%), unidentified shrews (1%), Praomys verrauxi (rodent, 0-8%), felid (0-5%), unidentified lizard (0-5%), Mabuya species (0-5%), scorpion (0-5%), solifugid (0-5%), Cryptomys hottentotus (rodent, 0-3%), Myosorex varwus (0:3%), Chrysochloris asiatica (0-3%), Procavia capensis (0-3%), crab (0-3%), spider (0-:3%), millipede (0-3%), and freshwater Gastropod (0-3%). Percentage occurrence of food types from 19 stomachs collected in Zimbabwe : Muridae (63%), Aves (37%), Amphibia (16%), Reptilia (16%), and Insecta (16%). European Rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) form the staple prey in Spain , with lizards, insects (including beetles), birds ( Anas platyrhynchos ), rats ( Rattus rattus ) and tortoises ( Testudo graeca ) also recorded. Apparently resistant to snake venom (neurotoxins). Powerful digger. The name “Ichneumon” is thought to be derived from the Greek word for “tracker” in relation to their ability to find and dig out crocodile eggs. Adults kill small prey with a bite to the head, and large prey with a bite to the neck, eating from the head. Hunts alone, although in Spain , two or three individuals were observed simultaneously excavating rabbit breeding dens. Occasional food sharing of rabbit prey was also observed in Spain . Activity patterns. Mainly diurnal (in South Africa and Spain ), but some nocturnal activity recorded in South Africa , and a group studied in Israel was crepuscular (this may have been induced by vulnerability to dogs). A study of a Spanish population showed the activity budget to comprise 70% resting, 21% foraging, 6% eating, and 3% walking. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although occasionally seen in pairs and larger groups (up to five in Spain, including pups). Larger groups thought to be polygynous, made up of one male and several females (up to three in Israel ), with their pups. In Israel , individuals with access to a garbage dump formed territorial social groups, with four groups found occupying a total range of 3 km ®. In South Africa , home ranges varied from 0-30 to 0-45 km?®. In Spain, mean home range was 3-1 km? and density reached 2 individuals/km* (density negatively correlated with the presence of Iberian Lynx). The home range of a radio-collared male was elongated in shape, following the border of a marsh. Female home ranges overlapped substantially, but core areas were almost exclusive. Male home ranges showed minimal overlap, but tended to overlap numerous females’ home ranges ( one male overlapped four female ranges, another five females ). Home range size was correlated with body mass, negatively in females and positively in males. In Spain, male daily home range size averaged 2-3 times that of females, but there was no difference in male and female multi-day home range size. An adult male travelled from 0-6 to 6-4 km per day.

The anal gland secretion is composed of complex long-chain carboxylic acids. Sex-specific components differentiate male and female secretions. Seven distinct vocalizations have been described: a deep, sharp growling alarm call that elicits fleeing in other individuals; a short, repeated contact call given by individuals during foraging; a growl associated with defence of food, territory or mate; a bark or spit given during mating or fighting; and a short, sharp, vigorous pain call.

Underground dens (dug by European Rabbits or European Badgers), thickets and tree hollows, are used as nocturnal and day rest sites in Spain. Breeding. Sexual maturity is reached at over one year of age. During the breeding season, males increase frequency of contact with females. Mating occurs over two months in the spring. Females usually have only one litter per year but will produce a second litter if the first is lost or if the rodent population is high. Gestation lasts approximately 60 days. Litter size averages 2-7 in Spain and 3-3 (range = 1-4) in captivity, in Israel . The female reared the pups alone in Spain, but in Israel , group members shared babysitting. The pups’ eyes open at approximately 21 days. Weaning occurs between four to eight weeks. Pups are mobile at four weeks,first emerge around six weeks, and show first hunting behavior at ten weeks. In Israel , pups suckled from any breeding female in the group. Adults provision pups until they are a year old, when the young may disperse. In Spain, annual adult survival rate varied between 0-13 and 0-60. In Israel , only 3% of individuals survived to two years, with hunting and road kills accounting for 69% of mortality. The oldest known individual in captivity lived to over 20 years. Predators in Spain include the Iberian Lynx; domestic dogs kill mongooses in Israel .","Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List . Wide distribution suggests this speciesis unlikely to become threatened in the foreseeable future.

Percentage of food types from 105 scats collected in south Western Cape ( South Africa ): unidentified rodents (17%), Coleoptera (12%), green grass (12%), Orthoptera (10-56%), Rhabdomys pumilio (rodent, 5-5%), Otomys irroratus (rodent, 5:5%), dry grass (4-5%), seed (4-5%), unidentified bird (4:2%), unidentified snake (3-7%), terrestrial Gastropod (2:4%), Bitis arietans (snake, 2:1%), bird egg (1-3%), fish (1%), Bathyergus suillus (rodent, 1%), unidentified shrews (1%), Praomys verrauxi (rodent, 0-8%), felid (0-5%), unidentified lizard (0-5%), Mabuya species (0-5%), scorpion (0-5%), solifugid (0-5%), Cryptomys hottentotus (rodent, 0-3%), Myosorex varwus (0:3%), Chrysochloris asiatica (0-3%), Procavia capensis (0-3%), crab (0-3%), spider (0-:3%), millipede (0-3%), and freshwater Gastropod (0-3%). Percentage occurrence of food types from 19 stomachs collected in Zimbabwe : Muridae (63%), Aves (37%), Amphibia (16%), Reptilia (16%), and Insecta (16%). European Rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ) form the staple prey in Spain , with lizards, insects (including beetles), birds ( Anas platyrhynchos ), rats ( Rattus rattus ) and tortoises ( Testudo graeca ) also recorded. Apparently resistant to snake venom (neurotoxins). Powerful digger. The name “Ichneumon” is thought to be derived from the Greek word for “tracker” in relation to their ability to find and dig out crocodile eggs. Adults kill small prey with a bite to the head, and large prey with a bite to the neck, eating from the head. Hunts alone, although in Spain , two or three individuals were observed simultaneously excavating rabbit breeding dens. Occasional food sharing of rabbit prey was also observed in Spain . Activity patterns. Mainly diurnal (in South Africa and Spain ), but some nocturnal activity recorded in South Africa , and a group studied in Israel was crepuscular (this may have been induced by vulnerability to dogs). A study of a Spanish population showed the activity budget to comprise 70% resting, 21% foraging, 6% eating, and 3% walking. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although occasionally seen in pairs and larger groups (up to five in Spain, including pups). Larger groups thought to be polygynous, made up of one male and several females (up to three in Israel ), with their pups. In Israel , individuals with access to a garbage dump formed territorial social groups, with four groups found occupying a total range of 3 km ®. In South Africa , home ranges varied from 0-30 to 0-45 km?®. In Spain, mean home range was 3-1 km? and density reached 2 individuals/km* (density negatively correlated with the presence of Iberian Lynx). The home range of a radio-collared male was elongated in shape, following the border of a marsh. Female home ranges overlapped substantially, but core areas were almost exclusive. Male home ranges showed minimal overlap, but tended to overlap numerous females’ home ranges ( one male overlapped four female ranges, another five females ). Home range size was correlated with body mass, negatively in females and positively in males. In Spain, male daily home range size averaged 2-3 times that of females, but there was no difference in male and female multi-day home range size. An adult male travelled from 0-6 to 6-4 km per day. Latrines are used by all family members, and tend to be found near resting sites in preferred habitats. Individuals anal-mark stones along trails by squatting or anal dragging. The anal gland secretion is composed of complex long-chain carboxylic acids. Sex-specific components differentiate male and female secretions. Seven distinct vocalizations have been described: a deep, sharp growling alarm call that elicits fleeing in other individuals; a short, repeated contact call given by individuals during foraging; a growl associated with defence of food, territory or mate; a bark or spit given during mating or fighting; and a short, sharp, vigorous pain call. The pain call is the only vocalization made by solitary individuals. Underground dens (dug by European Rabbits or European Badgers), thickets and tree hollows, are used as nocturnal and day rest sites in Spain. Breeding. Sexual maturity is reached at over one year of age. During the breeding season, males increase frequency of contact with females. Mating occurs over two months in the spring. Females usually have only one litter per year but will produce a second litter if the first is lost or if the rodent population is high. Gestation lasts approximately 60 days. Litter size averages 2-7 in Spain and 3-3 (range = 1-4) in captivity, in Israel . The female reared the pups alone in Spain, but in Israel , group members shared babysitting. The pups’ eyes open at approximately 21 days. Weaning occurs between four to eight weeks. Pups are mobile at four weeks,first emerge around six weeks, and show first hunting behavior at ten weeks. In Israel , pups suckled from any breeding female in the group. Adults provision pups until they are a year old, when the young may disperse. In Spain, annual adult survival rate varied between 0-13 and 0-60. In Israel , only 3% of individuals survived to two years, with hunting and road kills accounting for 69% of mortality. The oldest known individual in captivity lived to over 20 years. Predators in Spain include the Iberian Lynx; domestic dogs kill mongooses in Israel . Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List . Wide distribution suggests this speciesis unlikely to become threatened in the foreseeable future. However dependence upon riparian habitats leaves them vulnerable to drainage and ground water extraction. Subject to predator control in Portugal , where it has recently increased its distribution northwards, and increased in local population densities (as in Spain ). The Egyptian Mongoose’s behavioral ecology is relatively well known from Spain , but is understudied in its native Africa. Bibliography. Angelici (2000), Bdolah et al .

Said to occur on Sumatra , but this is based only on two old museum specimens. Descriptive notes. Head-body 40-45. 5 cm , tail 25.8-30. 3 cm , hindfoot 8.2-9. 3 cm ; weight c. 3-4 kg. The coat color is reddish-brown, with fine yellow markings on the back. The lower parts of the legs are blackish-brown. The underside of the head and neck are yellowish; there is a whitish stripe on the side of the neck, from the ear to the shoulder; the color above the stripe is dark and is lighter below. Dorsal hairs are short (10-20 mm). The tail is yellowish and is more than 60% of the head and body length. The posterior chamber of the auditory bulla is less flat than in the Javan Mongoose and extends to well below the occipital condyle. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,P4/4.M2/2 = 40. Habitat. Primary rainforest, disturbed forest, and plantations. On Borneo, recorded from lowland areas up to 1200 m . Food and Feeding. Nothing known. Activity patterns. Appears to be manly diurnal, based on recent camera-trapping data. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Terrestrial. Appears to be solitary. Breeding. Nothing known. Status and Conservation. Classified as Data Deficient in The IUCN Red List . Virtually nothing is known about this species. Field studies and assessments of possible threats are urgently needed.

A fairly large mongoose, with long guard hairs (dorsal hairs are 40-50 mm long) and a white neck stripe. The coat color varies from gray to blackish-brown, with individual hairs ringed black and white. The chin is white, the throatis grayish, the chest is dark brown, and the belly is a lighter brown. The top of the head is pale grayish-brown, finely speckled with white. The muzzle is pale yellowish; the nose is flesh-colored with a deep vertical groove. The ears are short, broad, and rounded, and are covered with very short grayish hairs. The color ofthe iris varies from egg-yellow to deep brown. There is a white stripe that starts at the corner of the mouth and runs along the neck to the shoulder; the stripe is about 9-10 cm long and 8 mm wide at the base. The limbs are brown to black. The feet have shallow interdigital webs and strong claws; the naked sole on the hindfoot only extends about two-thirds the distance to the heel. The tail is bushy and tapering, and averages 63% the length of the head and body;it is the same color as the body, but becomes progressively ocherous (sometimes reddish) towards the tip. The anal glands on each side of the anus are about the size of a cherry and produce an aqueous fetid secretion (which can be squirted out with great force). There are three pairs of teats. The skull is large and heavy, but with relatively small crests. The posterior chamber of the auditory bulla is less flat than in the Javan Mongoose and extends to well below the occipital condyle. Mature individuals have a complete occipital bony orbit, although this may be incomplete in immature mongooses. Dental formula: 13/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40.

Descriptive notes. Head-body 51: 4 cm (males), 48-7 cm (females), tail 31-41 cm (males), 33-40 cm (females), hindfoot 11-11. 5 cm (males), 10.7-11. 8 cm (females), ear 3.4-5 cm (males), 3.2-3. 7 cm (females); weight 2.9-4 kg (males), 2:4—4-1 kg (females). Females are slightly smaller than males. The pelage is shaggy, grizzled dark reddish-brown to black, with white, red, or russet annulations on the guard hairs. The guard hairs are 3.2-5 cm long, longest at the rump; the underfur is 1.5-2. 5 cm long. Relatively broad head, small eyes with horizontal pupils, and broad, round ears. Hair long and thick in front of ears, protecting inner ear from water, but short around the mouth. A slit down the black rhinarium divides upper lip. Relatively long body with short legs. Tail approximately 66% of head-body length. The five-toes on each foot are unwebbed, enabling toes to spread. Feet have soft, naked pads and short, curved, non-retractible claws. Longest foreclaw about 11 mm . Hindfoot claws shorter and less curved. Plantar surfaces naked. There are two to three pairs of mammae. Convex baculum in male (c. 18 mm in adults). Cheek glands present. Broad skull: zygomatic breadth less than 50% condylobasal length. Supraoccipital crest is flange-like and meets well-developed sagittal crest (up to 4 mm high) to form T-shape. Brain case pear-shaped. Marked post-orbital constriction. Eye sockets small relative to skull length (20% of condylobasal length). Relatively short rostrum. Broad lowerjaw. Posterior ear bullae more prominent than anterior. Dental formula: 1 3/3, C 1/1, P 3-4/3-4, M 2/2 = 36-40. Upper jaw incisors larger than lower, outer incisors larger than inner for both jaws. Carnassials adapted to crushing rather than slicing. Heavy canines, upper possess blade-like processes on front and back, lower curved. Sharp canines and stout premolars and carnassials adapted to crushing shellfish. Habitat. Coincident with riparian habitats, such as swampy and streambed areas. In Dzanga-Sangha forest, Central African Republic ,restricted to swamp forest adjacent to streams. Also occurs in estuarine and marine habitats, as well as freshwater areas. Ranges farther from watercourses during dry periods. Found from sea level up to 2500 m . Food and Feeding. Opportunistic, with diet dependent upon prey availability. Marsh Mongooses are sympatric with Spotted-necked and African Clawless otters and there is some overlap in diet, but this species is less dependent upon aquatic prey. Prey composition differs between areas. In South Africa , the most frequent food types eaten varied across seven regions, but overall the frequency of prey types (as percentage composition in scats) was: Crustacea (23%), Insecta (17%), Mammalia (13%), Amphibia (9%), Mollusca (8%), and Aves (8%). In Zimbabwe , food types (as percentage of stomach contents) were: Amphibia (29%), Crustacea (24%), Mammalia (24%), Insecta (19%), and Pisces (5%). In the Central African Republic , the most abundant prey types (as frequency of occurrence in scats) from a rainforest study were: Coleoptera (86%), Amphibia (82%), Orthoptera (74%), and Crustacea (67%). Marsh Mongooses forage alongside or in shallow water. They are excellent swimmers, but do not swim readily. They reach into cracks, mud, and rocks with their forelimbs to search for prey, and stand up and use their forelimbs to throw hard-shelled prey items, e.g. crabs or mussels, downwards against rocks. Some prey, e.g. crabs, snakes, and large rodents, are seized in the jaws and flicked sideways prior to being given a killing bite. Small crabs are eaten whole; larger crabs are turned upside down, the foreclaws are bitten off, the meat eaten, and the carapace discarded. Upturned carapaces on riversides indicate the presence of Atilax (otters normally crunch up the crab carapace). Marsh Mongooses are extremely dexterous compared to other herpestids. They occasionally prey on poultry. Activity patterns. Crepuscular and nocturnal. Two studies, both in Natal ( South Africa ), produced conflicting results: one found them to forage mostly in the early morning and late afternoon, whereas the other (using telemetry) found them to be nocturnal. A telemetry study in Central African Republic found males to be crepuscular. Day beds are located on relatively high areas surrounded by deep mud or water. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although occasionally two are seen together. Home range sizes are generally linear in shape, due to fidelity to watercourses. One radio-collared adult male in the Central African Republic travelled up and down a stream around 5 km in length; its home range was estimated at 54 ha. In South Africa , the home range of a male was 131 ha and that of a female was 204 ha. The Central African Republic study showed that the male could spend up to seven days without visiting the edges ofhis territory, and documented a mean traveling speed of 21-4 m/s. Marsh Mongooses defaecate in latrines in exposed, open areas alongside streams. They may be territorial, communicating with conspecifics through sound, scent marking (with urine and anal and cheek glands), and with behavioral displays. Scats and anal gland secretions may be used in individual discrimination among adults; the response to marks made by the same and the opposite sex differ. May eject strong-smelling anal fluid when stressed. A variety of vocalizations have been noted, including bark-growl threats, excitement bleats, and moan/bleat vocalizations (which may fulfill a contact role). Breeding. In southern Africa, breeding is seasonal and occurs in the summer. Mating takes place from as early as August through to February. There is no evidence of a breeding season in West Africa. In captivity, estrus lasts approximately nine days, gestation is 69-80 days, litter size is two to three (mean ofsix litters: 2-5), and birth weight ranges from 78-125 g. Sex ratio at birth is unbiased. The young are born blind and softly furred (black). The eyes open at 9-14 days, and the young are weaned at 30-60 days. Two females in the wild carried one and two fetuses. Longevity in captivity is just over 19 years. Status and Conservation. Not CITES listed. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List . Pesticides have been found in scats, but not at dangerous concentrations. Widespread and relatively common and therefore unlikely to become threatened in the near future. However, continued destruction and conversion of swamplands to arable land is a concern. Also commonly occurs as bushmeat. Bibliography.

The smallest of the Asian mongooses, with a slender body and short legs. The coat color varies from buff to rufous or dark yellowishgray; the hairs have white and dark rings, giving a grizzled appearance. The muzzle is pointed, the rhinarium is blackish, the eyes are small with a brown iris, and the ears are short. The tail is muscular at the base and tapers throughoutits length. There are five digits on each foot, with long, sharp, non-retractile claws. The soles are naked. There is an anal pouch in which the ducts of the anal glands open laterally to the anus. The anal glands have a diameter of about 5 mm and a mean weight of 10 mg / 100 g of body weight. The secretion from these glands contains volatile fatty acids, with some differences between males and females. There are three pairs of teats. A claw-shaped baculum is present in the male and ranges in size from 5-15 mm. The skull is elongated and narrow, with a long brain case. The post-orbital bar encloses the orbit. The sagittal crest is weak, but the lambdoidal crest is developed. The posterior chamber of the auditory bulla is slightly inflated and projects no more than the anterior chamber. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2(3) = 40-42 (the presence of a third lower molar is rare). The canines are long and slightly recurved. The first premolars are small, and the other cheek teeth are well-developed and trenchant.","Forest, scrub, and open habitats. Also found close to human habitations. On Mauritius , a radio-tracking study found that this species favored woodland and scrub regions over other habitat types , and preferred riverine and dense forest at larger spatial scales.","Omnivorous. Most of the dietary information comes from introduced populations, but it is reported to eat rodents, snakes, insects, centipedes, and scorpionsin its native range. The diet appears to vary according to the season and the locality. Two specimen stomachs collected in the Rajasthan desert, India , contained remains of insects ( Helicopric bucephalus , Anthic sexguttata , Blap orientalus , Onthophagus longicornis , and Grylus sagillatus ) and a scorpion. In 56 stomachs from Puerto Rico , 315 food items were recorded, with the following frequency of occurrence: insects (56%), reptiles (17%), myriapods (12%), arachnids (8%), mammals (3%), crustaceans (1%), asteroids (starfish) (1%), amphibians (1%), and plants (11%). On St. Croix Island, 36 stomachs contained insects (83%), toads (14%), mice Mus musculus (14%), rats Rattus rattus (14%), crabs (11%), birds (3%), poultry (3%), lizards Anolis (0-5%), fruit (11%), and other plant material (6%). On Viti Levu, Fiji , an analysis of 4404 scats showed that the diet varied with the habitat: crabs were the main food in mangrove forests, rats in cane-fields, and cockroaches in urban areas. In Hawaii, a preponderance of cockroaches in the diet was reported. In the Caribbean, the Small Indian Mongoose was observed eating toads (including the parotid glands, which are normally noxious to predators), and the eggs and young of the hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) and leatherback turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea ). In Mauritius , 458 stomachs contained 46% rodents and shrews, 20% Tail-less Tenrecs ( Tenrec eucaudatus ), 20% invertebrates, 18% refuse, carrion and plants, 15% reptiles and amphibians, and 6% birds; there were seasonal changes in the diet, with more insects eaten during the wet season, and more reptiles taken during the dry season. During the winter on Korcula Island, Croatia , 184 food items were identified in 126 scats: the frequency of occurrence was 66% plants (mostly the fruits ofjuniper Juniperus oxycedrus and strawberry tree Arbutus unedo ), 38% mammals (mainly wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus and rats Rattus sp. ), 23% arthropods (mainly Coleoptera and a few Orthoptera), 14% birds (mostly passerines), and 1% reptiles. Compared to introduced populations in tropical areas, individuals on Korcula Island ate more fruits and less insects and reptiles. The killing method is efficient; the canines are driven into the brain and vertebral column of rodents, birds, and snakes. Centipedes and scorpions are bitten and repeatedly tossed before being consumed. Two individuals were reported working together to hunt crabs ( Metapograpsus messor ) in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; one turned over a stone, allowing the other to attack the crab. Individuals are reluctant to enter water more than a few centimetres deep. Activity patterns. Diurnal activity is reported from observations in India and Pakistan , and in regions where it has been introduced. In the Caribbean, most activity was between 10:00 h and 16:00 h, although they were seldom active on rainy days. Rest sites in Mauritius are mostly in fallen trees and holes in tree root systems. In India , they are reported to use burrows that they dig themselves. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Information mainly comes from introduced populations. While this species tends to be solitary, individuals frequently have been seen close to each other in introduced areas. Home ranges on St. Croix were 2-2 ha for females and 4-2 ha for males; home ranges overlapped both within and between sexes, but the overlap of core areas was minimal. On Oahu Island, Hawaii, the mean home range was 1-4 ha for seven females and 19-2 ha for five males (during the breeding season); the mean intra-sexual overlap of home ranges was 84% for males and 37% for females, with a large overlap between male and female ranges. Each male moved from den to den on successive nights and on some occasions two or three males shared a sleeping den. Females also moved den sites, except when they produced pups (they showed den fidelity during the 20 to 22 days after parturition). It appeared that males formed social coalitions, at least during the breeding season. The high population density in this introduced population suggested an abundance of resources, which may favor social behavior. Other studies report home range sizes of 22 to 39 ha in the Fiji Islands and 25 to 100 ha on Hawaii. On Puerto Rico , the home ranges of twenty mongooses were 3-2 to 19-4 ha. On Mauritius , the home ranges of 14 individuals were 25 ha to 110 ha, with considerable overlap between individuals. On two islands in Hawaii, both males and females showed natal dispersal in the fall, and males also dispersed during the breeding season. Population densities vary from less than ten to several hundred animals per km? The Small Indian Mongoose scent-marks using the secretions from its anal glands by wiping objects with its anal pouch. Males and females scent-mark their home range and are able to distinguish the scent marks of other individuals. This species has a large vocal repertoire of twelve distinct calls, which is unusually rich for an asocial species. The vocalizations are extremely varied and include weep, squawk, honk, ruck-a-ruck, pant, spit, bark, chuck, scream, and growl. Small Indian Mongooses can scratch and dig vigorously and have considerable manipulative dexterity. Gaits include walk, trot and gallop. They can climb, but are rarely observed far above the ground.",,"Diurnal activity is reported from observations in India and Pakistan , and in regions where it has been introduced.

Females also moved den sites, except when they produced pups (they showed den fidelity during the 20 to 22 days after parturition). It appeared that males formed social coalitions, at least during the breeding season. The high population density in this introduced population suggested an abundance of resources, which may favor social behavior. Other studies report home range sizes of 22 to 39 ha in the Fiji Islands and 25 to 100 ha on Hawaii. On Puerto Rico , the home ranges of twenty mongooses were 3-2 to 19-4 ha. On Mauritius , the home ranges of 14 individuals were 25 ha to 110 ha, with considerable overlap between individuals. On two islands in Hawaii, both males and females showed natal dispersal in the fall, and males also dispersed during the breeding season. Population densities vary from less than ten to several hundred animals per km? The Small Indian Mongoose scent-marks using the secretions from its anal glands by wiping objects with its anal pouch. Males and females scent-mark their home range and are able to distinguish the scent marks of other individuals. This species has a large vocal repertoire of twelve distinct calls, which is unusually rich for an asocial species. The vocalizations are extremely varied and include weep, squawk, honk, ruck-a-ruck, pant, spit, bark, chuck, scream, and growl. Small Indian Mongooses can scratch and dig vigorously and have considerable manipulative dexterity. Gaits include walk, trot and gallop. They can climb, but are rarely observed far above the ground. Breeding. Breeding data comes mainly from captive animals. Ovulation is induced by copulation. The estrous cycle is about three weeks, with estrus lasting three to four days. Gestation is approximately 49 days. The mean litter size is two and ranges from one to five. There are two to three litters a year. The timing of reproduction may be related to day length, as most pregnancies seem to occur prior to the summersolstice. In Mauritius , breeding is timed to avoid the driest times of the year. The beginning of estrus in captive females is revealed by restlessness and increased scent marking. Several males may attend a female, and they commonly scream, bark, and chase each other. Both sexes are polygamous and may copulate several times a day in the absence of estrus, and more frequently during estrus. Females in the late stage of pregnancy show antagonism toward males. Births occur at night, shortly after sunset. Nesting material is not used. Birth weight is about 21 g . Newborns are covered with light gray hairs, which are sparse on the abdomen. The incisors and the eruptive cones of the canines are visible, and the claws are well-developed. The eyes are closed and will open between 17 and 20 days. Mewling vocalizations are emitted when the young are disturbed. At two weeks, the incisors are fully in place and the canines have erupted. At 22 weeks, all the permanent teeth are in place. Two-thirds of the adult body massis attained at four months and sexual maturity is reached at one year. The first excursion out of the den occurs at about four weeks and the young follow the mother on hunting trips at six weeks. Spermatogenesis in the male begins when the weight reaches 400 g ; the baculum reaches adult size and mass at five months or when the weight reaches 500 g .","Listed on CITES Appendix III in India . Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List . Vulnerable in China . The Small Indian Mongoose is considered unthreatened in its native range as it occurs in many different types of habitats. However, these mongooses are often captured and sold as pets, and there is some commercial trade in China , India , and Nepal , which may constitute a threat in some parts ofits native range. This species has been introduced to several tropical oceanic islands for rodent control in plantations or to control vipers. Unfortunately, introduced populations have also preyed on the endemic fauna on some islands and may have caused the extinction of several species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. They eat the eggs and young of some endangered sea turtles and have also been identified as the vector of different diseases, notably rabies and leptospirosis. There have been mainly unsuccessful attempts to eliminate this species on several islands where they have been introduced. ., .","Allen (1911) | Baldwin (1954) | Baldwin et al .

Small Indian Mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus French: Mangouste tachetée / German: Goldstaubmungo / Spanish: Meloncillo chico Taxonomy. Mangusta auropunctata Hodgson, 1836 , central Nepal . Some authors considered the Small Indian Mongoose and the Javan Mongoose ( H . javanicus ) conspecific under the name H . javanicus or H . auropunctatus . Recent molecular studies suggest that they should be treated as separate species. Five subspecies have been recognized in H . auropunctatus , but the taxonomy needs clarification as some populations (notably from southern China ) have not been confirmed as belonging to this species or to H . javanicus . Included here is H . palustris , which has been considered either a separate species or a synonym of H . auropunctatus . Distribution. SW Asia from Iraq and Iran to Afghanistan , Pakistan , India , Nepal , and Bhutan ; also Bangladesh , Myanmar and S China (including Hainan I). Introduced to Antigua , Barbados , Beef Island, Buck Island, Carriacou, Croatia , Cuba , Fiji , French Guiana, Goat Island, Grenada , Guadeloupe, Guyana , Hawaii, Hispaniola, Jamaica , Japan , Jost Van Dyke, La Desirade, Lavango, Mafia ( Tanzania ), Marie Galante, Martinique, Maui, Mauritius , Molokai, Nevis , Oahu, Puerto Rico , St. Croix, St. John, St. Kitts , St. Lucia , St. Martin , St. Thomas, St. Vincent , Surinam , Tortola , Trinidad , Vieques, and Water Island. Introduction was unsuccessful in the Dominican Republic. The Small Indian Mongoose or the Javan Mongoose is said to occur on Hong Kong since the 1980s, and to have been also introduced to some Indonesian islands (particularly Ambon ). Descriptive notes. Head-body 25-37 cm, tail 19.2-29 cm; weight 305-662 g. There is sexual dimorphism, males being larger than females (particularly in introduced populations), for example on St Croix Island (Caribbean): Head-body 22-2—-44-6 cm (males), 21.4-38. 5 cm (females). The smallest of the Asian mongooses, with a slender body and short legs. The coat color varies from buff to rufous or dark yellowishgray; the hairs have white and dark rings, giving a grizzled appearance. The muzzle is pointed, the rhinarium is blackish, the eyes are small with a brown iris, and the ears are short. The tail is muscular at the base and tapers throughoutits length. There are five digits on each foot, with long, sharp, non-retractile claws. The soles are naked. There is an anal pouch in which the ducts of the anal glands open laterally to the anus. The anal glands have a diameter of about 5 mm and a mean weight of 10 mg / 100 g of body weight. The secretion from these glands contains volatile fatty acids, with some differences between males and females. There are three pairs of teats. A claw-shaped baculum is present in the male and ranges in size from 5-15 mm. The skull is elongated and narrow, with a long brain case. The post-orbital bar encloses the orbit. The sagittal crest is weak, but the lambdoidal crest is developed. The posterior chamber of the auditory bulla is slightly inflated and projects no more than the anterior chamber. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2(3) = 40-42 (the presence of a third lower molar is rare). The canines are long and slightly recurved. The first premolars are small, and the other cheek teeth are well-developed and trenchant. Habitat. Forest, scrub, and open habitats. Also found close to human habitations. On Mauritius , a radio-tracking study found that this species favored woodland and scrub regions over other habitat types , and preferred riverine and dense forest at larger spatial scales. Food and Feeding. Omnivorous. Most of the dietary information comes from introduced populations, but it is reported to eat rodents, snakes, insects, centipedes, and scorpionsin its native range. The diet appears to vary according to the season and the locality. Two specimen stomachs collected in the Rajasthan desert, India , contained remains of insects ( Helicopric bucephalus , Anthic sexguttata , Blap orientalus , Onthophagus longicornis , and Grylus sagillatus ) and a scorpion. In 56 stomachs from Puerto Rico , 315 food items were recorded, with the following frequency of occurrence: insects (56%), reptiles (17%), myriapods (12%), arachnids (8%), mammals (3%), crustaceans (1%), asteroids (starfish) (1%), amphibians (1%), and plants (11%). On St. Croix Island, 36 stomachs contained insects (83%), toads (14%), mice Mus musculus (14%), rats Rattus rattus (14%), crabs (11%), birds (3%), poultry (3%), lizards Anolis (0-5%), fruit (11%), and other plant material (6%). On Viti Levu, Fiji , an analysis of 4404 scats showed that the diet varied with the habitat: crabs were the main food in mangrove forests, rats in cane-fields, and cockroaches in urban areas. In Hawaii, a preponderance of cockroaches in the diet was reported. In the Caribbean, the Small Indian Mongoose was observed eating toads (including the parotid glands, which are normally noxious to predators), and the eggs and young of the hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys imbricata ) and leatherback turtle ( Dermochelys coriacea ). In Mauritius , 458 stomachs contained 46% rodents and shrews, 20% Tail-less Tenrecs ( Tenrec eucaudatus ), 20% invertebrates, 18% refuse, carrion and plants, 15% reptiles and amphibians, and 6% birds; there were seasonal changes in the diet, with more insects eaten during the wet season, and more reptiles taken during the dry season. During the winter on Korcula Island, Croatia , 184 food items were identified in 126 scats: the frequency of occurrence was 66% plants (mostly the fruits ofjuniper Juniperus oxycedrus and strawberry tree Arbutus unedo ), 38% mammals (mainly wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus and rats Rattus sp. ), 23% arthropods (mainly Coleoptera and a few Orthoptera), 14% birds (mostly passerines), and 1% reptiles. Compared to introduced populations in tropical areas, individuals on Korcula Island ate more fruits and less insects and reptiles. The killing method is efficient; the canines are driven into the brain and vertebral column of rodents, birds, and snakes. Centipedes and scorpions are bitten and repeatedly tossed before being consumed. Two individuals were reported working together to hunt crabs ( Metapograpsus messor ) in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; one turned over a stone, allowing the other to attack the crab. Individuals are reluctant to enter water more than a few centimetres deep. Activity patterns. Diurnal activity is reported from observations in India and Pakistan , and in regions where it has been introduced. In the Caribbean, most activity was between 10:00 h and 16:00 h, although they were seldom active on rainy days. Rest sites in Mauritius are mostly in fallen trees and holes in tree root systems. In India , they are reported to use burrows that they dig themselves. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Information mainly comes from introduced populations. While this species tends to be solitary, individuals frequently have been seen close to each other in introduced areas. Home ranges on St. Croix were 2-2 ha for females and 4-2 ha for males; home ranges overlapped both within and between sexes, but the overlap of core areas was minimal. On Oahu Island, Hawaii, the mean home range was 1-4 ha for seven females and 19-2 ha for five males (during the breeding season); the mean intra-sexual overlap of home ranges was 84% for males and 37% for females, with a large overlap between male and female ranges. Each male moved from den to den on successive nights and on some occasions two or three males shared a sleeping den. Females also moved den sites, except when they produced pups (they showed den fidelity during the 20 to 22 days after parturition). It appeared that males formed social coalitions, at least during the breeding season. The high population density in this introduced population suggested an abundance of resources, which may favor social behavior. Other studies report home range sizes of 22 to 39 ha in the Fiji Islands and 25 to 100 ha on Hawaii. On Puerto Rico , the home ranges of twenty mongooses were 3-2 to 19-4 ha. On Mauritius , the home ranges of 14 individuals were 25 ha to 110 ha, with considerable overlap between individuals. On two islands in Hawaii, both males and females showed natal dispersal in the fall, and males also dispersed during the breeding season. Population densities vary from less than ten to several hundred animals per km? The Small Indian Mongoose scent-marks using the secretions from its anal glands by wiping objects with its anal pouch. Males and females scent-mark their home range and are able to distinguish the scent marks of other individuals. This species has a large vocal repertoire of twelve distinct calls, which is unusually rich for an asocial species. The vocalizations are extremely varied and include weep, squawk, honk, ruck-a-ruck, pant, spit, bark, chuck, scream, and growl.

Common Dwarf Mongooses move as a group, but individuals spread out to forage while the group is moving. Examination of 160 scats from Natal ( South Africa ), found the following frequency of occurrence of food types : Coleoptera (79%), Orthoptera (64%), Myriapoda (34%), Arachnida (21%), Seeds (12%), Isoptera (8%), Hemiptera (8%), Lepidoptera (4%), and Mammalia (1%). Frequency of occurrence of food types in 27 stomachs collected from the northern area of southern Africa: Insecta (undetermined) (44%), Coleoptera adults (37%) and grubs (33%), Orthoptera (33%), Isoptera (33%), Araneae (11%), Muridae (4%), Myriapoda (4%), Reptilia (4%), Scorpiones (4%), and Solifugae (4%). Observed to crack crested francolin ( Francolinus sephaena ) eggs by grasping the eggs in their forelimbs and throwing them backwards through the hindlimbs onto a rock or other hard surface. Small vertebrates (e.g. mice or snakes) are killed with a bite through the back of the head. Large insects are generally eaten starting with the head. Activity patterns. Diurnal.

Their repertoire of behaviors includes foraging, resting, vigilance (including standing upright), self and allogrooming, social play, scent marking, and vocalization. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Lives in cohesive groups. Group size averages 8-9 (range = 2-21) in the Serengeti ( Tanzania ), and 12-3 (range = 2-32) in the Taru Desert ( Kenya ). Group members forage and sleep together, and share a home range. Termite mounds ( Macrotermes and Odontotermes species) and rock crevices are commonly used as subterranean dens for sleeping at night and for shade and protection during the day. Up to 200 termitaria are available within a territory, and groups favor areas with high termitaria density. Groups generally occupy a different den every night, but use a den for longer periods when babysitting pups. Mean home range size varies from 0-27 to 0-96 km? and mean population density ranges from 3-9 to 30-9 individuals/km?®. Daily foraging distances of up to 1 km have been recorded. Larger groups travel farther than smaller groups, but reduce foraging distance when travelling with small pups. Home ranges are defended. When two groups meet, the smaller group will generally retreat, without any physical aggression, but skirmishes can occur. Groups are highly social, with heterosexual mutual grooming common. Groups contain adult males and females and young of the dominant breeding pair. There is no consistent sex ratio bias amongst adults or pups. Intragroup aggression is rare, but there is an age-related dominance hierarchy in males and females. The dominant female dominates all other group members in access to food and frequency of anal marking, and can displace others from a foraging site. The male dominance hierarchy becomes obvious during estrus, when males compete for access to females. Subordinates exhibit a submissive crouching stance on approach of a dominant. Group members cooperate in rearing young, repelling predators, and rescuing group members from predators. They communicate vocally. Short nasal “peeps”, emitted every few seconds, serve to maintain group cohesion while foraging. Lead or “moving out” calls, given by the dominant female,elicit the group to follow. Shrill “tsiii” war cries are used to alert group members to a rival group and makes the group bunch and charge; a standard deployment has the dominant male leading and the dominant female at the rear. Alarm calls convey information on predator type and urgency. Repeated “tchee” alarm calls warn the group of a predator, and a close approach of a predator is signalled with an alarm “chitter”, as they run to cover. Alarm calls are shorter and higher in pitch, the more immediate the danger.

This marking is often done communally, particularly after intergroup encounters. Male anal gland secretions contain vitamin E (absent in female secretions), suggesting they play a sex-specific role. Breeding. In seasonal climates, births are restricted to the wetter months, which is likely to be correlated with invertebrate prey availability. Dominant females can produce up to four litters per year. The age offirst conception for femalesis rarely under two years. Estrus in a group is synchronized and occurs for one to seven days. Estrus can occur within two to four weeks of parturition, enabling females to conceive and gestate while suckling the current litter of pups. During estrus, males compete for access to females and females solicit copulation from males. Early in the dominant female’s estrous cycle, the dominant male guards her, maintaining exclusive proximity and copulation access and aggressively repelling subordinate males, who attempt to sneak copulations. Later in estrus, the dominant male will mate with subordinate females. The dominant female then mates other males. Almost all individuals mate, virtually everyday during estrus. However, in spite of the fact that all group members copulate, the Common Dwarf Mongoose is a classic example of a species exhibiting a despotic social system of high reproductive skew: dominant females produce 73% of all litters, despite being outnumbered by subordinates 1:2. Subordinate reproduction is suppressed both behaviorally and hormonally. There is no evidence of inbreeding avoidance; individuals mate randomly without regard to relatedness, even though most males and females within groups are usually closely related. The gestation period is approximately seven weeks. Litter size varies from two to six, with two to three being the most common. When subordinate females do breed, they are usually synchronized with the dominant female, giving birth on the same day. Most offspring born to subordinate females fail to survive, probably due to infanticide by the dominant female. Following birth of the communal litter, pups are kept in the subterranean den until they are approximately three to four weeks old. During this period, one or more individuals (usually subordinate females) will remain at the den to “babysit” the pups while the group forages (the babysitter changes daily). These babysitters guard the communal litter from predators and groom and warm the pups. Some subordinate females nurse the dominant female’s pups without giving birth themselves, lactating due to a physiological pseudopregnancy. Weaning occurs around 40-45 days. When the pups emerge from the den and begin accompanying the foraging group, adults provide care by carrying, grooming, guarding, and provisioning pups. Subordinates (mainly females) usually provide more care than the parents. Pups beg for food from adults. Provisioning involves carrying food to young and dropping or leaving whole or partial prey items. There appears to be an escort system, where each pup forms a one-to-one association with an adult (its escort) that it closely follows and who feeds it, similar to the system seen in the Banded Mongoose. Pup survival is higher in groups with more helpers, principally because efficient vigilance reduces predation (of both adults and pups). With its small bodysize, open habitat, and diurnal lifestyle the Common Dwarf Mongoose is vulnerable to a variety of predators. Annual survival rate of emergent pups is 0-41 and adult annual survival rate is between 0-68 and 0-74. Pup predation is likely driven by snakes (e.g. cobra), monitor lizards, larger mongoose species (Banded Mongoose and Egyptian Mongoose), and raptors, in particular the eastern chantinggoshawk ( Melierax poliopterus ) and brown snake eagle ( Circaetus cinerus ). Predation is 260% higher in smaller groups, with guards suffering the highest predation rate. In the wild, males can live up to ten years and females 14 years. In captivity, an individual is recorded to have lived for over twelve years. Invalid care has been recorded, where the group remains in proximity to and provisions a sick or injured adult. Males and females commonly transfer between groups voluntarily or via takeovers. Females are more likely to remain in their natal group than males. Voluntary dispersers are usually young adults, who increase their probability of attaining a dominant breeding position via emigration. Single-sex and mixed-sex transient groups also occur. In contrast to the Banded Mongoose and Meerkat, emigration from groups does not appear to involve intra-group aggression (excluding takeovers).",Not CITES listed.

Human garbage dumps also utilized. Banded Mongooses move as a group, but individuals forage independently within the moving group. Individuals generally walk, sniffing and scraping at the ground, and often stop and dig intensively for prey. Dung of large herbivores (especially African Elephant, Loxodonta africana ) is popular for foraging, due to the relatively high density of beetles. Individuals often crack hard-shelled prey (e.g. dung beetle, pill millipede, or egg) by holding it in their front paws, whilst balancing on their hindlimbs, and throwing it between the hindlegs onto a rock or other hard surface. Prey and foraging sites such as holes, scrapes, and dung are generally defended from conspecifics, except for adults provisioning or sharing food with young pups. There is a report of a group stealing food regurgitated by a pair of Black-backed Jackal for their pups. Activity patterns. Diurnal. Groups sleep together in subterranean dens, emerging in early morning and returning before sunset. During the day the group forages together, usually resting in a shady area around midday. The behavioral repertoire includes foraging, resting, vigilance (including standing on the hindlegs), self and allogrooming, social play, scent marking, and vocalizing. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Banded Mongooseslive in cohesive groups, which share a home range. In Uganda (Queen Elizabeth National Park), mean group size is 15 individuals (range = 9-28), mean home range size is 0-9 km* (range = 0-6-2), mean population density is 18 individuals/km?* (range = 7-36), and daily foraging distances are 2-3 km. In Tanzania (Serengeti), mean group size is 15 (range = 4-29), mean population density is two individuals/km?, and daily foraging distances are up to 10 km . A group size of 41 was recorded in Somalia , and 75 from South Africa (Kruger National Park). Group size, home range size, population density, and daily foraging distances depend upon habitat type and food density, and therefore vary geographically. Groups have up to 40 dens within their home range. They generally occupy a different den every few days, but use a den for longer periods when babysitting pups. Concentrated food sources (e.g. garbage dumps) can support larger groups and smaller core areas within the home range. Home ranges are defended. A smaller group will generally retreat, without physical aggression, but skirmishes can occur and individuals have been killed during such encounters. Groups respond more intensely to scats of neighboring groups than to scats from more distant groups, suggesting that neighbors pose a greater threat. Groups are highly social. Grooming and marking maintain group bonds. Groups contain adult males and females and their young. The adult sex ratio is male-biased. Within a group, males are closely related and females are closely related, but the breeding adults are not related to each other. There is generally little evidence of a dominance hierarchy. However, a male dominance hierarchy becomes obvious during estrus, when males compete for access to females. Aggression over food items is usually settled in favor of the owner. Group members cooperate in rearing young and repelling predators; one group was seen rescuing a member from the talons of a martial eagle. One case of invalid care has been reported. Group members communicate vocally. Contact calls, emitted every few seconds, serve to maintain group cohesion while foraging. “Lead” calls are used by individuals to elicit the group to follow them; “pup-follow” calls encourage pups to follow the adults. Shrill chirruping “war” cries alert group members to a rival group and encourage them to charge at the invaders. Growls and spits are used to defend resources if another group member approaches. Short, sharp alarm calls elicit rapid evasive behavior; “worry” calls warn group members of lower-intensity danger. A “lost” call indicates distress when an individualis separated from the group. Individuals also respond to the alarm calls of other species, in particular plover ( Vanellus spp.). Olfactory communication is also used in intraand inter-group communication. Group members scent-mark each other and objects (e.g. rocks), by wiping them with the anal gland. This marking is often done communally, with all group members involved in an orgy of scent marking. Urine and feces are also apparently used in communication, with individuals overmarking excretion sites. An olfactory “signal” from another group often elicits an excited and aggressive response. In addition to allogrooming, Banded Mongooses in Uganda and Masai Mara, Kenya , have been seen grooming Common Warthogs ( Phacochoerus africanus ); they are probably removing ectoparasites, which they eat.",,"Diurnal.

Breeding. In seasonal climates, births are restricted to the wetter months (presumably correlated with invertebrate prey availability). Females in dry regions have one or two litters a year; females in wetter equatorial regions can have up to five. The age at which females first reproduceis also geographically variable, recorded at two years in the Serengeti and under one year in Uganda (the earliest record being just over eight months). Estrus can occur within six days of parturition, enabling females to conceive and gestate while suckling the current litter of pups. This minimizes the interbirth interval, so females can produce four or even five litters per year. During estrus, males compete for access to females. Dominant males guard females and aggressively repel subordinate males who attempt to sneak copulations. There is no sign of female competition for access to males. However, there is a hierarchy in mate-guarding, with older females mate-guarded first, and younger females mate-guarded later. Each female is guarded for two to three days. Females may escape their mate-guard and mate with other males within and outside their group. The overall result is that most males and females copulate with numerous partners. About 75% of the females in a group give birth. Gestation lasts approximately nine weeks. Mean litter size is 3-2 (range = 1-6). Litter size and fetus size are smaller in younger, smaller females. Abortion and miscarriage are rare. Banded Mongooses are truly communal breeders, with up to ten females in a group giving birth, often on the same day, in the same den (there is rarely more than a few days between births). Such birth synchrony may reduce infanticide by reducing the ability of males and females to discriminate between offspring. Although infanticide occurs, it appears to be a rare event. Alternatively, synchronous parturition may be a strategy to economize pup care, by enabling communal care of the young for a minimal period. A female may either abort her litter or give birth to it over different days—an extremely unusual behavior for a mammal. Birth weight of pups is 20-50 g. Pups are born blind and with short fur. Their eyes open at around ten days. The sex ratio of pups at emergence from the den is male-biased. Pupsstay in the subterranean den until they are weaned, at around three to four weeks of age. During this period, one or more individuals will remain at the den to “babysit” the pups while the group forages. The babysitter usually changes every day. These babysitters guard the communal litter against predators. On the rare occasions when pups are observed out of the den during this period, pups suckle from numerous females. When the pups emerge from the den and begin accompanying the foraging group, adults provide care by carrying, grooming, playing with, and provisioning pups. Provisioning involves dropping or leaving whole or partial prey items. Adults also provide protection: pups shelter under the belly of the nearest adult when frightened. Most pups have an adult escort, who cares forit for four to eight weeks; this escort is unlikely to be the pup’s parent. The pup closely followsits escort, fending off other pups, and begging for the food items the escort provides. Pups that associate most often with an escort are more likely to survive. Males generally do more babysitting and escorting than females. Due to their relatively small body size, open habitat, and diurnallifestyle, pups and adults are vulnerable to a wide array of predators. In Uganda , pup mortality is high, with 20% of litters failing completely within the first month. Only 18% of pups are estimated to survive from birth to independence. Adult survival is substantially higher (annual survival rate 0-86). Comparable annual survival rates from Serengeti are 0-46 for pups and between 0-65 and 0-69 for adults. Pups are heavily preyed upon by marabous ( Leptoptilus crumeniferus ) and Nile monitors ( Varanus niloticus ); predators on adults include snakes (especially the rock python Python sebae ), mammalian carnivores (e.g. Leopards) and raptors (e.g. martial eagle). Dispersal can occur via forced eviction of single-sex sub-groups by group members or via voluntary emigration (also of single-sex sub-groups). Dispersers are usually young adults. There is no clear sex bias to dispersal, although females appear to be evicted and males appear to voluntarily emigrate more often. Banded Mongooses can live to over ten years in the wild, and twelve years in captivity.","Not CITES listed. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List .

Viverra mungo Gmelin, 1788 , origin uncertain (later attributed to Gambia , but subsequently suggested to be Cape Province , South Africa ). Up to fifteen subspecies have been named, but a revision is needed. Distribution. Senegal and Gambia E to Eritrea and Somalia and then SW to PR Congo , Angola , and NE Namibia , and S to E South Africa . Descriptive notes. Head-body 30-40 cm (males), 33-38. 5 cm (females), tail 17.8-31 cm (males), 19-245 cm (females), hindfoot 5.3-9 cm (males), 5.3-8. 4 cm (females), ear 2.1-3. 6 cm (males), 2.2-7 cm (females); weight 0-89.1-88 kg (males), 0-99.1-74 kg (females). No obvious sexual dimorphism. Medium-sized; body covered with coarse hair. Coat color varies geographically from whitish-gray to dark brown, with 10-15 dark bands across the back from the shoulders to the base of the tail. The guard hairs are short on the head ( 6 mm ), lengthen toward the rump ( 45 mm in eastern specimens, 35 mm in western specimens), and are shorter on the tail. The individual guard coat hairs are light-colored at the base, with two broad black bands interspersed with light bands and a narrow dark tip. In reddish-brown mongooses, the lighter-colored bands are red-brown. The underfuris fine and short, with a dark base and light tip; there is apparently no undercoat on the rear. Long head with a pointed muzzle. Rhinarium short and lacks split. Ears small and rounded. Five digits on foreand hindfeet; hallux and pollex reduced. Front claws are elongated ( 20 mm —exceptfirst digit, which is 8 mm ) and strong for digging. Hindclaws shorter ( 14 mm ) and less curved than front claws. Three pairs of mammae. Pear-shaped braincase. Postorbital bars incomplete. Zygomatic arches thin. Short, broad rostrum. Supraoccipital crest not well-developed (less than 1-5 mm high). No sagittal crest. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 3/3, M 2/2 = 36. Sharp strong teeth, especially canines. Outer incisors larger than inner. Upper canines slightly recurved. Lower canines distinctly recurved. Cheek teeth possess low, rounded cusps. Carnassials adapted to crushing, not slicing. Habitat. Found in a wide range of habitats, principally in savannah and woodland. Also seen in towns and villages. Absent from desert, semi-desert, and montane regions. Preferentially use termitaria as dens; otherwise dens are sited in gulleys or thickets. Dens have multiple entrances and chambers. Food and Feeding. Insectivorous diet, especially Coleoptera (beetles) and Myriapoda (centipedes) larvae. Occasionally vertebrates (including eggs, mice, rats, frogs,lizards, and small snakes) are consumed. Frequency of occurrence of food types in 120 scats from Uganda : Diplopoda (96%), Coleoptera (88%), Formicidae adults (69%) and pupae (23%), Gryllidae (44%), Isoptera (33%), Dermaptera (23%), larvae (unidentified) (20%), Blattidae (13%), Acrididae (10%), Acarina (8%), pupae (unidentified) (7%), Hemiptera (6%), Tettigoniidae (5%), Lepidoptera (2%), Araneae (3%), and Gastropoda (2%). Frequency of occurrence of food types in 113 scats from Natal ( South Africa ): Myriapoda (70%), Coleoptera (92%), Orthoptera (57%), Isoptera (33%), Hemiptera (29%), Arachnida (21%), Seeds (20%), Mammalia (7%), Lepidoptera (7%), and Blattodea (5%). Frequency of occurrence of food types in 14 stomachs from Zimbabwe and Botswana : Insecta (71%), Reptilia (43%), fruits (36%), Amphibia (7%), Araneae (7%), Myriapoda (7%), Scorpiones (7%), and Solifugae (7%). Human garbage dumps also utilized. Banded Mongooses move as a group, but individuals forage independently within the moving group. Individuals generally walk, sniffing and scraping at the ground, and often stop and dig intensively for prey. Dung of large herbivores (especially African Elephant, Loxodonta africana ) is popular for foraging, due to the relatively high density of beetles. Individuals often crack hard-shelled prey (e.g. dung beetle, pill millipede, or egg) by holding it in their front paws, whilst balancing on their hindlimbs, and throwing it between the hindlegs onto a rock or other hard surface. Prey and foraging sites such as holes, scrapes, and dung are generally defended from conspecifics, except for adults provisioning or sharing food with young pups. There is a report of a group stealing food regurgitated by a pair of Black-backed Jackal for their pups. Activity patterns. Diurnal. Groups sleep together in subterranean dens, emerging in early morning and returning before sunset. During the day the group forages together, usually resting in a shady area around midday. The behavioral repertoire includes foraging, resting, vigilance (including standing on the hindlegs), self and allogrooming, social play, scent marking, and vocalizing. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Banded Mongooseslive in cohesive groups, which share a home range. In Uganda (Queen Elizabeth National Park), mean group size is 15 individuals (range = 9-28), mean home range size is 0-9 km* (range = 0-6-2), mean population density is 18 individuals/km?* (range = 7-36), and daily foraging distances are 2-3 km. In Tanzania (Serengeti), mean group size is 15 (range = 4-29), mean population density is two individuals/km?, and daily foraging distances are up to 10 km . A group size of 41 was recorded in Somalia , and 75 from South Africa (Kruger National Park). Group size, home range size, population density, and daily foraging distances depend upon habitat type and food density, and therefore vary geographically. Groups have up to 40 dens within their home range. They generally occupy a different den every few days, but use a den for longer periods when babysitting pups. Concentrated food sources (e.g. garbage dumps) can support larger groups and smaller core areas within the home range. Home ranges are defended. A smaller group will generally retreat, without physical aggression, but skirmishes can occur and individuals have been killed during such encounters. Groups respond more intensely to scats of neighboring groups than to scats from more distant groups, suggesting that neighbors pose a greater threat. Groups are highly social. Grooming and marking maintain group bonds. Groups contain adult males and females and their young. The adult sex ratio is male-biased. Within a group, males are closely related and females are closely related, but the breeding adults are not related to each other. There is generally little evidence of a dominance hierarchy. However, a male dominance hierarchy becomes obvious during estrus, when males compete for access to females. Aggression over food items is usually settled in favor of the owner. Group members cooperate in rearing young and repelling predators; one group was seen rescuing a member from the talons of a martial eagle. One case of invalid care has been reported. Group members communicate vocally. Contact calls, emitted every few seconds, serve to maintain group cohesion while foraging. “Lead” calls are used by individuals to elicit the group to follow them; “pup-follow” calls encourage pups to follow the adults. Shrill chirruping “war” cries alert group members to a rival group and encourage them to charge at the invaders. Growls and spits are used to defend resources if another group member approaches. Short, sharp alarm calls elicit rapid evasive behavior; “worry” calls warn group members of lower-intensity danger. A “lost” call indicates distress when an individualis separated from the group. Individuals also respond to the alarm calls of other species, in particular plover ( Vanellus spp.). Olfactory communication is also used in intraand inter-group communication. Group members scent-mark each other and objects (e.g. rocks), by wiping them with the anal gland. This marking is often done communally, with all group members involved in an orgy of scent marking. Urine and feces are also apparently used in communication, with individuals overmarking excretion sites. An olfactory “signal” from another group often elicits an excited and aggressive response. In addition to allogrooming, Banded Mongooses in Uganda and Masai Mara, Kenya , have been seen grooming Common Warthogs ( Phacochoerus africanus ); they are probably removing ectoparasites, which they eat. Breeding. In seasonal climates, births are restricted to the wetter months (presumably correlated with invertebrate prey availability). Females in dry regions have one or two litters a year; females in wetter equatorial regions can have up to five. The age at which females first reproduceis also geographically variable, recorded at two years in the Serengeti and under one year in Uganda (the earliest record being just over eight months). Estrus can occur within six days of parturition, enabling females to conceive and gestate while suckling the current litter of pups. This minimizes the interbirth interval, so females can produce four or even five litters per year. During estrus, males compete for access to females. Dominant males guard females and aggressively repel subordinate males who attempt to sneak copulations. There is no sign of female competition for access to males. However, there is a hierarchy in mate-guarding, with older females mate-guarded first, and younger females mate-guarded later. Each female is guarded for two to three days. Females may escape their mate-guard and mate with other males within and outside their group. The overall result is that most males and females copulate with numerous partners. About 75% of the females in a group give birth. Gestation lasts approximately nine weeks. Mean litter size is 3-2 (range = 1-6). Litter size and fetus size are smaller in younger, smaller females.

Females become significantly larger and heavier upon assuming dominantstatus, averaging 750 g ; nondominant females average 710 g . The Meerkat is a small mongoose, with a relatively large pointed muzzle. It has coarse, pale-gray, tan, orsilvery-brown fur, with dark transverse bands across the back, and black eye patches. The underparts are paler than the dorsum; the coat color is darker in the southern part of the species’ range. The fur on the tail is short, sparse on the underside, and yellowish with a black tip. The guard hairs are 15 mm at shoulder, increasing to 30-40 mm at the rump, decreasing to 20 mm at base of the tail and tapering to 12 mm attail tip. The dorsal guard hairs are light at the base, have two dark rings separated by a light band, and a silvery tip. The small, rounded ears can close to keep dust out while the animal digs: the posterior and superior ear ridges move forward and down. The tail is slender, not bushy, and the legs are thin. The muscular forelimbs have four digits, each with long claws ( 15 mm ). The hindfeet also have four digits, with shorter claws ( 8 mm ). The feet are naked to the wrist/ankle. There are three pairs of mammae. Meerkats lack cheek glands. The skull is high, broad, and rounded. Hindchambers of ear bullae larger relative to anterior. Closed orbital space. Relatively large eye sockets (more than 20% total skull length). Supra-orbital crest represented by low ridge. Saggital crest not present. Light zygomatic arches. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1/,P 3/3, M 2/2 = 36. Outer upper incisors larger than other incisors. Upper canines straight,slightly flattened on inside. Lower canines distinctly recurved. Broad molars with sharp cusps. Poorly developed carnassial shear adapted for insectivory.","Open semi-arid areas, scrub, rangeland, and grassland. Subterranean dens are used, which tend to be extensive, with multiple entrances and chambers. The temperatures within dens are more stable and comfortable than the hot and cold extremes on the surface. Meerkats are good diggers, and are likely to excavate some dens themselves, but usually occupy dens dug by other small mammals. Dens may be shared with South African Ground Squirrels or Yellow Mongooses.","Insectivorous diet, especially Coleoptera (beetles), Arachnids (scorpions and spiders), and Myriapoda (centipedes) larvae. Occasionally vertebrates (including lizards and small snakes) are consumed. Frequency of occurrence of food types from 23 stomachs collected from Botswana : Coleoptera larvae (91%), Scorpiones (35%), Coleoptera adults (17%), Orthoptera (17%), Myriapoda (13%), Reptilia (13%), and Isoptera (9%). Frequency of occurrence of prey items in 98 stomachs collected from Orange Free State ( South Africa ): Coleoptera (58%), Lepidoptera (pupae and larvae) (43%), Isoptera (40%), Orthoptera (34%), Diptera (pupae, larvae) (23%), Arachnida (21%), Hymenoptera (15%), Dermaptera (12%), Chilopoda (10%), Dictyoptera (10%), Diplopoda (9%), Amphibia (5%), Reptilia (5%), Aves (2%), and Hemiptera (1%). Meerkats move as a loose group, with individuals foraging independently. Individuals generally walk, sniffing and scraping at the ground surface, and often stop and dig intensively for prey—sometimes disappearing from view in the deep hole they have dug. Potential food items, foraging holes and scrapes, are generally defended from approach by others, except for adults sharing food with young pups. Activity patterns. Diurnal. A group sleeps together overnight in a subterranean den, emerging in early morning and returning before sunset. During the day the group forages together, usually resting in a shady area around midday. They usually start the day by sunbathing at the den and end the day relaxing by the den. Their behavioral repertoire includes foraging, resting, vigilance (including standing erect), self and allogrooming, social play, scent marking, and vocalization. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Meerkats live in social groups that share a home range, which theyjointly defend. Mean group size is 4-2 to 8:5 individuals (range = 3-20), with up to 49 recorded. Mean home range size is 5 km ?* (range = 2-10 km?). Population density varies from 0-32-1-69 individuals/km?. Home ranges are defended, with larger groups usually displacing smaller groups. A group can cover up to 6 km in a day. Groups have around five dens within their home range; they generally occupy a different den every few days, but may use a den for longer periods when pups are present. Groups also have up to 1000 boltholes on their territory that they run to when danger threatens. Group encounters often result in chases or fights. When a fight occurs it is usually accompanied by piloerection, erection of the tail, tiptoe body stance, and a “war dance”. Groups are highly social, with grooming and marking utilized to maintain group bonding. Groups contain adult males and females, and the young of the dominant pair; the adult sex ratio is approximately equal. Within a group, most subordinate adults are related to the dominant female, but immigrant males are also commonly present. There is evidence of a dominance hierarchy, with dominant males and females regularly displacing subordinates from disputed sites, and marking four to five times more frequently. In addition, subordinate approaches and allogrooming are characterized by “creeping” behavior. Aggression over food items is common, but usually settled in favor of the owner. The group works as a whole in rearing young and repelling predators. Vocal communications include contact calls, emitted every few seconds, which maintain group cohesion while foraging. Growls and spits are used to defend resources from approach by another group member. Short, sharp alarm calls elicit rapid evasive behavior. These are most frequently given by individuals who are “on guard”, standing erect on a raised mound or dead tree. Group members take turns going “on guard” and give a “watchman’s song” to inform the group that they are sentries. Alarm calls carry specific information on predator type (aerial or terrestrial) and urgency. “Worry” calls warn group members of lower intensity danger. Pups emit two types of begging call, a constant repeat call and a highpitched “give-me-food” call when an adult finds a prey item. Olfactory communication is used for both intraand inter-group communication. Group members scent-mark by wiping each other and objects (e.g. rocks) with their anal gland.

Communal latrines are used to mark territory. Dominant individuals usually mark a territory. Breeding. Females rarely conceive before they are two years old. The Meerkat is believed to be an induced ovulator and births are restricted to the wetter, warmer months (presumably correlated with invertebrate prey availability). Mating is rarely observed, occurring in the subterranean den, but mate-guarding by the dominant male has been observed. The Meerkat exhibits a despotic social system of high reproductive skew: generally only the dominant pair breeds. Dominant females produce 75% of litters and dominant males father 80% of pups within the group. In some cases this is due to inbreeding avoidance. When a second or subordinate female conceives,it is usually followed by infanticide or den desertion. Non-pregnant subordinate females are often evicted by the dominant female during the late stages of her pregnancy, but are allowed to return to the group after the birth of the dominant female's pups. The number oflitters per female per year varies from one to three, with dominant females producing more litters per year (mean 2-8) than subordinates (mean 0-9). The gestation period is approximately 70 days. Mean fetallitter size is 4-1 (range = 1-8); litter size at birth is three to seven. If more than one female gives birth within a group, the births usually occur within one week. The interbirth interval can be as little as 73 days, indicating that females can conceive within 4-12 days of parturition. The young are born with eyes and ears closed and short hair. Pup weight at birth is 25-36 g. Eyes open at 10-14 days. Following birth of the litter, pups are retained in the subterranean den until they are three to four weeks of age. The sex ratio of the pups at emergence from the den is approximately equal. During the period in the den, one or more individuals will remain at the den to “babysit” the pups, while the group forages. The babysitter usually changes every day. These babysitters guard the pups from predators and also probably help keep the pups warm. Breeder adults do relatively little babysitting; nonbreeding subordinates (helpers) make higher individual contributions. Allosuckling occurs: pups suckle milk from numerous females, including females that have not given birth. Weaning occurs at around two months of age (49-63 days). When the pups emerge from the den and begin accompanying the foraging group, helpers provide care by carrying and provisioning pups and defending them against predators. Provisioning involves dropping or leaving whole or partial prey items. In contrast to the social behavior of the Banded Mongoose, there is no pup escorting system and pups move between group members begging for food. Nevertheless, pup survival is higher in groups with more helpers. Although many litters fail completely within the first month (21%), 70% of pups are estimated to survive from weaning to independence. Annual survival rate for pups is 0-20, with adult annual survival rate a low 0-68. Annual survival rates of group members older than pups are dependent upon predator density. Predators likely include snakes (e.g. cape cobra Naja nivea ), mammalian carnivores (e.g. Black-backed Jackal), and raptors (e.g. martial eagle Polemaetus bellicosus , bateleur eagle Terathopius ecaudatus , tawny eagle Aquila rapax , and pale chanting-goshawk Melierax canorus ). In addition, pups are killed by neighboring Meerkat groups. There is no sex-bias to dispersal, but dispersal mode differs between the sexes. Subordinate females are forceably evicted by the dominant female, but males tend to leave voluntarily and prospect for females in other groups. Meerkats can live to over eight years in wild, and over twelve years in captivity. On following pages: 25. Alexander's Cusimanse ( Crossarchus alexandri); 26.

S. s. suricatta Schreber, 1776 — Botswana , South Africa , possibly Lesotho , and Kalahari Desert in Namibia . S. s. iona Cabral, 1971 — SW Angola . S. s. marjoniae Bradfield, 1936 — Namibia (Namib Desert). Descriptive notes. Head-body 24.5-29 cm (males), 26-285 cm (females), tail 20.5-24 cm (males), 19-23 cm (females), hindfoot 6:3.7-4 cm (males), 6-5—7-4 cm (females), ear 2-1 cm (18-26) (males), 1-8 cm (17-20) (females); weight 626-797 g (males), 620-969 g (females). Females become significantly larger and heavier upon assuming dominantstatus, averaging 750 g ; nondominant females average 710 g . The Meerkat is a small mongoose, with a relatively large pointed muzzle. It has coarse, pale-gray, tan, orsilvery-brown fur, with dark transverse bands across the back, and black eye patches. The underparts are paler than the dorsum; the coat color is darker in the southern part of the species’ range. The fur on the tail is short, sparse on the underside, and yellowish with a black tip. The guard hairs are 15 mm at shoulder, increasing to 30-40 mm at the rump, decreasing to 20 mm at base of the tail and tapering to 12 mm attail tip. The dorsal guard hairs are light at the base, have two dark rings separated by a light band, and a silvery tip. The small, rounded ears can close to keep dust out while the animal digs: the posterior and superior ear ridges move forward and down. The tail is slender, not bushy, and the legs are thin. The muscular forelimbs have four digits, each with long claws ( 15 mm ). The hindfeet also have four digits, with shorter claws ( 8 mm ). The feet are naked to the wrist/ankle. There are three pairs of mammae. Meerkats lack cheek glands. The skull is high, broad, and rounded. Hindchambers of ear bullae larger relative to anterior. Closed orbital space. Relatively large eye sockets (more than 20% total skull length). Supra-orbital crest represented by low ridge. Saggital crest not present. Light zygomatic arches. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1/,P 3/3, M 2/2 = 36. Outer upper incisors larger than other incisors. Upper canines straight,slightly flattened on inside. Lower canines distinctly recurved. Broad molars with sharp cusps. Poorly developed carnassial shear adapted for insectivory. Habitat. Open semi-arid areas, scrub, rangeland, and grassland. Subterranean dens are used, which tend to be extensive, with multiple entrances and chambers. The temperatures within dens are more stable and comfortable than the hot and cold extremes on the surface. Meerkats are good diggers, and are likely to excavate some dens themselves, but usually occupy dens dug by other small mammals. Dens may be shared with South African Ground Squirrels or Yellow Mongooses. Food and Feeding. Insectivorous diet, especially Coleoptera (beetles), Arachnids (scorpions and spiders), and Myriapoda (centipedes) larvae. Occasionally vertebrates (including lizards and small snakes) are consumed. Frequency of occurrence of food types from 23 stomachs collected from Botswana : Coleoptera larvae (91%), Scorpiones (35%), Coleoptera adults (17%), Orthoptera (17%), Myriapoda (13%), Reptilia (13%), and Isoptera (9%). Frequency of occurrence of prey items in 98 stomachs collected from Orange Free State ( South Africa ): Coleoptera (58%), Lepidoptera (pupae and larvae) (43%), Isoptera (40%), Orthoptera (34%), Diptera (pupae, larvae) (23%), Arachnida (21%), Hymenoptera (15%), Dermaptera (12%), Chilopoda (10%), Dictyoptera (10%), Diplopoda (9%), Amphibia (5%), Reptilia (5%), Aves (2%), and Hemiptera (1%). Meerkats move as a loose group, with individuals foraging independently. Individuals generally walk, sniffing and scraping at the ground surface, and often stop and dig intensively for prey—sometimes disappearing from view in the deep hole they have dug. Potential food items, foraging holes and scrapes, are generally defended from approach by others, except for adults sharing food with young pups. Activity patterns. Diurnal. A group sleeps together overnight in a subterranean den, emerging in early morning and returning before sunset. During the day the group forages together, usually resting in a shady area around midday. They usually start the day by sunbathing at the den and end the day relaxing by the den. Their behavioral repertoire includes foraging, resting, vigilance (including standing erect), self and allogrooming, social play, scent marking, and vocalization. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Meerkats live in social groups that share a home range, which theyjointly defend. Mean group size is 4-2 to 8:5 individuals (range = 3-20), with up to 49 recorded. Mean home range size is 5 km ?* (range = 2-10 km?). Population density varies from 0-32-1-69 individuals/km?. Home ranges are defended, with larger groups usually displacing smaller groups. A group can cover up to 6 km in a day. Groups have around five dens within their home range; they generally occupy a different den every few days, but may use a den for longer periods when pups are present. Groups also have up to 1000 boltholes on their territory that they run to when danger threatens. Group encounters often result in chases or fights. When a fight occurs it is usually accompanied by piloerection, erection of the tail, tiptoe body stance, and a “war dance”. Groups are highly social, with grooming and marking utilized to maintain group bonding. Groups contain adult males and females, and the young of the dominant pair; the adult sex ratio is approximately equal. Within a group, most subordinate adults are related to the dominant female, but immigrant males are also commonly present. There is evidence of a dominance hierarchy, with dominant males and females regularly displacing subordinates from disputed sites, and marking four to five times more frequently. In addition, subordinate approaches and allogrooming are characterized by “creeping” behavior. Aggression over food items is common, but usually settled in favor of the owner. The group works as a whole in rearing young and repelling predators. Vocal communications include contact calls, emitted every few seconds, which maintain group cohesion while foraging. Growls and spits are used to defend resources from approach by another group member. Short, sharp alarm calls elicit rapid evasive behavior. These are most frequently given by individuals who are “on guard”, standing erect on a raised mound or dead tree. Group members take turns going “on guard” and give a “watchman’s song” to inform the group that they are sentries. Alarm calls carry specific information on predator type (aerial or terrestrial) and urgency. “Worry” calls warn group members of lower intensity danger. Pups emit two types of begging call, a constant repeat call and a highpitched “give-me-food” call when an adult finds a prey item. Olfactory communication is used for both intraand inter-group communication. Group members scent-mark by wiping each other and objects (e.g. rocks) with their anal gland. Such marking is often done communally, with all group members involved in synchronous bouts of scent marking. Urine and feces are also apparently used in communication, with individuals overmarking excretion sites. These “signals” from other groups often elicit excited and aggressive responses. Communal latrines are used to mark territory. Dominant individuals usually mark a territory. Breeding. Females rarely conceive before they are two years old. The Meerkat is believed to be an induced ovulator and births are restricted to the wetter, warmer months (presumably correlated with invertebrate prey availability). Mating is rarely observed, occurring in the subterranean den, but mate-guarding by the dominant male has been observed. The Meerkat exhibits a despotic social system of high reproductive skew: generally only the dominant pair breeds. Dominant females produce 75% of litters and dominant males father 80% of pups within the group. In some cases this is due to inbreeding avoidance. When a second or subordinate female conceives,it is usually followed by infanticide or den desertion. Non-pregnant subordinate females are often evicted by the dominant female during the late stages of her pregnancy, but are allowed to return to the group after the birth of the dominant female's pups. The number oflitters per female per year varies from one to three, with dominant females producing more litters per year (mean 2-8) than subordinates (mean 0-9). The gestation period is approximately 70 days. Mean fetallitter size is 4-1 (range = 1-8); litter size at birth is three to seven. If more than one female gives birth within a group, the births usually occur within one week. The interbirth interval can be as little as 73 days, indicating that females can conceive within 4-12 days of parturition. The young are born with eyes and ears closed and short hair. Pup weight at birth is 25-36 g. Eyes open at 10-14 days. Following birth of the litter, pups are retained in the subterranean den until they are three to four weeks of age. The sex ratio of the pups at emergence from the den is approximately equal. During the period in the den, one or more individuals will remain at the den to “babysit” the pups, while the group forages. The babysitter usually changes every day. These babysitters guard the pups from predators and also probably help keep the pups warm.

Activity patterns. Hunts mainly at dusk and in the early morning. Often seen basking outside its den during the day. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Nothing known. Breeding. Birth dens found in rock crevices or abandoned burrows of foxes and marmots. Dens contain bedding composed of plants, rodent skins, feathers, and prey remains. Mating occurs in February and March, accompanied by frequent vocalizations. Period of sexual receptivity is short, 26 to 42 hours. Gestation about 66-75 days, and 4-6 kittens are born in April and May. Kittens weigh 80-90 g at birth, 500-600 g at two months of age. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Widely distributed but uncommon. Hunting prohibited in most countries in its range but the species is still illegally hunted forits pelt. Habitat destruction and poisoning to control pika populations also threaten it. Unstudied in the wild until recently, when they were captured and radio-collared as part of a veterinary study to characterize parasite load and physiologic and genetic parameters. Bibliography.

They are found in a great variety of forest types, from lowland tropical evergreen rainforest and rubber and oil palm plantations at sea level to moist temperate broadleaf and dry coniferous forests in the Himalayas at 3000 m . Also does well in successional habitats, shrub forest, farmlands, and on coastal islands. It is rarely found in cold steppe grasslands or arid areas. In Russia is commonly associated with river valleys, forested ravines and coastal habitats where the cover is deciduous broadleaf forest. Their small feet are not well adapted for moving in deep snow and they avoid areas where snow depth exceeds 10 cm . Radio-collared cats in Thailand’s Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary rarely visited the dry deciduous dipterocarp forest, a firemaintained habitat with little understory vegetation; they preferred mixed deciduous and dry evergreen forest habitats, especially those associated with watercourses. These habitats not only offered more cover but they also harbored more prey. Similarly, radio-tagged cats in Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, used the oil palm plantations just outside the Reserve more than expected, presumably because of the high density of Whitehead’s Rats, the cats’ principle prey.","Feeds on a variety of small prey, including rodents, reptiles, birds, amphibians, crabs, and insects. They are excellent swimmers and captives spend much time playing in water. Small birds were the principal prey in Pakistan ; secondary prey included wood mice ( Muridae ) and flying squirrels. In Kaeng Krachan National Park, Thailand , small mammals, principally Rattus spp. and Mus spp. were the dominant prey; incidential prey included Tree Shrews and hares. Based on an analysis of 230 scats, on Tsushima Island, Japan , fed largely on murid rats (726%), but they also ate moles, birds, amphibians, and insects. On Iriomote Island, 95 prey species were identified in 849 scats. Rats were the dominant prey, but flying foxes, skinks, and birds were also important. Incidental prey included amphibians, crabs, and insects. In Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah , murid rats, especially Whitehead’s Sundaic Maxomys and the Sundaic Arboreal Niviventer , formed the bulk of the diet, although lizards, snakes, and frogs were also important, particularly in the wet season. On Peninsular Malaysia , forest and field rats ( Muridae ) were the major prey, but the remains of lizards ( Varanidae ), snakes ( Xenopeltidae ), tree shrews, and crabs were also identified in stomachs. Acitivity patterns. Radio-collared individuals in Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, were nocturnal, but levels of nighttime activity were significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season. While the levels of nocturnal activity were reduced in the wet season, their levels of daytime activity were significantly higher than in the dry season. The activity patterns of radio-collared individuals in Thailand were arrhythmic, which was attributed to them foraging extensively on both nocturnal and diurnal prey. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In the dry season at Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, radio-tagged males traveled an average of 1-72 km per night compared to 1-27 km for females; average distances traveled per night in the wet season decreased to 1:06 km and 0-87 km, respectively. Males traveled faster and farther than females, but for both sexes, movement rates were higher in the first half of the night than in the second half. Movement rates for females tended to be slower because their travels were frequently punctuated with long periods of no movement, during which they were presumably sitting and waiting for prey. All observations (n = 67) in Tabin were of solitary individuals. The home ranges of four resident males varied from 2:64 to 3-8 km®. The ranges of two resident females measured 1-93 and 2-25 km*. Ranges of resident males overlapped those of one or more females. In Thailand , the mean home range size in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was 4-33 km?

Differences in home range sizes are in part related to body size, as cats in Thailand are larger than those on the islands of Borneo and Tsuchima. The effects of differences in resource levels and other environmental conditions among the sites on home range sizes are not known.

In the northern portion ofits range,is a seasonal breeder, in Russia kittens are born in May. For those living closer to the Equator, births may occur in any month. Gestation lasts 60-70 days and littersize is typically 2-3 young. Young weigh 75-130 g at birth and open their eyes at 10-15 days of age. By the time they are two weeks old, kittens have doubled their birth weight. Permanent canines erupt at about four weeks, which coincides with the young beginning to eat solid food. This new diet results in rapid weight gain and by 13 weeks of age the young have increased their birth weight tenfold. At nine months the young are nearly adult size. In captivity, sexual maturity occurs as early as eight months, and one female produced herfirst litter at 13-14 months of age.","Listed on CITES Appendix II, except for populations in India , Thailand , and Bangladesh , which are listed on CITES Appendix I.

There are also estimated stockpiles of more than 800,000 pelts in Chinese fur company warehouses. Leopard Cat coats are frequently sold in Nepal and Kashmir. Whereit is not persecuted, appears to be able to coexist with humans.

In Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah , murid rats, especially Whitehead’s Sundaic Maxomys and the Sundaic Arboreal Niviventer , formed the bulk of the diet, although lizards, snakes, and frogs were also important, particularly in the wet season. On Peninsular Malaysia , forest and field rats ( Muridae ) were the major prey, but the remains of lizards ( Varanidae ), snakes ( Xenopeltidae ), tree shrews, and crabs were also identified in stomachs. Acitivity patterns. Radio-collared individuals in Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, were nocturnal, but levels of nighttime activity were significantly higher in the dry season than in the wet season. While the levels of nocturnal activity were reduced in the wet season, their levels of daytime activity were significantly higher than in the dry season. The activity patterns of radio-collared individuals in Thailand were arrhythmic, which was attributed to them foraging extensively on both nocturnal and diurnal prey. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In the dry season at Tabin Wildlife Reserve, Sabah, radio-tagged males traveled an average of 1-72 km per night compared to 1-27 km for females; average distances traveled per night in the wet season decreased to 1:06 km and 0-87 km, respectively. Males traveled faster and farther than females, but for both sexes, movement rates were higher in the first half of the night than in the second half. Movement rates for females tended to be slower because their travels were frequently punctuated with long periods of no movement, during which they were presumably sitting and waiting for prey. All observations (n = 67) in Tabin were of solitary individuals. The home ranges of four resident males varied from 2:64 to 3-8 km®. The ranges of two resident females measured 1-93 and 2-25 km*. Ranges of resident males overlapped those of one or more females. In Thailand , the mean home range size in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was 4-33 km? (range 1-5-7-5 km*) and in Kaeng Krachan National Park it was 3-38 km? (range 2:3-5-4 km?®). On Tsuchima Island, Japan , the mean home range size was 0-83 km?®. Differences in home range sizes are in part related to body size, as cats in Thailand are larger than those on the islands of Borneo and Tsuchima. The effects of differences in resource levels and other environmental conditions among the sites on home range sizes are not known. Some differences in home range sizes may also be due to different methods of analysis. The density in Tabin was estimated at 37-5 adults/ 100 km ? which is comparable to the density on Iriomote Island of 34/ 100 km ?®. Breeding. In the northern portion ofits range,is a seasonal breeder, in Russia kittens are born in May. For those living closer to the Equator, births may occur in any month. Gestation lasts 60-70 days and littersize is typically 2-3 young. Young weigh 75-130 g at birth and open their eyes at 10-15 days of age. By the time they are two weeks old, kittens have doubled their birth weight. Permanent canines erupt at about four weeks, which coincides with the young beginning to eat solid food. This new diet results in rapid weight gain and by 13 weeks of age the young have increased their birth weight tenfold. At nine months the young are nearly adult size. In captivity, sexual maturity occurs as early as eight months, and one female produced herfirst litter at 13-14 months of age. Status and Conservation. Listed on CITES Appendix II, except for populations in India , Thailand , and Bangladesh , which are listed on CITES Appendix I. Classified as a species of Least Concern on the The IUCN Red List. Heavily hunted in many parts of its range and its pelt figures prominently in the fur trade. The Chinese government has set an annual harvest quota of 150,000 individuals, but the actual harvest is probably higher. There are also estimated stockpiles of more than 800,000 pelts in Chinese fur company warehouses. Leopard Cat coats are frequently sold in Nepal and Kashmir. Whereit is not persecuted, appears to be able to coexist with humans. It seems to be an adaptable species, and has been found in secondary forest, successional vegetation, tea, coffee, rubber, and oil palm plantations. Bibliography.

The smallest cat in Africa. Small stocky cat with broad head and large, widely spaced, rounded ears. The nose is very small and varies from red to black in color. Eyes are dark yellow to light greenish. The soft fur grows longer and denser during winter. The margins of the eyes, ears and mouth are white. There are two black cheek stripes running from the corner of the eyes and from below the eyes to the edge of the face. On the back of the neck there are four black bands, two running along the back and onto the shoulder. The body color varies from cinnamon buff to tawny or off-white. There are bold black or rust-tinged bands or rings on the shoulders and high on the legs, up to five on the hindlegs and two on the front, and distinct spots of the same color on the body. The throat has two or three black to reddish stripes that are either solid or broken up. The underparts are pale buff or white. The tailis short (less than 40% of head-body length) and narrowly black-tipped; the backs of the ears are the same color as the body. The hair on the undersides of the front paws and back legs is black. The skull is high and rounded. The auditory bullae are exceptionally large, their total length being 25% of the total skull length and their width, at the widest point 18%. Races not well defined, possibly representing a geographical cline from the smaller, paler nominate, with more bleached ground color and less distinctive brown striping, to the larger, more vividly colored thomas: with jet black bands and spots.","Inhabits dry, open savanna, grasslands, and Karoo semi-desert (savanna biome) with sparse shrub and tree cover with a mean annual rainfall of between 100-500 mm annually; absent from the driest and sandiest parts of the Namib and Kalahari Deserts. Seems to avoid rocky terrain and bushy country. Presence of South African Spring Hare burrows and Trinervitermes termitaria for shelter may be crucial since 98% of 184 resting places in central South Africa were in abandoned South African Spring Hare burrows. In some areas frequently uses hollowed out termitaria; hence the common name “anthill-tiger.” Also rests under rock slabs.","Opportunistic carnivore, taking everything it can overpower. Of seven stomachs collected in Botswana four contained murid rodents, three spiders, and one each elephant shrews, reptiles, insects, and birds. In central South Africa 43 vertebrate prey species identified. 14 mammal species comprised 72% of the total prey mass consumed. Most important, with 39% of prey mass, were murids; 21 species of birds (26%), mainly larks, with eggs of various species taken; eight species of frogs and reptiles ( Gekkonidae , Scincidae , Colubridae ); prey up to the size of hares, mongooses and pigeons, sandgrouse, and bustards taken. A minimum of ten invertebrate species were eaten, some as small as the alates of harvester termites. Average preysize is 24 g . In central South Africa on average males kill larger prey; the smaller and more agile females are more successful in catching small birds. In summer both sexes concentrate on abundant small rodents. In winter a higher proportion of larger (over 100 g ) birds and mammals are taken. Three different hunting styles identified: “fast-hunt” when moves in swift bounds at 1-2 km/h trying to flush prey from cover; “slow-hunt” involving a slow stalk at an average speed of 0-5—-0-8 km/h, while looking and listening carefully; and “sit-down”, waiting at a rodent den system for up to two hours. About 70% of the night is spent moving. Birds are sometimes snatched from the air. Hunting success very high, about one vertebrate prey animal caught every 50 minutes and 10-14 rodents or small birds caught per night, representing 200-300 g of food or about 20% of the body weight; record intakes can reach 450 g per night. Excess food is cached and scavenged readily. Independent of water but will drink occasionally when wateris available. Activity patterns. Nocturnal and crepuscular; when moving during daylight birds mob them. Hunting occurs throughout the night in all weather conditions and temperatures. Are occasionally shadowed by Marsh Owls, which catch flushed prey animals. Small body size allows the cat to hunt and rest in open arid areas. Its auditory bullae are exceptionally well-developed, enhancing hearing ability in areas with little vegetation cover. Considered to be the southern representative of the Sand Cat, which has similar proportions. Sight is acute for crepuscular and nocturnal hunting. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Nightly travel distance is between 4-5 and 16 km (mean = 8 km ). Males have larger cumulative home ranges (17-6 km?) than females (9-5 km?) and their ranges overlap those of 1-4 females. Intra-sexual overlap is marginal. Home range size is likely to vary between regions according to local resource availability. Solitary, except during mating; the only other prolonged social contact are females with dependent kittens. Communicate mainly through urine spray marking; frequency of female spraying fluctuates strongly during the year, depending on the stage of reproductive cycle, with high frequency before mating, low when pregnant, and no spraying when rearing kittens. Males spray intensively prior to mating, up to 585 sprays per night. Scent rubbing and possibly claw-raking may have signalling function. Feces are rarely covered or deposited on middens. Vocal communication, a loud meowing sound, repeated up to ten times in quick succession, mostly from males looking for females during mating season. Females rarely call in estrus. Soft calls used by males courting females and by females calling kittens. Females give special alarm call, with ears depressed, to kittens. The adult sex ratio in the wild was four males to six females. Birth sex ratio is 1-16: 1 in captivity.

Birth weight 60-90 g. Kittens born in hollow termite mound (“ant hill”), or South African Spring Hare burrow; mother leaves kittens for two hours on night of birth and resumes her nocturnal hunting schedule after four days, returning infrequently to suckle kittens. Kittens moved frequently after the first week; they develop rapidly, opening eyes at 3-9 days, first take solid food at 30 days, weaned within two months. Female carries prey items to them for feeding and teaching kittens to hunt live prey. Kittens independent after 3-4 months, but remain within mother’s range for extended periods. Sexual maturity (in captivity) is seven months for females and nine months for males. On following pages: 35. Sand Cat ( Felis margarita ); 36. Chinese Mountain Cat ( Felis bieti ); 37.

Mate often, 6-10 copulations during 36hour female estrous period; resident male guards females and chases and fights with intruding males. Gestation is 63-68 days; up to two litters in the spring and summer season, coinciding with the rains and high availability of food. No litters in winter. Litter size 1-4, but usually two. Birth weight 60-90 g. Kittens born in hollow termite mound (“ant hill”), or South African Spring Hare burrow; mother leaves kittens for two hours on night of birth and resumes her nocturnal hunting schedule after four days, returning infrequently to suckle kittens. Kittens moved frequently after the first week; they develop rapidly, opening eyes at 3-9 days, first take solid food at 30 days, weaned within two months. Female carries prey items to them for feeding and teaching kittens to hunt live prey. Kittens independent after 3-4 months, but remain within mother’s range for extended periods. Sexual maturity (in captivity) is seven months for females and nine months for males. On following pages: 35. Sand Cat ( Felis margarita ); 36. Chinese Mountain Cat ( Felis bieti ); 37. Wildcat ( Felis silvestris ). Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The [UCN Red List. South African red data book: rare; very inconspicuous,shy, difficult to census; 8 adults/ 60 km ? in central South Africa ; in low quality habitat densities probably lower; species may be expanding in some areas; threats include expansion of human settlement and arable agriculture, use of poison, desertification, and overgrazing with bush encroachment. May be susceptible to locust poisoning. Farmers setting “coyote-getters” and poisoning carcasses during control operations targeting other predators may affect since they readily scavenge. Night calling and shooting aimed at Black-backed Jackal also impacts this species in the central Karoo. Cats also fall victim to dogs, used to chase or dig outjackals during problem animal operations. Young or sick individuals and kittens are vulnerable to Black-backed Jackal and Caracal predation. Kittens and possibly adults may fall victim to large nocturnal raptors such as eagle-owls (Bubo africanus, B. capensis, B. lacteus); both wild and captive individuals often die of kidney failure (amyloidosis), indicated by high urea concentrations in the blood.

The following measurements are recorded from Europe: head-body 54.7-65. 5 cm (males), 47.3-57. 5 cm (females), tail 27.6-32. 6 cm (males), 25.7-32 cm (females); weight 3-77.7-26 kg (males), 2-35—4-68 kg (females). Larger and more robust than domestic cats and have relatively longer legs. Adult males are slightly larger and heavier than adult females. In Africa the fur color and markings are highly variable, ranging from grayish to reddish, with or without small spots. The fur is soft, and the hairs often have a pale subterminal band and black tip, giving the pelage a slightly speckled appearance. Spots sometimes coalesce to form transverse stripes or black bars, especially prominent on the legs. The long, thin tail often ends with two or three blackish rings and a black tip. The head is narrow, sometimes with rufous or dark lines. The ears are rounded and widely separated, with short dark tufts; the backs of the ears are a bright red-brown. The chin is white, the underparts are pale orangebuff to whitish, and there is a line of darker hair down the spine from the shoulder to base oftail. Soles of feet are black. In general, Wildcats that live in dryer areas tend to be pale or tawny colored and those from humid areas tend to be darker and more heavily spotted and striped. Lightly built and long-legged. When sitting upright the long front legs raise the body to an almost vertical position. The long legs, narrow chest, and high shoulder blades impart a cheetah-like appearance to its motion. The Wildcats of India , Pakistan , and neighboring Russian are pale sandy, gray, or isabelline in color. The spot pattern is variable: the spots can be large, small, distinct, blurred, black, brown, or grayish. In some cats the spots along the back form a dark line. The tail is long, thin, and spotted near the base but ringed toward the black-tipped end. In Wildcats from Mongolia the spots are fused to form unbroken lines. One or two dark bands circle the upper foreand hindlegs. The underparts are whitish and unspotted. The backs of the ears are yellowish-buff or khaki, and there is a characteristic tuft of dark hair on the tip of each ear. The relatively long limbs, long tail, and long body distinguish the Wildcat from its domestic relatives. In Europe, the background coat color varies from yellowish-brown to buff gray and even silvery. The coat is marked with a variable pattern of “tabby” stripes. There are usually four broad nape stripes, a single dorsalstripe, which ends at the root ofthe tail, and 3-5 rings on the bushytail, which has a blunt, black tip. Body stripes are variable; they are most distinct in the west and there is a cline to the east where almost no striping is apparent. Melanism,flavism, and white spotting have been recorded very rarely, and may result from introgressive hybridization with domestic cats. The skull is similar to that of domestic cat, but it has a significantly greater cranial volume, differently-shaped nasals and interparietal suture, and a well-developed angular process on the mandible.","In Africa, Wildcats are found in a variety of habitat types from sea level to about 3000 m , but appear to be absent from tropical rain forest and from areas that receive less than 100 mm of annual rainfall. Some cover for hunting and rest sites may be important, but cats in Ngorongoro Crater were seen to use the open grasslands, where they rely on holes dug by other animals to escape from larger carnivores. In Botswana Wildcats were seen at night in open woodlands and grasslands. In Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, the cats were more commonly seen in drier woodland and scrub habitats than in areas close to water. A radio-tagged Wildcat in Kenya was frequently located in woodlands and grasslands; riverine forest and agricultural lands were infrequently used. Wildcats in Israel prefer open Mediterranean forest in hilly areas. The Wildcat also occurs on the outskirts of villages and towns, thus bringing it into contact with domestic cats. Wildcats in Asia inhabit thickets of Acacia, Maytenus, Cappanris, Tamarix , and Prosopis in the desert in western Rajasthan , India ; in Pakistan the cats are sparsely distributed in the desert regions of south-west Baluchistan and scattered throughout the dryer hilly regions on the western bank of the Indus. In Turkmenistan , Tajikistan , and Uzbekistan these cats live in tamarisk, saxaul, and saltwort thickets and shrub vegetation. In Kazakhstan , Wildcats are found in the bush and reeds fringing lakes and rivers; in the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains they use bushy areas up to 2000 m . Wildcats use natural caves for shelter or excavates their own burrows. In Europe Wildcats are typically found in broad-leafed and mixed woodlands, particularly in mainland Europe. Coniferous forest use is probably marginal. They are also found in Mediterranean maquis scrubland,riparian woodland, and along the edges of marshes and coasts (but not in marsh edges and coasts in Scotland ). They avoid very high mountains, exposed coasts, and intensive agricultural, urban, and industrial habitats, and are not found where snow covers more than 50% of the terrain, is more than 20 cm deep, or remains for 100 days or more each year. Where large-scale deforestation has occurred (e.g., in Scotland ), Wildcats have adapted to living in the foothills of mountains and on moorland where rough grazing occurs, and are often associated with forest and cropland. They require some kind of coverto lie up in when inactive. Forestry plantations may provide important habitat in the early stages. They are frequently seen hunting in grasslands adjacent to woodland in Europe.","Murids rodents are the dominant prey in most areas in Africa, although larger prey such as spring hares, rabbits, and possibly young antelope are sometimes taken. May also be serious predators of poultry. In Zimbabwe and Botswana about three-quarters of all stomachs examined contained murid rodents. Birds, principally doves, quail, and weavers, ranked second. Incidental prey included lizards, skinks, and snakes. In a semi-desert area of Botswana a common prey identified in stomachs was hunting spiders (Solifugidae). In the Namib Desert the remains of small mammals were found in more than 90% of scats; insects occurred in 70% of scats. Similar percentages of small rodents and insects were found in Wildcat feces from Karoo National Park, South Africa . In the Sahara Wildcats were seen 15 km from the nearest waterhole, suggesting they can do without drinking water. In Asia the cats feed principally on rodents, but will take other prey opportunistically, including insects, lizards, snakes, birds, and are known to raid domestic poultry pens. The prey along the Ili River, Kazakhstan , consisted largely (81%) of hares, muskrats, gerbils, House Mice, and jerboas. In western Rajasthan, the Wildcat’s diet was largely jirds ( Muridae ) and hares, but it was also seen hunting a variety of ground-foraging birds (doves, partridge, sandgrouse, peafowl, pigeons). Snakes, including cobras, saw-scaled vipers, and sand boas were also killed, as were geckos, scorpions, and large beetles. In mainland Europe Wildcats feed predominantly on mice and voles, but in Scotland , rabbits and other lagomorphs are by far the most important prey (up to 70% by frequency in the east). Studies in Scotland have shown that predation on birds, especially game birds,is insignificant. Primarily terrestrial hunter, but can climb well if pursued. They may hunt in trees for rats in flooded forest in Caucasus. Hunt either by waiting in ambush for prey, e.g., outside rabbit burrows, or hunt opportunistically when patrolling home ranges. Moving slowly and quietly along trails and paths, looking and listening for prey. Once prey is detected, creeps forward, patiently, using every piece of cover to get as close as possible before making its attack. Prey seized with the claws and pinned to the ground, or held with the paws until the killing bite delivered. Prey may be cached either by hiding it under vegetation, in holes and trees, or by covering it with debris. Activity patterns. Secretive, and most reports suggest they are strictly nocturnal, although in areas where undisturbed sometimes seen in early morning and late afternoon. In Pakistan reportedly shelter underground or in dense cover during the heat of the day and emerge at night to hunt. In Turkmenistan described as crepuscular, but in Uzbekistan found active at any time of the day in all seasons. In the northern part of their European range, often also active during daylight in winter, butstrictly nocturnal in summer. May remain inactive for up to 28 hours during heavy snowfall or rain and strong winds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Little known of social habits in Africa, most sightings are of solitary animals. Anecdotal information suggests animals are highly territorial. The home range of a radio-collared adult male in Kenya was 1-6 km? over the short time followed. In contrast, the home ranges of a radio-tagged male and female Wildcat in the United Arab Emirates measured 28-7 km2 and 52-7 km2, respectively. While the male’s range was smaller than that of the female, he was only tracked for 1-5 months compared to 14 months for the female. The male did, however, travel farther per night than the female, 8-64 km/night and 4-86 km/night, respectively. Over the 14 months she was tracked, the female was located to 42 dens, all of which were burrows made by Red Foxes. In Asia, also, outside of mating associations, are solitary. In south-west Tajikistan the area used for hunting was thought to cover about 3—4 km ?. In a steppe habitat of Uzbekistan , two animals occupied an area of 10 km ?. In eastern Scotland , where rabbits were abundant, mean annual home range size was 1-75 km? for both sexes; in western Scotland , where rabbits were scarce, home ranges were much larger (9-10 km? for males and 8-10 km* for females). Home ranges of males in Scotland may overlap with one or more of those of females, but there is usually little intrasexual overlap. Social groupings comprise mostly mothers with kittens, but also dispersing siblings and males with females in estrus. Communication mainly by scent marking, including spraying urine and depositing feces in prominent places near trails on trees, vegetation, and boulders. Feces may be combined with anal sacgland secretions. Trees and saplings may be scratched using forepaws, leaving a visual marker and an olfactory sign from interdigital gland secretion.",,"Secretive, and most reports suggest they are strictly nocturnal, although in areas where undisturbed sometimes seen in early morning and late afternoon.

Feces may be combined with anal sacgland secretions. Trees and saplings may be scratched using forepaws, leaving a visual marker and an olfactory sign from interdigital gland secretion. Breeding. Mating is noisy, marked by much screeching and yowling. In the northern Sahara, breed in winter. In southern and East Africa, small young found in all months of the year, but tend to be born during the wet season, which coincides with peaks in rodent abundance. In Central Asia, mating takes place in January-February, and in Rajasthan, in November-December and March-April. In southern Sind , Pakistan , breeding may occur at any season of the year. The female is in heat for about four days; ovulation occurs a day after copulation. Wildcats are induced ovulators. Females come into estrus every six weeks unless conception occurs. Gestation lasts from 56 to 65 days. Typically two or three kittens (maximum five) born, furred and blind, in a wellconcealed location. Kittens have been found in hollow trees, underground burrows, rocky crevices, and dense grass. The young first emerge from the natal den at one month and are weaned and introduced to hunting between 3—4 months. In captivity, a female introduced her young to live prey when they were 60 days old, and two days later, the male kittens were killing mice on their own. By the fourth day the female kitten did likewise. In the wild a female was seen bringing injured gerbils to the den for her young to try to kill. Kittens are independent by 5-6 months. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months and males at about twelve months. In captivity, signs of sexual activity were observed in a female who was just over nine months of age and gave birth to a single kitten ( 80 g ) when was eleven months old. In the wild a female born in April was pregnant when caught in late January. In captivity two year-old males attempted to mate with a female who was showing signs of coming into estrus, but in the wild the testes of males were not developed until the cats were 21-22 months of age. In Europe most mating occurs January-March, although the breeding season may extend December—July. Estrus lasts for 2-9 days; if no conception occurs, recycle in about 14 days. Most births occur in April and May after a gestation period of 60-68 days, but births may extend March—-August. Usually only one litter per year, but may have a second if a litteris lost early. Litter sizes in capitivity range from 1-8 (average of 3-4) and in the wild, from 1-7. At birth, kittens weigh 65-163 g (and usually do not survive at less than 90 g ). Lactation lasts for 6-7 weeks but may continue sporadically for up to four months. The eyes open at 7-13 days, the kittens begin walking at 16-20 days, playing at 4-5 weeks, and follow their mother at twelve weeks of age. Milk teeth are fully erupted by 42-49 days and permanent dentition is complete by 175-195 days. In captivity females may breed when they are a year old. Males show sign of sexual activity at 9-10 months, but may not mate successfully until established in home range. The young disperse when they are from 4-5 months to ten months old. Wildcats are full-grown by 18-19 months of age.","In Asia, CITES Appendix II. In Europe, CITES Appendix II. Listed as species of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, with subspecies grampia Vulnerable. In Africa, show tolerance to wide range of environmental conditions and may have benefited from agricultural activities that increased rodent densities. Have historically been trapped in Asia in large numbers for the fur trade, but currently there appears to be little international trade in their pelts. Their population status in most of Asia is not known, but in some areas is reported to be rare. An estimated 90% of its habitat in India has reportedly been lost. Are killed for raiding poultry sheds, and some are killed by domestic dogs. Threats in Europe include fragmentation of habitats and exposure to toxic agricultural chemicals and domestic cat diseases. Persecution and hunting for fur are still important causes of mortality in some areas,e.g., in eastern Europe and Scotland . Road accidents are also a significant cause of mortality. In a study in eastern Scotland , 42% of mortality was due to human causes, mostly persecution and road accidents. On all three continents, the biggest threat to the species is hybridization with domestic cats. This has produced a significant hybrid swarm in some areas (e.g., Scotland ). It is unclear whether hybridization will ultimately result in the loss of the genetic integrity of the species, but it has affected legal protection in Scotland .","Amori et al.

Descriptive notes. Wildcats are found in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and their size, coat color, and pattern of markings vary somewhat from continent to continent. In Africa the size range is: head-body 40.6-66. 5 cm , tail 24.1-36. 8 cm ; weight 2.4-6. 4 kg . Asiatic Wildcats tend to weigh less than their African counterparts: head-body 47-74 cm,tail 21:9-36 cm; weight 2-6 kg. The following measurements are recorded from Europe: head-body 54.7-65. 5 cm (males), 47.3-57. 5 cm (females), tail 27.6-32. 6 cm (males), 25.7-32 cm (females); weight 3-77.7-26 kg (males), 2-35—4-68 kg (females).

Secretive, and most reports suggest they are strictly nocturnal, although in areas where undisturbed sometimes seen in early morning and late afternoon. In Pakistan reportedly shelter underground or in dense cover during the heat of the day and emerge at night to hunt. In Turkmenistan described as crepuscular, but in Uzbekistan found active at any time of the day in all seasons. In the northern part of their European range, often also active during daylight in winter, butstrictly nocturnal in summer. May remain inactive for up to 28 hours during heavy snowfall or rain and strong winds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Little known of social habits in Africa, most sightings are of solitary animals. Anecdotal information suggests animals are highly territorial. The home range of a radio-collared adult male in Kenya was 1-6 km? over the short time followed. In contrast, the home ranges of a radio-tagged male and female Wildcat in the United Arab Emirates measured 28-7 km2 and 52-7 km2, respectively. While the male’s range was smaller than that of the female, he was only tracked for 1-5 months compared to 14 months for the female. The male did, however, travel farther per night than the female, 8-64 km/night and 4-86 km/night, respectively. Over the 14 months she was tracked, the female was located to 42 dens, all of which were burrows made by Red Foxes. In Asia, also, outside of mating associations, are solitary. In south-west Tajikistan the area used for hunting was thought to cover about 3—4 km ?. In a steppe habitat of Uzbekistan , two animals occupied an area of 10 km ?. In eastern Scotland , where rabbits were abundant, mean annual home range size was 1-75 km? for both sexes; in western Scotland , where rabbits were scarce, home ranges were much larger (9-10 km? for males and 8-10 km* for females). Home ranges of males in Scotland may overlap with one or more of those of females, but there is usually little intrasexual overlap. Social groupings comprise mostly mothers with kittens, but also dispersing siblings and males with females in estrus. Communication mainly by scent marking, including spraying urine and depositing feces in prominent places near trails on trees, vegetation, and boulders. Feces may be combined with anal sacgland secretions. Trees and saplings may be scratched using forepaws, leaving a visual marker and an olfactory sign from interdigital gland secretion. Breeding. Mating is noisy, marked by much screeching and yowling. In the northern Sahara, breed in winter. In southern and East Africa, small young found in all months of the year, but tend to be born during the wet season, which coincides with peaks in rodent abundance. In Central Asia, mating takes place in January-February, and in Rajasthan, in November-December and March-April. In southern Sind , Pakistan , breeding may occur at any season of the year. The female is in heat for about four days; ovulation occurs a day after copulation. Wildcats are induced ovulators. Females come into estrus every six weeks unless conception occurs. Gestation lasts from 56 to 65 days. Typically two or three kittens (maximum five) born, furred and blind, in a wellconcealed location. Kittens have been found in hollow trees, underground burrows, rocky crevices, and dense grass. The young first emerge from the natal den at one month and are weaned and introduced to hunting between 3—4 months. In captivity, a female introduced her young to live prey when they were 60 days old, and two days later, the male kittens were killing mice on their own. By the fourth day the female kitten did likewise. In the wild a female was seen bringing injured gerbils to the den for her young to try to kill. Kittens are independent by 5-6 months. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months and males at about twelve months. In captivity, signs of sexual activity were observed in a female who was just over nine months of age and gave birth to a single kitten ( 80 g ) when was eleven months old. In the wild a female born in April was pregnant when caught in late January. In captivity two year-old males attempted to mate with a female who was showing signs of coming into estrus, but in the wild the testes of males were not developed until the cats were 21-22 months of age. In Europe most mating occurs January-March, although the breeding season may extend December—July. Estrus lasts for 2-9 days; if no conception occurs, recycle in about 14 days. Most births occur in April and May after a gestation period of 60-68 days, but births may extend March—-August. Usually only one litter per year, but may have a second if a litteris lost early. Litter sizes in capitivity range from 1-8 (average of 3-4) and in the wild, from 1-7. At birth, kittens weigh 65-163 g (and usually do not survive at less than 90 g ). Lactation lasts for 6-7 weeks but may continue sporadically for up to four months. The eyes open at 7-13 days, the kittens begin walking at 16-20 days, playing at 4-5 weeks, and follow their mother at twelve weeks of age. Milk teeth are fully erupted by 42-49 days and permanent dentition is complete by 175-195 days. In captivity females may breed when they are a year old. Males show sign of sexual activity at 9-10 months, but may not mate successfully until established in home range. The young disperse when they are from 4-5 months to ten months old. Wildcats are full-grown by 18-19 months of age. Status and Conservation. In Asia, CITES Appendix II. In Europe, CITES Appendix II. Listed as species of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, with subspecies grampia Vulnerable. In Africa, show tolerance to wide range of environmental conditions and may have benefited from agricultural activities that increased rodent densities. Have historically been trapped in Asia in large numbers for the fur trade, but currently there appears to be little international trade in their pelts. Their population status in most of Asia is not known, but in some areas is reported to be rare. An estimated 90% of its habitat in India has reportedly been lost. Are killed for raiding poultry sheds, and some are killed by domestic dogs. Threats in Europe include fragmentation of habitats and exposure to toxic agricultural chemicals and domestic cat diseases. Persecution and hunting for fur are still important causes of mortality in some areas,e.g., in eastern Europe and Scotland . Road accidents are also a significant cause of mortality. In a study in eastern Scotland , 42% of mortality was due to human causes, mostly persecution and road accidents. On all three continents, the biggest threat to the species is hybridization with domestic cats. This has produced a significant hybrid swarm in some areas (e.g., Scotland ). It is unclear whether hybridization will ultimately result in the loss of the genetic integrity of the species, but it has affected legal protection in Scotland . Bibliography. Amori et al.

On following pages: 4. Tiger ( Panthera tigris ).","P. u. uncia Schreber, 1775 — C Asia NE to Mongolia and Russia . P.u. uncioides Horsfield, 1855 — W China , and the Himalayas.","Head-body 86-125 cm, tail 80-105 cm; weight 22-52 kg; adult males are larger than adult females. Fur is long and thick: in winter it may be 5 cm long on the back and sides and almost 12 cm long on the belly. Long fur gives the cat a rather stocky appearance. Background color of the fur varies from smoky-gray to grayish buff and the coat is marked with dark gray and black rosettes and spots. The pattern of spots and rosettes on each cat is unique. Centers of rosettes are usually darker than the background coat color. Chest and underparts are whitish. Adapted for living at high altitudes in mountainous terrain, the Snow Leopard has moderately long, powerful limbs, well-developed chest muscles and large, broad feet. The long, thick tail functions as a balancing aid while the cats are moving about in precipitous terrain. Snow Leopards are also known to be prodigious leapers. The skull has a short muzzle and a high domed forehead to accommodate the expanded nasal cavities. Ears are short, rounded, and set wide apart; the backs of the ears are light-colored and rimmed with black.","Snow Leopards inhabit rugged and remote mountainous areas where the terrain is broken by steep cliffs, ridges, and ravines. The cat’s habitat is typically high rocky areas, alpine meadows, alpine steppe scrub, and high altitude forests. They generally spend the summer above tree line at elevations of 2700 to 6000 m , but in winter deep snow often forces wild ungulates to move to lower elevations and the Snow Leopards follow. The cats have also been found in isolated mountain massifs in Mongolia , and to reach these sites they would have had to traverse 20 to 65 km of broad, flat, open terrain.","Snow Leopards are capable of killing prey as much as three times their own weight. A large percentage oftheir diet consists of mountain-dwelling sheep and goats. Major prey species include bharal ( Pseudois ), Himalayan Tahr ( Hemitragus jemlahicus), Markhor ( Capra falconeri), Siberian Ibex ( Capra sibirica), Argali ( Ovis ammon), and Urial sheep (Quis orientalis). In some areas wild asses (Equus), musk deer, Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), and gazelles are also taken. Smaller prey such as marmots, pikas, hares and rabbits, pheasants, and voles are important food items, especially in summer. One estimate suggests that as much as 45% of the meat in a Snow Leopard’s summer diet may come from marmots. The cat also preys on domestic sheep, goats, cows, horses, yaks, and dogs. An unusual amount of vegetation, especially twigs of Myricaria and Tamarix bushes ( Tamaricaceae ), have been found in Snow Leopard scats, suggesting that these cats deliberately eat plant matter. Snow Leopards hunt by walking animal trails, ridge lines, river terraces, and the beds of deep gorges. They usually avoid open, unbroken terrain. When hunting, they tend to attack from a vantage point above the prey and have been seen pursuing prey across slopes and down mountainsides in chases of 200-300 m. Prey are killed with a bite to the nape or the throat. Carcasses are often moved to avoid attracting the attention of crows and vultures. The cat will remain with the carcass for 3-5 days, or until only bones remain. Captives require about 1-5 kg of meat per day and in the wild an adult blue sheep will provide the cat with food for a week. Females rearing young require about three times the normal amount of food to rear two to three young. One female and her two cubs consumed an adult Bharal in less than 48 hours; a similarsized kill would sustain a single Snow Leopard for 3-5 days. Activity patterns. Snow Leopards are most active at dawn and dusk, but may be found hunting at any time of the day or night. In Mongolia, radio-tagged individuals were active 37% of the time, with the lowest level of activity occurring between12:00 and 18:00 h and the highest between 20:00 and 04:00 h. Where it is not subject to human disturbance the cat often hunts during the daytime. In areas where Snow Leopards feed on domestic animals they tend to hunt mainly at night. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The mean straight-line distance between consecutive daily locations of Snow Leopards in Mongolia was 5 km , but on 18% of these occasions the distance was more than 10 km . The greatest distance traveled was 27.9 km. That Snow Leopards were capable of long-distance movement was also evident when they were located on isolated massifs, which were thought to be used as waypoints when crossing between distant mountain ranges. The cats had to cross 20 to 65 km of flat, open terrain to get to these massifs. The majority of studies on Snow Leopards have been done in areas of good habitat. In these “hotspots,” Snow Leopard ranges are surprisingly small (mean 18-6 km?, range10-7-36-2 km?), but since there were periods when animals could not be located, they were likely moving over larger ranges. In an area of Mongolia with low prey densities the home ranges were much larger. One female with kittens used an area of only 13-5 km?®, but the range of an old female was conservatively estimated at 585 km ? Two males roamed areas of 61-141 km?, but these figures were considered underestimates of their ranges. Snow Leopards communicate mainly by scent marks, which includes feces, urine, and scrapes. Snow Leopards tend to make scrapes along their major travel routes, which include ridgelines, the base of cliffs, and river terraces. Some heavily-used routes are re-marked frequently. In one study area, the heaviest concentration ofscrapes occurred around stream confluences. In addition to making scrapes, both sexes also spray urine on rocks and boulders. They appear to spray sites that are protected from the elements, especially the undersides of overhanging rocks and boulders. In captivity, male Snow Leopards urine-spray more frequently than females, but there is no information on sex differences in marking behavior from the wild. Exceptfor females with young and mating pairs, Snow Leopards are solitary. There have been several observations ofthe cats traveling and hunting in pairs, but radio-tracking studies indicate that these associations are rare. Not surprisingly, only a few density estimates exist. Most suveys show that Snow Leopards typically exist at very low densities but can be locally abundant. In Nepal's Langu Valley the density of adults and subadults was 5-10 animals per 100 km ². In Nepal’s Annapurna Conservation Area, densities reached 5-7 adults per 100 km . In the best Snow Leopard habitat in Ladakh, density estimates vary from 2—4 per 100 km ? Outside these “hotspots,” densities are much lower, approximately 0-5-1 adult per 100 km ².",,"Snow Leopards are most active at dawn and dusk, but may be found hunting at any time of the day or night.

Snow leopards are unusual among the large cats in that they have a welldefined birth peak. Mating occurs from January through March and is marked by a noticeable increase in scent marking and calling. Captive observations indicate that estrus usually lasts from 5-8 days with copulations taking place over 3-6 days. Pairs mate often, 12-36 times per day, and coitus lasts 15-45 seconds. The young are born after a gestation period of 94-103 days. Litter size varies from 1-5, with an average of 2:2. Cubs are born in a cave or rock crevice and weigh 320-567 g. A thick, woolly natal coat helps insulate the young from the cold. For the first week after the young are born, females remain at or near the den, grooming, nursing, and resting. The young gain weight rapidly, putting on 300-500 g per week. By two months of age, they weigh about 4 kg , and by ten weeks they are weaned and weigh about 6 kg . Cubs begin following their mother sometime between 2—4 months of age. During this phase they may be more a hindrance than a help to their mother while she is hunting. Cubs are nutritionally dependent on their motherfor a relatively long time—possibly as long as 18 months. In captivity Snow Leopards become sexually mature at 2-3 years of age, but rarely breed before they are four years old.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Fully protected over most of its geographic range. Status surveys indicate that Snow Leopardslive at low densities throughout their geographic range, but in localized areas where prey abundance is high the cats may occur at relatively high densities. The global Snow Leopard population is estimated at 4080-6590 individuals. The major threat to the Snow Leopard is loss of natural prey and conflict with herders over depredation on domestic stock. In areas where Snow Leopards and shepherds live side by side, domestic livestock often form an important part of the Snow Leopards’ winter diet. Many Snow Leopards are killed each year in retaliation for stock raiding. The Snow Leopard’s prey is subject to fairly intense hunting by humansacross the cat’s range. Large-scale pika and marmot poisoning programs have depleted populations of these important but smaller prey items. At one time there was a fairly substantial demand for Snow Leopard skins from the fur trade, and in the 1920s approximately 1000 pelts a year were traded in the world fur markets. High quality fur coats made of Snow Leopard skins once fetched US $ 50,000 each. It is no longer legal to export Snow Leopard pelts, but coats and furs are still seen occasionally in shops in Nepal , China , and Taiwan . Thereis also some demand for Snow Leopard bones for use in the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) trade. A variety of coordinated efforts are underway to conserve Snow Leopards in the wild. These include compensation schemes for livestock losses and strengthening local conservation institutions through training and support. The International Snow Leopard Trust is currently offering incentives to people to protect local wildlife and helping them find better ways to manage their livestock. In addition, efforts are being made to establish a network of conservation areas across the cat’s range.","Ahlborn & Jackson (1988) | Blomqvist & Nystrom (1980) | Blomqvist & Sten (1982) | Chundawat & Rawat (1994) | Fox (1994) | Fox & Chundawat (1988) | Freeman (1980, 1983) | Freeman et al.

Recent analyses of morphological and genetic variation in Tigers suggests little evidence for subspecies differentiation. Eight subspecies are recognized historically, but three races are extinct: balica (Schwarz, 1912) from Bali, sondaica (Temminck, 1844) from Java, and virgata (Illiger, 1815) from the river valleys of the Takla Makan, western slopes of the Tian Shan Mountains, Amu Darya and Syr Darya river valleys, shores of the Caspian Sea, Elburz Mountains, and Tigris and Euphrates river valleys. A new subspecies from Peninsular Malaysia (jacksoni) has been recently proposed, butit has never been described properly and its taxonomic validity is still being discussed. Five extant subspecies recognized.","P. t. tigris Linnaeus, 1758 — Indian subcontinent. P. t. altaica Temminck, 1844 — Russian Far East, N Korean Peninsula and NE China . P. t. amoyensis Hilzheimer, 1905 — SC China (could be extinct in the wild). P. t. corbetti Mazak, 1968 — S China ( Yunnan ), S to Indochinese region, and S to the Malay Peninsula. P. t. sumatrae Pocock, 1929 — Sumatra .","Head-body 146-290 cm, tail 72-109 cm; weight 75-325 kg, with considerable regional variation in size. Adult males from Sumatra may weigh 100-140 kg, females 75-110 kg. On average, adult males from Nepal are 100 kg heavier and females 50 kg heavier than their counterparts in Sumatra. Few documented weights exceeding 300 kg , and total length (nose to tip oftail) of three meters or more appear to be exceptional individuals. Background coat color varies from a dark red to a pale yellow and variation also seen in darkness of stripes and stripe pattern. General trend is for Tigers from South-east Asia to have darker ground color and more stripes, while Tigers from northern areas are paler and have fewerstripes. Fur is short in most parts of its range, but winter pelage of Tigers from Russian Far East is thick and long, adding to appearance of great size. Tigers from India are highly variable in coat color and pattern of markings. Markings on head and flanks are individually unique. No melanistic skins or museum specimens exist, but there are three records of black Tigers from the same general area of north-east India and Bangladesh . The last record of white Tigers in India was a male cub captured in the forests of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh , in 1951. All the white Tigers in captivity are descendants of this male; they are not albinos but the result of a mutation that occurred about 100 years ago. Tigers are the largest of the living felids, embodying power and grace. Head is large and foreshortened, increasing the bite force on the large canine teeth. Neck is short, thick, and shoulders and forearms are massive, with long, retractile claws on the broad forepaws. Morphology is specialized for single-handed capture and killing of large prey. Stand about one meter high at the shoulder; hindquarters are slightly lower. Body is long and lithe and the tail is typically less than half the head-body length.","Tigers are found in a great variety of habitat types. In Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan the Tiger was found in the drainage basins ofrivers and lakes, where they hunted in the “tugai,” which consists of thickets of low-stature trees (turanga, tamarisk), shrubs, and dense reed beds. In Kazakhstan Tigers sometimes ascended into montane forests in the summer in pursuit of Wild Boar, attaining heights of 2500 m . There are also records of Tigers in the Himalayas at altitudes of almost 4000 m , although in most areas the cats remain well below 2000 m . In China they occupied grass thickets, montane sub-tropical evergreen forests, and mixed forests dominated by oak and poplars. Tigers in the Russian Far East live in low mountainous terrain dominated by nut pine, birch, oaks, fir, and spruce. Winterin this region is harsh, with deep snow and temperatures dropping to —34°C. In Sumatra and Malaysia Tigers are found in lowland humid tropical rainforest, where precipitation exceeds 2000 mm annually. In the outwash areas south of the Himalayas Tigers inhabit the “terai”, a belt of floodplain habitat dominated by marshes, swamps, oxbow lakes, and tall, dense grasslands intermixed with riverine forest. Sal forest, a climax form of moist deciduous forest, occurs on the slopes of the adjacenthills. In India Tigers inhabit the tropical, wet evergreen, and semi-evergreen forests of Assam , the mangrove swamps of West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh , the vast expanses of dry deciduous forest in the central plateau, the tropical moist and dry deciduous forests of the Western Ghats, and the thorn forests of Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Ranthambhore National Park, Rajasthan, Tigers also use the ancient temples and fortresses as places to lie up during the day.","The list of prey species found as kills or in Tiger scats (feces) is extensive, but across its vast geographic range the Tiger's diet consists largely of deer and pigs. Over a b4year period in Sikhote-Alin, Russia , Red Deer ( Cervus elaphus) and Wild Boar were the dominant prey, representing 437 of 522 kills (84%). Minor prey included Moose ( Alces alces), Siberian Roe Deer ( Capreolus pygargus), and Sika Deer ( Cervus nippon), Siberian Musk Deer (Moschus moschiferus), and Long-tailed Goral ( Naemorhedus caudatus). Surprisingly, the kill records included a small number of adult Brown and Asiatic Black Bears. There is little information available on the food habits of Tigers in South-east Asia, but in a sample (n = 38) of Tiger scats from Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand , muntjac were the dominant prey (42%). Sambar Deer (7%) and Wild Boar (9%) occurred relatively infrequently in scats, whereas smaller prey such as porcupines, Hog Badgers, primates, and lizards collectively occurred in 28% of scats. The diet of Tigers in Royal Bardia National Park, Nepal , was reconstructed from an analysis of 215 scats collected over a 5year period. Three species, Chital ( Axis axis), Wild Boar, and Hog Deer ( Axis porcinus), contributed more than 90% of the biomass consumed. Several other species, including langur monkeys, Nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus), Barasingha ( Rucervus duvaucelii), and porcupine occurred infrequently in scats. Larger ungulates such as the Nilgai and Barasingha were not killed preferentially, probably due to their low densities. Wild Boar were taken out of proportion to their availability, although Tiger predation was heaviest on the incredibly abundant (over 200/km?) Chital. Based on an analysis of 472 scats, Tigers in Nagarhole National Park, India , preyed selectively on the largest prey available, the Gaur ( Bos frontal) and Sambar, whereas smaller prey such as Chital, Red Muntjac ( Muntiacus muntjak), and Wild Boar were underrepresented in the diet. These five prey species together provided about 96% of the biomass consumed by Tigers. Among the larger prey species, Tiger predation was biased towards adult male Sambar, Chital, and Wild Boar, and young Gaur. Minor prey identified in scats included Indian Spotted Chevrotain (Moschiola), hare, porcupine, Dhole, and primates. Based on the scat data, the average weight of prey taken by Tigers in Nagarhole was 91 kg . In contrast, the average weight based solely on kills was 400 kg ; however, because large kills are more likely to be found, this method grossly overestimates the average weight of prey taken. It does indicate, however, that Tigers are capable of taking extremely large prey, including adult male Gaur that may weigh 1000 kg . Tigers are solitary, stalk-and-ambush hunters and they actively search for prey. Habitat features that attract ungulates, such as water holes and the edges of small clearings, are favorite hunting spots. Stalking cover is important: a Tiger will attempt to get as close as possible to its prey before making a final rush, relying on quickly overtaking prey rather than pursuit for long distances. The tiger catches hold of the prey with its claws and holds and kills its prey with a bite from the large canine teeth. Small prey, or those weighing half that of the Tiger, are typically killed with a bite to the nape, with the canines separating the vertebrae and breaking the spinal cord. Large prey are most often killed with a throat bite, leading to strangulation or neck breakage due to twisting on impact. Except for adult Gaur, Tigers in Nagarhole killed their prey where cover density was significantly higher than that of leopard kills. Adult Gaur were killed in areas with significantly less cover, suggesting that attacks on Gaur in dense cover were extremely risky. Tigers in Nagarahole also took advantage of the cover of darkness; about 27% of kills were made between 06:00-09:00 h and the remainder were made between 18:00-06:00 h. Large kills such as Gaur may be too heavy to be moved, but if there is insufficient cover at the kill site the Tiger will drag its kill to an area where it feels secure before beginning to feed. Drag distances may be a few meters or several kilometers, and individual temperament may also influence this behavior. Feeding usually begins on the hindquarters or rump and once the body cavity is opened the stomach is removed and set aside. The carcass is then dragged a short distance before feeding resumes. Tigers use their carnassial or blade-like cheek teeth to slice off large hunks of meat and the rough tongue is used to rasp flesh from bones. The amount of meat consumed can be substantial: one adult male Tiger in Chitwan ate 32 kg in a single night and there are other reports of Tigers consuming 20% of their body weight in a night’s feeding. Tigresses in Chitwan spent an average of three days with each kill and during that time consumed 46 kg of meat. However, even large kills may notlast long if several Tigers are feeding on the carcass. For example,a tigress in Chitwan and her two large young fed on an adult Sambar for two days, consuming 102 kg of meat or about 17 kg per Tiger per day. Tigers often rest near the carcass, feeding intermittently, but if the Tiger leaves it will typically cover the remains, raking leaves, grass, dirt, or even rocks over the carcass. There is little information on kill rates, but tigresses in Chitwan without dependent young killed a large prey animal about every eight or nine days, which translates to 40 to 46 kills per year. Females with dependent young have to kill more often or kill larger prey to meet the nutritional demands of growing offspring. Activity patterns. Radio-tracking studies indicate that Tigers are essentially crepuscular and nocturnal. Activity patterns appear to be driven primarily by activity patterns of the prey. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In Nagarhole National Park, India , the rates of movements of radio-collared Tigers were lower during the daytime (mean = 0-07 km/h) than at night (mean = 0-21 km/h). Radio-collared tigresses in Chitwan National Park, Nepal , traveled about 0-7 km/h (range 0-2-1-2 km/h); estimates of the distances traveled in a night by females varied from 3-8 to 9-6 km. These estimates are based on straight-line distances between hourly nighttime locations, so the actual distances traveled would be somewhat greater. On some occasions tigresses crossed their ranges in a single night, while at other times they remained in a portion ofit for several days. However, except when they had a kill or young, tigresses in Chitwan normally choose a different rest site each day. Adult females typically occupy relatively small, mutually exclusive territories. The ranges of adult males may also be exclusive, but each male attempts to include as many female ranges as possible within his range, and thus male ranges can vary enormously in size. In Chitwan National Park, Nepal , the average home range size of resident females was 23 km ? (range 13-51 km?); overlap of neighboring ranges varied from 3-7-7-1%. These territories function to ensure that females have exclusive access to food, cover, and other resources needed for survival and the successful rearing of young. Females who did not hold territories did not breed. Site fidelity was strong; females spent their entire reproductive lives in these territories, although some females shifted so that part of their range was acquired by their daughters. The tendency for daughters to try to settle next to their mothers resulted in clusters of females that were on average as closely related as lionesses in a pride. Breeding territories of males were established by direct takeovers and sometimes expanded after fights with neighboring males. The average home range size of resident males in Chitwan was 68 km ? (range 24 to 151 km ?*). Males who did not hold territories did not breed. Turnover rates of territorial males were high. The average reproductive life was 2-8 years, but ranged from seven months to 6-3 years. The ranges of resident males overlapped the ranges of two to seven resident females. The home range size of Tigers, especially females,is positively correlated with the abundance of prey, and consequently the density of adult Tigers living in an area is also related to prey biomass density. In the temperate forests of the Russian Far East, Tiger density is estimated at 0-5-1-4/ 100 km ?, but prey biomass density is low ( 400 kg /km? in Sikhote-Alin) and range size of tigresses (200-400 km?) are an order of magnitude larger than those in Chitwan. Prey biomass density in Chitwan is about 2000 kg /km® and Tiger density on the alluvial floodplain is about 8/ 100 km ®. The highest Tiger density reported, 16-8/ 100 km ?, is from Kaziranga National Park in north-east India . Kaziranga is an alluvial floodplain grassland that supports one of the highest densities of large prey on the subcontinent. Common ungulate prey in Kaziranga include wild Water Buffalo ( Bovidae ), Barasingha, Hog Deer, Red Muntjac ( Cervidae ), Wild Boar, and Gaur ( Bovidae ). High Tiger density (14-7/ 100 km ²) is also reported from the moist deciduous forests of Nagarhole National Park in south India , where prey biomass densities are estimated at 7500 kg /km². The lowest Tiger densities are reported from the lowland tropical rain forests of Peninsular Malaysia , Sumatra, and Laos , where prey densities are typically less than 500 kg /km².",,Radio-tracking studies indicate that Tigers are essentially crepuscular and nocturnal.

The lowest Tiger densities are reported from the lowland tropical rain forests of Peninsular Malaysia , Sumatra, and Laos , where prey densities are typically less than 500 kg /km². Breeding. In subtropical and tropical areas Tigers mate and give birth at any time of the year, but in temperate areas such as the Russian Far East, young are more likely to be born in the spring. Estrus is preceded by an increase in scent marking, which probably ensures that a male is present when the female is sexually receptive. In captivity, the average length of estrus is five days. In the wild pairs were seldom found together for more than two days, although prolonged associations may be related to inexperience. Courtship in Tigers is risky and familiarity appears to be an important prelude to mating. Once the female is ready to mate copulations occur frequently (e.g.17-52 times/day). Females are thought to be induced ovulators; that is, they require a certain number of copulations within a limited time period to stimulate ovulation. Conception rates are low, about 20 to 40%, and if conception does not occur the female will come into heat again in about a month. Following a gestation of about 103 days the female gives birth to one to seven young. In Nepal , mean litter size for 49 litters was 2:98 (range 2-5); litters were born in all months except February. Birth dens have been found in impenetrable thickets, shallow depressions in dense grass areas, rock crevices, and caves. Kittens are born with eyes closed, helpless, weighing 785 to 1610 g , but they quadruple their birth weight in a month. During the first month of the cubs’ lives the tigress spends most of her time at the den and her home range contracts to a small area focused on the den site. Her home range gradually expands as the young become mobile at two to three months of age. At four months of age a Tiger cub is the size of a setter dog. By six months the cubs are weaned, but lack the ability to kill for themselves. The permanent canines appear between twelve and 18 months of age, and this marks a period of rapid weight gain as the young are now physically equipped to make their own kills. They must, however,still refine their hunting techniques and learn to kill efficiently. Male cubs learn to kill on their own and become independent sooner than their female siblings, and by 15 months of age they may begin spending some time away from their mother. By 18-20 months young Tigers are typically independent of their mothers but continue to hunt in their natal range. Dispersal occurs when young are 18-28 months old and it seems to be keyed to the arrival of a new litter. In Chitwan the interbirth interval varied from 20 to 24 months (mean 21-6 months). The average dispersal distance for ten subadult males in Chitwan was 33 km (range 9-5-65 km), but the average for four females was only 9-7 km (range 0-2-33 km). However, only four of the ten males managed to establish breeding territories whereas all four females did. Mean age offirst reproduction for females was 3-4 years, and for males it was 4-8 years (range 3-4-6-8 years). Average reproductive life span of females was 6-1 years, but two females in the park had reproductive life spans of 10-5 and 12-5 years, and during this time reared four and five litters, respectively. These females were exceptional: the mean lifetime reproduction of females was 4-54 young surviving to dispersal age and 2-0 that survived to breed. One extraordinary male, who managed to maintain exclusive access to seven females for four years, sired 27 offspring that survived to dispersal age. Most males were far less successful; the mean lifetime reproduction of males was 5-83 young surviving to dispersal age and 1-99 young that survived to breed.","CITES Appendix I. Three subspecies (Amur, South China , and Sumatran Tiger) classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Otherwise classified as Endangered. Large range reduction (41% overthe last decade), and an estimated global population of 3402-5140 adult Tigers in the wild, with perhaps half of these residing in India . However a recent tiger census carried out in 2007 stated that the wild tiger population in India has come down to approximately 1411. Another 700-1400 Indo-Chinese Tigerslive in Myanmar , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam , China , and Peninsular Malaysia . There are about 500 Tigers restricted to some forest tracts on Sumatra. Another 400 or so Siberian Tigers live in the Russian Far East, with a few in neighboring China . The Chinese Tiger has almost been extirpated, and no definite evidence of continued persistence exists. The Bali, Javan, and Caspian races are extinct. Tiger populations have declined over many parts of Asia because ofillegal hunting, commercial trade in Tiger bone and derivatives, a declining prey base, and loss and degradation of habitat. Saving the Tiger has become an enormous and complex undertaking, involving efforts by federal, national, and state governments, large corporations, parks and wildlife departments, and non-government organizations. The problem is being attacked on many fronts, including threats of sanctions against countries that do not control trade in Tiger parts, establishing protected reserves, training and deployment of anti-poaching teams, identification of critical conservation units, working with traditional Chinese medical practitioners to find alternatives to Tiger parts, public education campaigns deploring the use Tiger parts, habitat restoration projects, economic incentives to locals, development of suitable survey and monitoring methods, and initiation of baseline ecological research projects. Some of these initiatives have led to recoveries of Tiger populations within a decade in many reserves in India and Nepal , but with expanding human populations in the region the pressures on the natural systems are only going to increase. Fortunately, Tigers are a resilient species and demographic modeling suggests that even relatively small Tiger populations with 6-12 breeding females may be viable over a 100year timeframe. Even small reserves, 300-3000 km?, can potentially support viable Tiger populations if the prey base is intact. However, managing and protecting these areas will require more resources and it will also be important to know which management practices work and which do not.","Bagchi et al. (2003) | Banks et al.

Felis tigris Linnaeus, 1758 , Bengal, India . Recent analyses of morphological and genetic variation in Tigers suggests little evidence for subspecies differentiation. Eight subspecies are recognized historically, but three races are extinct: balica (Schwarz, 1912) from Bali, sondaica (Temminck, 1844) from Java, and virgata (Illiger, 1815) from the river valleys of the Takla Makan, western slopes of the Tian Shan Mountains, Amu Darya and Syr Darya river valleys, shores of the Caspian Sea, Elburz Mountains, and Tigris and Euphrates river valleys. A new subspecies from Peninsular Malaysia (jacksoni) has been recently proposed, butit has never been described properly and its taxonomic validity is still being discussed. Five extant subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. P. t. tigris Linnaeus, 1758 — Indian subcontinent. P. t. altaica Temminck, 1844 — Russian Far East, N Korean Peninsula and NE China . P. t. amoyensis Hilzheimer, 1905 — SC China (could be extinct in the wild). P. t. corbetti Mazak, 1968 — S China ( Yunnan ), S to Indochinese region, and S to the Malay Peninsula. P. t. sumatrae Pocock, 1929 — Sumatra . Descriptive notes. Head-body 146-290 cm, tail 72-109 cm; weight 75-325 kg, with considerable regional variation in size. Adult males from Sumatra may weigh 100-140 kg, females 75-110 kg. On average, adult males from Nepal are 100 kg heavier and females 50 kg heavier than their counterparts in Sumatra. Few documented weights exceeding 300 kg , and total length (nose to tip oftail) of three meters or more appear to be exceptional individuals. Background coat color varies from a dark red to a pale yellow and variation also seen in darkness of stripes and stripe pattern. General trend is for Tigers from South-east Asia to have darker ground color and more stripes, while Tigers from northern areas are paler and have fewerstripes. Fur is short in most parts of its range, but winter pelage of Tigers from Russian Far East is thick and long, adding to appearance of great size. Tigers from India are highly variable in coat color and pattern of markings. Markings on head and flanks are individually unique. No melanistic skins or museum specimens exist, but there are three records of black Tigers from the same general area of north-east India and Bangladesh . The last record of white Tigers in India was a male cub captured in the forests of Rewa, Madhya Pradesh , in 1951. All the white Tigers in captivity are descendants of this male; they are not albinos but the result of a mutation that occurred about 100 years ago. Tigers are the largest of the living felids, embodying power and grace. Head is large and foreshortened, increasing the bite force on the large canine teeth. Neck is short, thick, and shoulders and forearms are massive, with long, retractile claws on the broad forepaws. Morphology is specialized for single-handed capture and killing of large prey. Stand about one meter high at the shoulder; hindquarters are slightly lower. Body is long and lithe and the tail is typically less than half the head-body length. Habitat. Tigers are found in a great variety of habitat types. In Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tajikistan the Tiger was found in the drainage basins ofrivers and lakes, where they hunted in the “tugai,” which consists of thickets of low-stature trees (turanga, tamarisk), shrubs, and dense reed beds. In Kazakhstan Tigers sometimes ascended into montane forests in the summer in pursuit of Wild Boar, attaining heights of 2500 m . There are also records of Tigers in the Himalayas at altitudes of almost 4000 m , although in most areas the cats remain well below 2000 m . In China they occupied grass thickets, montane sub-tropical evergreen forests, and mixed forests dominated by oak and poplars. Tigers in the Russian Far East live in low mountainous terrain dominated by nut pine, birch, oaks, fir, and spruce. Winterin this region is harsh, with deep snow and temperatures dropping to —34°C. In Sumatra and Malaysia Tigers are found in lowland humid tropical rainforest, where precipitation exceeds 2000 mm annually. In the outwash areas south of the Himalayas Tigers inhabit the “terai”, a belt of floodplain habitat dominated by marshes, swamps, oxbow lakes, and tall, dense grasslands intermixed with riverine forest. Sal forest, a climax form of moist deciduous forest, occurs on the slopes of the adjacenthills. In India Tigers inhabit the tropical, wet evergreen, and semi-evergreen forests of Assam , the mangrove swamps of West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh , the vast expanses of dry deciduous forest in the central plateau, the tropical moist and dry deciduous forests of the Western Ghats, and the thorn forests of Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Ranthambhore National Park, Rajasthan, Tigers also use the ancient temples and fortresses as places to lie up during the day. Food and Feeding. The list of prey species found as kills or in Tiger scats (feces) is extensive, but across its vast geographic range the Tiger's diet consists largely of deer and pigs. Over a b4year period in Sikhote-Alin, Russia , Red Deer ( Cervus elaphus) and Wild Boar were the dominant prey, representing 437 of 522 kills (84%). Minor prey included Moose ( Alces alces), Siberian Roe Deer ( Capreolus pygargus), and Sika Deer ( Cervus nippon), Siberian Musk Deer (Moschus moschiferus), and Long-tailed Goral ( Naemorhedus caudatus). Surprisingly, the kill records included a small number of adult Brown and Asiatic Black Bears. There is little information available on the food habits of Tigers in South-east Asia, but in a sample (n = 38) of Tiger scats from Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand , muntjac were the dominant prey (42%). Sambar Deer (7%) and Wild Boar (9%) occurred relatively infrequently in scats, whereas smaller prey such as porcupines, Hog Badgers, primates, and lizards collectively occurred in 28% of scats. The diet of Tigers in Royal Bardia National Park, Nepal , was reconstructed from an analysis of 215 scats collected over a 5year period. Three species, Chital ( Axis axis), Wild Boar, and Hog Deer ( Axis porcinus), contributed more than 90% of the biomass consumed. Several other species, including langur monkeys, Nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus), Barasingha ( Rucervus duvaucelii), and porcupine occurred infrequently in scats. Larger ungulates such as the Nilgai and Barasingha were not killed preferentially, probably due to their low densities. Wild Boar were taken out of proportion to their availability, although Tiger predation was heaviest on the incredibly abundant (over 200/km?) Chital. Based on an analysis of 472 scats, Tigers in Nagarhole National Park, India , preyed selectively on the largest prey available, the Gaur ( Bos frontal) and Sambar, whereas smaller prey such as Chital, Red Muntjac ( Muntiacus muntjak), and Wild Boar were underrepresented in the diet. These five prey species together provided about 96% of the biomass consumed by Tigers. Among the larger prey species, Tiger predation was biased towards adult male Sambar, Chital, and Wild Boar, and young Gaur. Minor prey identified in scats included Indian Spotted Chevrotain (Moschiola), hare, porcupine, Dhole, and primates. Based on the scat data, the average weight of prey taken by Tigers in Nagarhole was 91 kg . In contrast, the average weight based solely on kills was 400 kg ; however, because large kills are more likely to be found, this method grossly overestimates the average weight of prey taken. It does indicate, however, that Tigers are capable of taking extremely large prey, including adult male Gaur that may weigh 1000 kg . Tigers are solitary, stalk-and-ambush hunters and they actively search for prey. Habitat features that attract ungulates, such as water holes and the edges of small clearings, are favorite hunting spots. Stalking cover is important: a Tiger will attempt to get as close as possible to its prey before making a final rush, relying on quickly overtaking prey rather than pursuit for long distances. The tiger catches hold of the prey with its claws and holds and kills its prey with a bite from the large canine teeth. Small prey, or those weighing half that of the Tiger, are typically killed with a bite to the nape, with the canines separating the vertebrae and breaking the spinal cord. Large prey are most often killed with a throat bite, leading to strangulation or neck breakage due to twisting on impact. Except for adult Gaur, Tigers in Nagarhole killed their prey where cover density was significantly higher than that of leopard kills. Adult Gaur were killed in areas with significantly less cover, suggesting that attacks on Gaur in dense cover were extremely risky. Tigers in Nagarahole also took advantage of the cover of darkness; about 27% of kills were made between 06:00-09:00 h and the remainder were made between 18:00-06:00 h. Large kills such as Gaur may be too heavy to be moved, but if there is insufficient cover at the kill site the Tiger will drag its kill to an area where it feels secure before beginning to feed. Drag distances may be a few meters or several kilometers, and individual temperament may also influence this behavior. Feeding usually begins on the hindquarters or rump and once the body cavity is opened the stomach is removed and set aside. The carcass is then dragged a short distance before feeding resumes. Tigers use their carnassial or blade-like cheek teeth to slice off large hunks of meat and the rough tongue is used to rasp flesh from bones. The amount of meat consumed can be substantial: one adult male Tiger in Chitwan ate 32 kg in a single night and there are other reports of Tigers consuming 20% of their body weight in a night’s feeding. Tigresses in Chitwan spent an average of three days with each kill and during that time consumed 46 kg of meat. However, even large kills may notlast long if several Tigers are feeding on the carcass. For example,a tigress in Chitwan and her two large young fed on an adult Sambar for two days, consuming 102 kg of meat or about 17 kg per Tiger per day. Tigers often rest near the carcass, feeding intermittently, but if the Tiger leaves it will typically cover the remains, raking leaves, grass, dirt, or even rocks over the carcass. There is little information on kill rates, but tigresses in Chitwan without dependent young killed a large prey animal about every eight or nine days, which translates to 40 to 46 kills per year. Females with dependent young have to kill more often or kill larger prey to meet the nutritional demands of growing offspring. Activity patterns. Radio-tracking studies indicate that Tigers are essentially crepuscular and nocturnal. Activity patterns appear to be driven primarily by activity patterns of the prey. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In Nagarhole National Park, India , the rates of movements of radio-collared Tigers were lower during the daytime (mean = 0-07 km/h) than at night (mean = 0-21 km/h). Radio-collared tigresses in Chitwan National Park, Nepal , traveled about 0-7 km/h (range 0-2-1-2 km/h); estimates of the distances traveled in a night by females varied from 3-8 to 9-6 km. These estimates are based on straight-line distances between hourly nighttime locations, so the actual distances traveled would be somewhat greater. On some occasions tigresses crossed their ranges in a single night, while at other times they remained in a portion ofit for several days. However, except when they had a kill or young, tigresses in Chitwan normally choose a different rest site each day. Adult females typically occupy relatively small, mutually exclusive territories. The ranges of adult males may also be exclusive, but each male attempts to include as many female ranges as possible within his range, and thus male ranges can vary enormously in size. In Chitwan National Park, Nepal , the average home range size of resident females was 23 km ? (range 13-51 km?); overlap of neighboring ranges varied from 3-7-7-1%. These territories function to ensure that females have exclusive access to food, cover, and other resources needed for survival and the successful rearing of young. Females who did not hold territories did not breed. Site fidelity was strong; females spent their entire reproductive lives in these territories, although some females shifted so that part of their range was acquired by their daughters. The tendency for daughters to try to settle next to their mothers resulted in clusters of females that were on average as closely related as lionesses in a pride. Breeding territories of males were established by direct takeovers and sometimes expanded after fights with neighboring males. The average home range size of resident males in Chitwan was 68 km ? (range 24 to 151 km ?*). Males who did not hold territories did not breed. Turnover rates of territorial males were high. The average reproductive life was 2-8 years, but ranged from seven months to 6-3 years. The ranges of resident males overlapped the ranges of two to seven resident females. The home range size of Tigers, especially females,is positively correlated with the abundance of prey, and consequently the density of adult Tigers living in an area is also related to prey biomass density. In the temperate forests of the Russian Far East, Tiger density is estimated at 0-5-1-4/ 100 km ?, but prey biomass density is low ( 400 kg /km? in Sikhote-Alin) and range size of tigresses (200-400 km?) are an order of magnitude larger than those in Chitwan. Prey biomass density in Chitwan is about 2000 kg /km® and Tiger density on the alluvial floodplain is about 8/ 100 km ®. The highest Tiger density reported, 16-8/ 100 km ?, is from Kaziranga National Park in north-east India . Kaziranga is an alluvial floodplain grassland that supports one of the highest densities of large prey on the subcontinent. Common ungulate prey in Kaziranga include wild Water Buffalo ( Bovidae ), Barasingha, Hog Deer, Red Muntjac ( Cervidae ), Wild Boar, and Gaur ( Bovidae ). High Tiger density (14-7/ 100 km ²) is also reported from the moist deciduous forests of Nagarhole National Park in south India , where prey biomass densities are estimated at 7500 kg /km². The lowest Tiger densities are reported from the lowland tropical rain forests of Peninsular Malaysia , Sumatra, and Laos , where prey densities are typically less than 500 kg /km². Breeding. In subtropical and tropical areas Tigers mate and give birth at any time of the year, but in temperate areas such as the Russian Far East, young are more likely to be born in the spring. Estrus is preceded by an increase in scent marking, which probably ensures that a male is present when the female is sexually receptive. In captivity, the average length of estrus is five days. In the wild pairs were seldom found together for more than two days, although prolonged associations may be related to inexperience. Courtship in Tigers is risky and familiarity appears to be an important prelude to mating. Once the female is ready to mate copulations occur frequently (e.g.17-52 times/day). Females are thought to be induced ovulators; that is, they require a certain number of copulations within a limited time period to stimulate ovulation. Conception rates are low, about 20 to 40%, and if conception does not occur the female will come into heat again in about a month. Following a gestation of about 103 days the female gives birth to one to seven young. In Nepal , mean litter size for 49 litters was 2:98 (range 2-5); litters were born in all months except February. Birth dens have been found in impenetrable thickets, shallow depressions in dense grass areas, rock crevices, and caves. Kittens are born with eyes closed, helpless, weighing 785 to 1610 g , but they quadruple their birth weight in a month. During the first month of the cubs’ lives the tigress spends most of her time at the den and her home range contracts to a small area focused on the den site. Her home range gradually expands as the young become mobile at two to three months of age. At four months of age a Tiger cub is the size of a setter dog. By six months the cubs are weaned, but lack the ability to kill for themselves. The permanent canines appear between twelve and 18 months of age, and this marks a period of rapid weight gain as the young are now physically equipped to make their own kills. They must, however,still refine their hunting techniques and learn to kill efficiently. Male cubs learn to kill on their own and become independent sooner than their female siblings, and by 15 months of age they may begin spending some time away from their mother. By 18-20 months young Tigers are typically independent of their mothers but continue to hunt in their natal range. Dispersal occurs when young are 18-28 months old and it seems to be keyed to the arrival of a new litter. In Chitwan the interbirth interval varied from 20 to 24 months (mean 21-6 months). The average dispersal distance for ten subadult males in Chitwan was 33 km (range 9-5-65 km), but the average for four females was only 9-7 km (range 0-2-33 km). However, only four of the ten males managed to establish breeding territories whereas all four females did. Mean age offirst reproduction for females was 3-4 years, and for males it was 4-8 years (range 3-4-6-8 years). Average reproductive life span of females was 6-1 years, but two females in the park had reproductive life spans of 10-5 and 12-5 years, and during this time reared four and five litters, respectively. These females were exceptional: the mean lifetime reproduction of females was 4-54 young surviving to dispersal age and 2-0 that survived to breed. One extraordinary male, who managed to maintain exclusive access to seven females for four years, sired 27 offspring that survived to dispersal age. Most males were far less successful; the mean lifetime reproduction of males was 5-83 young surviving to dispersal age and 1-99 young that survived to breed. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Three subspecies (Amur, South China , and Sumatran Tiger) classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Otherwise classified as Endangered. Large range reduction (41% overthe last decade), and an estimated global population of 3402-5140 adult Tigers in the wild, with perhaps half of these residing in India . However a recent tiger census carried out in 2007 stated that the wild tiger population in India has come down to approximately 1411. Another 700-1400 Indo-Chinese Tigerslive in Myanmar , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam , China , and Peninsular Malaysia . There are about 500 Tigers restricted to some forest tracts on Sumatra. Another 400 or so Siberian Tigers live in the Russian Far East, with a few in neighboring China . The Chinese Tiger has almost been extirpated, and no definite evidence of continued persistence exists. The Bali, Javan, and Caspian races are extinct. Tiger populations have declined over many parts of Asia because ofillegal hunting, commercial trade in Tiger bone and derivatives, a declining prey base, and loss and degradation of habitat. Saving the Tiger has become an enormous and complex undertaking, involving efforts by federal, national, and state governments, large corporations, parks and wildlife departments, and non-government organizations. The problem is being attacked on many fronts, including threats of sanctions against countries that do not control trade in Tiger parts, establishing protected reserves, training and deployment of anti-poaching teams, identification of critical conservation units, working with traditional Chinese medical practitioners to find alternatives to Tiger parts, public education campaigns deploring the use Tiger parts, habitat restoration projects, economic incentives to locals, development of suitable survey and monitoring methods, and initiation of baseline ecological research projects. Some of these initiatives have led to recoveries of Tiger populations within a decade in many reserves in India and Nepal , but with expanding human populations in the region the pressures on the natural systems are only going to increase. Fortunately, Tigers are a resilient species and demographic modeling suggests that even relatively small Tiger populations with 6-12 breeding females may be viable over a 100year timeframe. Even small reserves, 300-3000 km?, can potentially support viable Tiger populations if the prey base is intact. However, managing and protecting these areas will require more resources and it will also be important to know which management practices work and which do not. Bibliography. Bagchi et al.

There is considerable regional variation in body size and weight. Adult Leopards from Cape Province , South Africa , are among the smallest, with mean weight of males at 30-9 kg and females at 21-2 kg. However, adult males weighing 50 to 60 kg are reported from many regions of the Leopard’s range. Background coat color varies from bright golden yellow to a pale yellow to rusty-reddish yellow, depending on region. Underparts are white. Hair is short and coarse in cats from warmer climates, but winter coat of Leopards from Russian Far Eastis soft, long (3-7 cm), and dense. Black spots are found on head, neck, shoulders, limbs, and hindquarters. Black spots form broken circles or rosettes on sides and back. The rosettes typically lack a black spot in center, as seen on the Jaguar. Melanistic Leopards are known from several regions of Africa, but there is a much higher frequency of black Leopards from Thailand , Malaysia , and Java. Tail is relatively long, more than half the head-body length, and covered with dark spots, bands, and blobs; tip is black above and white below. Backs of ears are white on upper half and dark below. Pattern of markings on coat, head, and muzzle are individually unique.","As might be predicted from its broad geographic distribution, Leopards are able to live in almost every type of habitat. In sub-Saharan Africa the cats are found in all habitats that have an annual rainfall above 50 mm . They are also found in true deserts, but only where river courses extend into this otherwise inhospitable habitat. In the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa , Leopards inhabit arid, open-dune sandveld with scattered shrubs and trees. They escape the intense midday heat by sheltering in porcupine or aardvark burrows. Tracking studies in the Kalahari have shown that Leopards can survive without drinking for as long as ten days. In other hot, dry deserts such as the Namib, Sahara, Sinai, and Arabian, Leopards also use caves, burrows, or the shade of dense vegetation to survive daytime temperatures that may reach 70°C. In other parts of Africa Leopards occur in the wetter habitats, including savannas, acacia grasslands, evergreen and deciduous forests, and scrub woodlands. They also occur in the rain forest habitats of Central and West Africa, where annual rainfall typically exceeds 1500 mm . Leopards are common throughout the Indian subcontinent, from the moist deciduous, teak, and shola forests of the Western Ghats to the dry, deciduous, bamboo, and mixed forests of the rugged tableland in central India . In the north they live in sal forest and the tall grasslands on the outwash plains of the Himalaya as well as in the mountainous terrain of Pakistan and Kashmir to 5200 m . In Myanmar , Thailand , Peninsular Malaysia , and Java the cats are found in dense, primary rain forest and a variety of other forest types. In the Russian Far East Leopards inhabit mountainous forested regions. They prefer broken topography with Korean pine and second growth oak forest. In this area, a key limiting factor is snow depth. The cats prefer habitats where the average long-term snow cover does not exceed 15 cm . Whatever type of habitat they live in, Leopards are often able to persist in close proximity to people, as long as they are not persecuted and have access to secure den sites. Remarkably, three Leopards were discovered living in an abandoned engine at the railroad station in Kampala , Uganda . In India it is not uncommon to read newspaper accounts ofvillagers finding leopards hiding in sheds and outbuildings.","Leopards are adaptable generalists, able to survive on an extraordinary variety of large or small prey. In many areas the cat’s diet consists largely of small to medium-sized mammals (5-45 kg), but even ungulates weighing two to three times the cat’s body weight are occasionally taken. Leopards can also survive on extremely small prey, an ability that allows them to live in areas from which larger prey has long since been extirpated. The cat has a truly catholic diet, taking an incredible variety of different prey sizes and types. At least 92 prey species are known from the Leopard’s diet in sub-Saharan Africa. Where Leopards live near villages their diet often includes dogs, cats, sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. A large number of sheep or goats can be killed in a single incident when a Leopard findsitself in a pen with a frightened flock. The Leopard’s fondness for dogs is well known and there are many accounts of family pets or village dogs disappearing in the night. Food habit studies from different parts of the Leopard’s geographic distribution illustrates the cat’s adaptability. In the Serengeti, Impala ( Aepyceros melampus) and Thompson's Gazelles ( Eudorcas thomsonii) are the principal prey, but other bovids (Bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus, Common Reedbuck Redunca redunca, Blue Wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, Grant's Gazelle Nanger granti, Topi Damaliscus korrigum, Hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus) are also taken. Less frequently taken prey incude Common Warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), Burchell’s Zebra (Equus burchellir), hyrax, spring hare, baboons, birds, and small carnivores. Impala are also the dominant prey (78% ofkills) in Kruger National Park, although the cats occasionally prey on other bovids (Bushbuck, Reedbuck, Blue Wildebeest, Waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, Kudu Tragelaphus strepisceros, Nyala 1. angasii, Common Tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus, Common Eland Tawrotragus oryx, Sable Antelope Hippotragus niger, and African Buffalo Syncerus caffer). In the Kalahari, Springbok ( Antidorcas marsupialis) is the most important prey (65% of kills), but duikers, Steenbok ( Raphicerus campestris), Blue Wildebeest, Hartebeest, and Gemsbok ( Oryx gazella) are also taken. Incidental prey included small carnivores, birds, rodents, Cheetahs, Aardwolves, and Aardvarks. Duikers were the most important prey in north-east Namibia ; Steenbok ranked second. A variety of other carnivorous animals were also killed, including Aardwolf, Cheetah, Genet, Bat-eared Fox, Wildcat, and python. A major difference in the diets of African Leopardsis that cats from tropical rain forests take signifi cantly more primates. In the Ituri Forest, Zaire , primates comprised 25% of prey items in Leopard scats. Of 13 species of diurnal anthropoid primates in the area, remains of at least eleven species were identified in scats. Arboreal guenons, mangabeys, and colobines ( Cercopithecidae ) were taken in proportion to their abundance, but predation on ['Hoest’s Monkey ( Cercopithecus lhoesti), a terrestrial species, was much greater than expected based on their availability. Despite the increased percentage of primates in the diets of Ituri Forest Leopards, their principal prey was medium-sized ungulates. In the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast , primate remains were found in 25% of scats; Leopards killed at least eight species of primate (Ceropithecidae, Lorisidae ). Duikers were the dominant prey in the park, but bushpigs (Potamochoerus), Forest Hogs (Hylochoerus meinerizhageni), porcupines, pangolins, hyrax, Water Chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), and rodents were also taken. Leopards in Asia prey largely on small to mediumsized ungulates. In Nagarhole National Park, India , Chital, muntjac, and Sambar ( Cervidae ) were found in 656% of scats; the remains of Gaur and Four-horned Antelope ( Tetracerus quadricornis), Wild Boar, and chevrotain were found in 19% of scats. Incidental prey included primates, hares, porcupines, and Dhole. The small (15-20 kg) muntjac was the dominant prey (43%) in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand . Primates ranked second (11%) in scats, followed by porcupines (10%). Less frequently occurring prey included Sambar, Wild Boars, Hog Badgers, pangolins, rodents, birds, lizards, and crabs. In Wolong Reserve, China , Tufted Deer ( Elaphodus cephalophus) are the principal prey (41%). Musk deer, Sambar, Wild Boar, and several species of bovids (Serow Capricornis, Takin Budorcas taxicolor, Goral Naemorhedus ) were taken occasionally. Surprisingly, rodents were the second most frequently occurring prey (17%) in scats. The remains of a Red Panda and a Giant Panda were each found in a scat. In the Russian Far East more than half of the Leopard's diet consists of Siberian Roe Deer. Secondary prey include Siberian Musk Deer, Sika Deer, Wild Boar, hare, badger, Raccoon Dog, and pheasants. Leopards locate their prey primarily by sight and sound, and they spend considerable time looking and listening for prey as they walk slowly about their home ranges. Having detected an animal, the Leopard will stalk it, preferring to get as close as possible before launching an attack. Alternatively, it will lie in ambush, waiting for the prey to come close enough to attack. Adult prey are rarely pursued, although young, inexperienced animals are sometimes chased for considerable distances. Most hunting is done at night, taking advantage of the cover of darkness, and what little information is available suggests hunting success is higher at night. Leopards occasionally hunt during the daytime, but typically only in areas with dense cover. Few people have actually observed Leopards trying to capture an animal. In Kruger National Park, Leopards were unsuccessful on thirteen daytime attempts, but two attempts at night were both successful. In the Serengeti National Park, only one of nine and three of sixty-four daytime attempts to capture prey were successful. Like otherlarge felids, Leopards commonly kill large prey with a bite to the throat. Small prey are usually dispatched with a bite to the nape or back of the head. Leopards go to great lengths to avoid losing their kills to scavengers and larger predators. They will drag carcasses hundreds of meters to get to areas with dense cover or to cache kills in trees. Hauling a carcass into a tree involves a great feat of strength. One Leopard managed to haul a 125 kg giraffe calf up into a tree to a height of 5-7 m. The habit of caching kills in trees appears to be more common in Africa, where large carnivores such as Lions and hyenas will quickly steal kills from the smaller and less powerful leopard. In the Serengeti, Leopard kills stored in trees lasted about four times longer than similarsized kills stored on the ground. How often a Leopard kills depends on variables such as size of prey, seasonal changes in cover, individual differencesin levels of experience, and reproductive constraints. Leopards in Kruger National Park killed on average about one Impala per week. The longest interval between kills of large prey was 19 days. In the Serengeti, where Thompson's Gazelles were the principal prey, Leopards made a kill about every five to six days. A female Leopard in South Africa’s Londolozi Game Reserve was seen with 28 kills weighing more than 10 kg in 330 days, or about one kill every 11-8 days. The kill rates in Kruger were slightly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, which was thought to be related to the increased density of stalking cover following the onset of the rains. Males in Kruger killed a large prey animal about once every 7-2 days compared to once every 7-5 days for females without young. In the Kalahari Desert, male Leopards made a kill about every three days, compared to once every 1-5 days for females with cubs. As the interval between kills got longer, Leopards in the Kalahari increased the distances they traveled each day to increase contact rates with prey. Females in north-east Namibia without young made a kill about once every 5-5-6 days, whereas females with dependent young made a kill every 3-9—4-4 days. Although the kill rate was not much higher for females with young, they did kill larger prey, resulting in a greater per capita food intake. The amount of meat consumed varies, depending on the size of the prey, how much meat is lost to scavengers, and the percentage of carcass that is inedible. Estimates of consumption vary from 4.7-3. 1 kg /day for adult male Leopards in Kruger to 2-9 kg/day for adult females in the same area. Leopards in captivity are maintained on about 1-2 to 2-6 kg/ day, but they surely have less caloric demands than animals in the wild. Activity patterns. In most areas where Leopards have been studied the cats are largely nocturnal. In Sri Lanka , where they are the only large carnivore, they are commonly sighted in open habitats during the daytime, suggesting that their activity patterns are influenced by the presence of other large carnivores. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Few studies have actually monitored the movements of Leopards, but in the interior dune areas of the Kalahari Desert, males traveled an average of 14-3 km/day. Females with cubs averaged 13-4 km/day. The maximum distances traveled by males were 27-3 km per day (non-mating period) and 33 km /day (mating period). The maximum distance traveled by a female with cubs was 24-6 km/day. In more productive habitats the distances traveled per day are considerably less. Leopards in Tsavo National Park averaged 2-6 km/day (range 0-9-4-2 km/day) and in the South-west Cape Province the distances traveled by three males were usually less than 3 km /day. There is great variation in home range sizes of Leopards. In high-quality habitats females can meet their needs within relatively small areas. The home range of an adult female living on the prey-rich floodplain of Nepal's Chitwan National Park measured only 8 km ? while the ranges of two females living along the edge of the park were 6-13 km*. In Kruger National Park, females living in riparian habitats had similarly small ranges, averaging about 14-8 km*. The ranges of resident females on a livestock ranch in Kenya were about 14 km ®. Male ranges in these areas were two to three times larger than female ranges. The year-round home ranges of two female Leopards in the Russian Far East were 33 and 62 km ?*; a male’s range was at least 280 km ?. In areas of extremely low prey density, female ranges of 128 to 487 km ? have been reported. The home range of a male in the interior dune area of the Kalahari Desert was estimated at 800 km ®. Leopardsare solitary, and outside of mating the only long-term association is a female and her young. Each male’s range usually overlaps the range of one or more adult females. The larger male ranges will often include areas ofless productive habitats; females compete for the best areas, because habitats with abundant resources enhance their reproductive success. In some parts of Africa, long-term sightings of individually-recognizable Leopards suggest that females are philopatric, in that daughters tend to establish ranges next to their mothers’. Density estimates of leopards vary from a low of 0-6/ 100 km ® in the interior dune area of the Kalahari Desert to 30-3/ 100 km ? in the riparian forest areas of Kruger National Park. Estimates of 3-5 to 12:5/ 100 km ? appear to be more common.",,"In most areas where Leopards have been studied the cats are largely nocturnal.

Estimates of 3-5 to 12:5/ 100 km ? appear to be more common. Breeding. Zoo records show that females may come into estrus at any time of the year and they remain in heat for one to two weeks. In the wild mating associations are brief, lasting only one or two days. Young are born after a gestation period of about 96 days. Litter size varies from 1-3, but there are records of females having as many as six cubs. Most litters consist of two young. Females use caves, rocky outcrops, abandoned burrows, or dense thickets for birth dens. For the first few days after the cubs are born the mother spends practically all her time at the den, resting and nursing the young. Later, when she leaves to hunt, she may be away from the den site for 24-36 hours. Leopard cubs are very vulnerable to predation during this time. Most cub mortality occurs during the first few months of life. Older cubs are also left unattended for long periods of time. Studies in north-east Namibia found that three-month-old cubs were left for periods of one to seven days while their mother hunted. Young generally begin traveling with their mother when they are about three months old and weigh 3-4 kg. There are records of five-month old cubs killing hares and other small animals, but more commonly this coincides with the appearance of their permanent canines at about 7-8 months of age. By the time Leopards are 12-18 months of age, the young are usually independent of their mother, but the timing of dispersal varies from 15 to 36 months. Sexual maturity is attained by two to three years of age.","CITES Appendix I.

Descriptive notes. Head-body 92-190 cm,tail 64-99 cm; weight 21-71 kg. Adult males are larger than adult females. There is considerable regional variation in body size and weight. Adult Leopards from Cape Province , South Africa , are among the smallest, with mean weight of males at 30-9 kg and females at 21-2 kg. However, adult males weighing 50 to 60 kg are reported from many regions of the Leopard’s range. Background coat color varies from bright golden yellow to a pale yellow to rusty-reddish yellow, depending on region. Underparts are white. Hair is short and coarse in cats from warmer climates, but winter coat of Leopards from Russian Far Eastis soft, long (3-7 cm), and dense. Black spots are found on head, neck, shoulders, limbs, and hindquarters. Black spots form broken circles or rosettes on sides and back. The rosettes typically lack a black spot in center, as seen on the Jaguar. Melanistic Leopards are known from several regions of Africa, but there is a much higher frequency of black Leopards from Thailand , Malaysia , and Java. Tail is relatively long, more than half the head-body length, and covered with dark spots, bands, and blobs; tip is black above and white below. Backs of ears are white on upper half and dark below. Pattern of markings on coat, head, and muzzle are individually unique. Habitat. As might be predicted from its broad geographic distribution, Leopards are able to live in almost every type of habitat. In sub-Saharan Africa the cats are found in all habitats that have an annual rainfall above 50 mm . They are also found in true deserts, but only where river courses extend into this otherwise inhospitable habitat. In the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa , Leopards inhabit arid, open-dune sandveld with scattered shrubs and trees. They escape the intense midday heat by sheltering in porcupine or aardvark burrows. Tracking studies in the Kalahari have shown that Leopards can survive without drinking for as long as ten days. In other hot, dry deserts such as the Namib, Sahara, Sinai, and Arabian, Leopards also use caves, burrows, or the shade of dense vegetation to survive daytime temperatures that may reach 70°C. In other parts of Africa Leopards occur in the wetter habitats, including savannas, acacia grasslands, evergreen and deciduous forests, and scrub woodlands. They also occur in the rain forest habitats of Central and West Africa, where annual rainfall typically exceeds 1500 mm . Leopards are common throughout the Indian subcontinent, from the moist deciduous, teak, and shola forests of the Western Ghats to the dry, deciduous, bamboo, and mixed forests of the rugged tableland in central India . In the north they live in sal forest and the tall grasslands on the outwash plains of the Himalaya as well as in the mountainous terrain of Pakistan and Kashmir to 5200 m . In Myanmar , Thailand , Peninsular Malaysia , and Java the cats are found in dense, primary rain forest and a variety of other forest types. In the Russian Far East Leopards inhabit mountainous forested regions. They prefer broken topography with Korean pine and second growth oak forest. In this area, a key limiting factor is snow depth. The cats prefer habitats where the average long-term snow cover does not exceed 15 cm . Whatever type of habitat they live in, Leopards are often able to persist in close proximity to people, as long as they are not persecuted and have access to secure den sites. Remarkably, three Leopards were discovered living in an abandoned engine at the railroad station in Kampala , Uganda . In India it is not uncommon to read newspaper accounts ofvillagers finding leopards hiding in sheds and outbuildings. Food and Feeding. Leopards are adaptable generalists, able to survive on an extraordinary variety of large or small prey. In many areas the cat’s diet consists largely of small to medium-sized mammals (5-45 kg), but even ungulates weighing two to three times the cat’s body weight are occasionally taken. Leopards can also survive on extremely small prey, an ability that allows them to live in areas from which larger prey has long since been extirpated. The cat has a truly catholic diet, taking an incredible variety of different prey sizes and types. At least 92 prey species are known from the Leopard’s diet in sub-Saharan Africa. Where Leopards live near villages their diet often includes dogs, cats, sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. A large number of sheep or goats can be killed in a single incident when a Leopard findsitself in a pen with a frightened flock. The Leopard’s fondness for dogs is well known and there are many accounts of family pets or village dogs disappearing in the night. Food habit studies from different parts of the Leopard’s geographic distribution illustrates the cat’s adaptability. In the Serengeti, Impala ( Aepyceros melampus) and Thompson's Gazelles ( Eudorcas thomsonii) are the principal prey, but other bovids (Bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus, Common Reedbuck Redunca redunca, Blue Wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, Grant's Gazelle Nanger granti, Topi Damaliscus korrigum, Hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus) are also taken. Less frequently taken prey incude Common Warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), Burchell’s Zebra (Equus burchellir), hyrax, spring hare, baboons, birds, and small carnivores. Impala are also the dominant prey (78% ofkills) in Kruger National Park, although the cats occasionally prey on other bovids (Bushbuck, Reedbuck, Blue Wildebeest, Waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, Kudu Tragelaphus strepisceros, Nyala 1. angasii, Common Tsessebe Damaliscus lunatus, Common Eland Tawrotragus oryx, Sable Antelope Hippotragus niger, and African Buffalo Syncerus caffer). In the Kalahari, Springbok ( Antidorcas marsupialis) is the most important prey (65% of kills), but duikers, Steenbok ( Raphicerus campestris), Blue Wildebeest, Hartebeest, and Gemsbok ( Oryx gazella) are also taken. Incidental prey included small carnivores, birds, rodents, Cheetahs, Aardwolves, and Aardvarks. Duikers were the most important prey in north-east Namibia ; Steenbok ranked second. A variety of other carnivorous animals were also killed, including Aardwolf, Cheetah, Genet, Bat-eared Fox, Wildcat, and python. A major difference in the diets of African Leopardsis that cats from tropical rain forests take signifi cantly more primates. In the Ituri Forest, Zaire , primates comprised 25% of prey items in Leopard scats. Of 13 species of diurnal anthropoid primates in the area, remains of at least eleven species were identified in scats. Arboreal guenons, mangabeys, and colobines ( Cercopithecidae ) were taken in proportion to their abundance, but predation on ['Hoest’s Monkey ( Cercopithecus lhoesti), a terrestrial species, was much greater than expected based on their availability. Despite the increased percentage of primates in the diets of Ituri Forest Leopards, their principal prey was medium-sized ungulates. In the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast , primate remains were found in 25% of scats; Leopards killed at least eight species of primate (Ceropithecidae, Lorisidae ). Duikers were the dominant prey in the park, but bushpigs (Potamochoerus), Forest Hogs (Hylochoerus meinerizhageni), porcupines, pangolins, hyrax, Water Chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), and rodents were also taken. Leopards in Asia prey largely on small to mediumsized ungulates. In Nagarhole National Park, India , Chital, muntjac, and Sambar ( Cervidae ) were found in 656% of scats; the remains of Gaur and Four-horned Antelope ( Tetracerus quadricornis), Wild Boar, and chevrotain were found in 19% of scats. Incidental prey included primates, hares, porcupines, and Dhole. The small (15-20 kg) muntjac was the dominant prey (43%) in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand . Primates ranked second (11%) in scats, followed by porcupines (10%). Less frequently occurring prey included Sambar, Wild Boars, Hog Badgers, pangolins, rodents, birds, lizards, and crabs. In Wolong Reserve, China , Tufted Deer ( Elaphodus cephalophus) are the principal prey (41%). Musk deer, Sambar, Wild Boar, and several species of bovids (Serow Capricornis, Takin Budorcas taxicolor, Goral Naemorhedus ) were taken occasionally. Surprisingly, rodents were the second most frequently occurring prey (17%) in scats. The remains of a Red Panda and a Giant Panda were each found in a scat. In the Russian Far East more than half of the Leopard's diet consists of Siberian Roe Deer. Secondary prey include Siberian Musk Deer, Sika Deer, Wild Boar, hare, badger, Raccoon Dog, and pheasants. Leopards locate their prey primarily by sight and sound, and they spend considerable time looking and listening for prey as they walk slowly about their home ranges. Having detected an animal, the Leopard will stalk it, preferring to get as close as possible before launching an attack. Alternatively, it will lie in ambush, waiting for the prey to come close enough to attack. Adult prey are rarely pursued, although young, inexperienced animals are sometimes chased for considerable distances. Most hunting is done at night, taking advantage of the cover of darkness, and what little information is available suggests hunting success is higher at night. Leopards occasionally hunt during the daytime, but typically only in areas with dense cover. Few people have actually observed Leopards trying to capture an animal. In Kruger National Park, Leopards were unsuccessful on thirteen daytime attempts, but two attempts at night were both successful. In the Serengeti National Park, only one of nine and three of sixty-four daytime attempts to capture prey were successful. Like otherlarge felids, Leopards commonly kill large prey with a bite to the throat. Small prey are usually dispatched with a bite to the nape or back of the head. Leopards go to great lengths to avoid losing their kills to scavengers and larger predators. They will drag carcasses hundreds of meters to get to areas with dense cover or to cache kills in trees. Hauling a carcass into a tree involves a great feat of strength. One Leopard managed to haul a 125 kg giraffe calf up into a tree to a height of 5-7 m. The habit of caching kills in trees appears to be more common in Africa, where large carnivores such as Lions and hyenas will quickly steal kills from the smaller and less powerful leopard. In the Serengeti, Leopard kills stored in trees lasted about four times longer than similarsized kills stored on the ground. How often a Leopard kills depends on variables such as size of prey, seasonal changes in cover, individual differencesin levels of experience, and reproductive constraints. Leopards in Kruger National Park killed on average about one Impala per week. The longest interval between kills of large prey was 19 days. In the Serengeti, where Thompson's Gazelles were the principal prey, Leopards made a kill about every five to six days. A female Leopard in South Africa’s Londolozi Game Reserve was seen with 28 kills weighing more than 10 kg in 330 days, or about one kill every 11-8 days. The kill rates in Kruger were slightly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, which was thought to be related to the increased density of stalking cover following the onset of the rains. Males in Kruger killed a large prey animal about once every 7-2 days compared to once every 7-5 days for females without young. In the Kalahari Desert, male Leopards made a kill about every three days, compared to once every 1-5 days for females with cubs. As the interval between kills got longer, Leopards in the Kalahari increased the distances they traveled each day to increase contact rates with prey. Females in north-east Namibia without young made a kill about once every 5-5-6 days, whereas females with dependent young made a kill every 3-9—4-4 days. Although the kill rate was not much higher for females with young, they did kill larger prey, resulting in a greater per capita food intake. The amount of meat consumed varies, depending on the size of the prey, how much meat is lost to scavengers, and the percentage of carcass that is inedible. Estimates of consumption vary from 4.7-3. 1 kg /day for adult male Leopards in Kruger to 2-9 kg/day for adult females in the same area. Leopards in captivity are maintained on about 1-2 to 2-6 kg/ day, but they surely have less caloric demands than animals in the wild. Activity patterns. In most areas where Leopards have been studied the cats are largely nocturnal. In Sri Lanka , where they are the only large carnivore, they are commonly sighted in open habitats during the daytime, suggesting that their activity patterns are influenced by the presence of other large carnivores. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Few studies have actually monitored the movements of Leopards, but in the interior dune areas of the Kalahari Desert, males traveled an average of 14-3 km/day. Females with cubs averaged 13-4 km/day. The maximum distances traveled by males were 27-3 km per day (non-mating period) and 33 km /day (mating period). The maximum distance traveled by a female with cubs was 24-6 km/day. In more productive habitats the distances traveled per day are considerably less. Leopards in Tsavo National Park averaged 2-6 km/day (range 0-9-4-2 km/day) and in the South-west Cape Province the distances traveled by three males were usually less than 3 km /day. There is great variation in home range sizes of Leopards. In high-quality habitats females can meet their needs within relatively small areas. The home range of an adult female living on the prey-rich floodplain of Nepal's Chitwan National Park measured only 8 km ? while the ranges of two females living along the edge of the park were 6-13 km*. In Kruger National Park, females living in riparian habitats had similarly small ranges, averaging about 14-8 km*. The ranges of resident females on a livestock ranch in Kenya were about 14 km ®. Male ranges in these areas were two to three times larger than female ranges. The year-round home ranges of two female Leopards in the Russian Far East were 33 and 62 km ?*; a male’s range was at least 280 km ?. In areas of extremely low prey density, female ranges of 128 to 487 km ? have been reported. The home range of a male in the interior dune area of the Kalahari Desert was estimated at 800 km ®. Leopardsare solitary, and outside of mating the only long-term association is a female and her young. Each male’s range usually overlaps the range of one or more adult females. The larger male ranges will often include areas ofless productive habitats; females compete for the best areas, because habitats with abundant resources enhance their reproductive success. In some parts of Africa, long-term sightings of individually-recognizable Leopards suggest that females are philopatric, in that daughters tend to establish ranges next to their mothers’. Density estimates of leopards vary from a low of 0-6/ 100 km ® in the interior dune area of the Kalahari Desert to 30-3/ 100 km ? in the riparian forest areas of Kruger National Park. Estimates of 3-5 to 12:5/ 100 km ? appear to be more common. Breeding. Zoo records show that females may come into estrus at any time of the year and they remain in heat for one to two weeks. In the wild mating associations are brief, lasting only one or two days. Young are born after a gestation period of about 96 days. Litter size varies from 1-3, but there are records of females having as many as six cubs. Most litters consist of two young. Females use caves, rocky outcrops, abandoned burrows, or dense thickets for birth dens. For the first few days after the cubs are born the mother spends practically all her time at the den, resting and nursing the young. Later, when she leaves to hunt, she may be away from the den site for 24-36 hours. Leopard cubs are very vulnerable to predation during this time. Most cub mortality occurs during the first few months of life. Older cubs are also left unattended for long periods of time. Studies in north-east Namibia found that three-month-old cubs were left for periods of one to seven days while their mother hunted. Young generally begin traveling with their mother when they are about three months old and weigh 3-4 kg. There are records of five-month old cubs killing hares and other small animals, but more commonly this coincides with the appearance of their permanent canines at about 7-8 months of age. By the time Leopards are 12-18 months of age, the young are usually independent of their mother, but the timing of dispersal varies from 15 to 36 months. Sexual maturity is attained by two to three years of age. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I.

Shoulder height 107-123 cm; weight 190 (150-225 kg; record 272 kg ) for males, and 126 (122-192 kg) for females. The Lions of the Asian subspecies persica are in general smaller. Brown amber to clear cream-colored iris. Eyes edged with white underneath. Coat of adults is generally a uniform sandy or tawny on the upperparts and flanks and white on the underparts. Some adults retain the rosettes and spots characteristic of young lions to a lesser or greater degree, even into their later years. Backs of rounded ears are black,tail is just over half the length of head and body, with well-developed tuft of long tawny to black hairs on the tip concealing a horny spur. Melanistic forms are extremely rare, very pale individuals known from Kaokoland, Namibia , and south-west Botswana . Some nearly white individuals, not albinos, from Timbavati, north-east South Africa . Hair on face, upper body parts, flanks and tail is short, on underparts softer and longer. Adult males have a mane of long hair (up to 16 cm ) on the sides of the face and on top of the head, extending onto the shoulder, around the neck, and for a short distance along the spine. In sub-adults mane color is sandy, yellowish, or tawny, but may change to black with advancing age. Adult Lions lacking manes occur in the Tsavo region, Tanzania , and elsewhere uncommonly. The mane serves as a sexual signal to females and distinguishes the male at great distances. It is also an indicator of individual fitness: mane development is strongly influenced by testosterone. Some adult males have tufts of long hair on the elbows and a long band of hair extending from the mane over the chest to the anterior part of the abdomen. In the extinct North African nominate subspecies this covered the whole belly. Long whitish whiskers are arranged in parallel rows on the sides of the upperlip, each arising from a black spot, but with the top row of spots without whiskers. Recognition of individuals from this pattern of spots is possible. The massive skull is relatively flat on top. The distinguishing morphological character of the remaining Asian Lions, rarely seen in African Lions, is a longitudinal fold of skin along their bellies. Male Asiatic Lions have only moderate mane growth on top of the head, so that their ears are alwaysvisible.","Lions have a wide habitat tolerance. They are not found in dense lowland forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin, but will penetrate deep into desert, especially along avenues of watercourses. They are common in semi-desert areas. They will drink when water is available, but are not dependent on it, getting their moisture requirements from their prey and even plants (tsamma melon in the Kalahari Desert). Optimal habitat appears to be open woodlands and thick bush, scrub, and grass complexes, providing ample supply of food in the form of medium to large-sized ungulates, some shade for resting in the heat of the day, and the barest of cover to facilitate stalking of prey. Range up to 4000 m in Ethiopia . The Lion formerly ranged from North Africa through south-west Asia, where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years, west into Europe, where it became extinct almost 2000 years ago, and east into India . Lions survived in the central Saharan Desert on the edge of the Air Mountains until about 60 years ago.","Mediumto large-sized ungulates make up the bulk of their diet, but Lions are generalists, taking a large variety of vertebrates from mice to young rhinos, Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius), and African Elephants (Loxodonta africana), birds up to the size of an ostrich (Struthio camelus), as well as reptiles,fish, and even insects. Major large ungulate species include a large variety of bovids like African Buffalo, Blue Wildebeest, Hartebeest, Waterbuck, Kob ( Kobus kob), Sable Antelope, Gemsbok , eland, Impala, Springbok, as well as Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), warthog, and zebra in Africa, and deer as well as a high percentage oflivestock in Asia. Individual differences in prey selection and killing techniques are discernible in different prides in the same area, indicating that learning plays a strong role in the Lion’s hunting behavior; i.e. hunting of Brown Fur Seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) on the Namibian coast. In the Serengeti 30% of stalks were successful when members of the pride took part, against 17-19% when only a single individual was involved. Lions do not take account of wind direction when stalking prey; however, they will often try to cut prey off by running ahead of it. Speeds of 45-60 km/h may be achieved in a rush for up to a few hundred meters (usually not more than 100-200 m). The attack is delivered to the rump or shoulders, with the weight of the Lions often bringing the prey to the ground. Sometimes the prey’s neck is broken in falling. As soon as the prey is down it is seized by the throat or muzzle to effect strangulation. The Lions feed at the site of the kill or drag it to the nearest cover. The belly is ripped open and the stomach and intestines pulled out. Lions, especially males, frequently scavenge, acquiring up to 53% of food items in the open plains of the Serengeti this way. This figure decreases to 5% in more arid environments, where prey occurs at lower density. However, in the woodlands of Kruger National Park, male Lions acquire most of their food by hunting rather than scavenging. In Kruger the main prey of male Lions was African Buffalo; females fed on the most abundant medium-sized ungulates, such as Blue Wildebeest and Burchell’s Zebra. Lions will watch vultures descending on kills of other predators. Protection of kills against Spotted Hyenas,is greatly enhanced by the presence of a male. Females may lose up to 20% of their kills to Spotted Hyenas and a further 17% to unrelated Lions. In the absence of their normal prey, Lions can cause grave losses to cattle and small stock, or may even become “man-eaters”. The individuals involved are not always old and decrepit. Activity patterns. Lions usually hunt at night, but there are exceptions. Major hunting peaks usually occur between 02:00 h and 04:00 h, but in Etosha, most hunts occurred from 21:30-22:30 h. In Botswana’s Chobe National Park, Lions seem to be most successful on moonless nights. Hunting levels may be increased during storms, when noise, wind, and waving vegetation make it difficult for prey to detect Lions. They will sleep and rest, usually in compact groups, for long periods when satiated. They avoid exerting themselves during the heat of the day. Although a terrestrial species, they are good climbers and will sometimes drape themselves along branches of trees to take advantage of cool breezes and avoid flies or dangerous animals. Resting periods are interrupted by short periods of intense activity when hunting or exhibiting aggression. Their roar can, under optimal conditions, be heard from as far as 5 km away, appears to serve to demarcate territory, and may be individually distinctive. Prides often indulge in communal roaring. They also use scats, urine spraying, and scrapes for demarcation. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Mostly sedentary but some populations follow migratory prey seasonally. Some individuals nomadic, especially males and subadults. In the arid savanna of Etosha National Park Lions move a mean 13-2 km in 24 hours; in the S Kalahari an average 15-2 km (range 11-34 km). In contrast, Serengeti Lions averaged 4-5-6-5 km in 24 hours. Pride home range size varies from 25-226 km?, but can be considerably larger in low prey density areas, e.g., Etosha National Park, with up to 2075 km ®. In some areas there is an overlap of home ranges but in others ranges are largely exclusive, and actively defended, meriting the term territories. Whether ranges are defended appears to be dependent on the local movement of prey species. Average emigration/mortality of pride Lions in Etosha National Park was 17%. Core unit of the Lions’ matriarchial society is the pride, which consists of a group of related females, none dominant, and their cubs. Pride size, measured by the number of adult females, varies from a minimum average of 2-2 in very arid environments to an average of 4-6, up to eight in year-round high prey-density areas like the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania . Maximum pride size was 39. Subspecies persica has on average smaller prides of 2-5 females. Prides are “fission-fusion” social units. Membership is stable, but pride members are often scattered in small subgroups throughout the pride’s range, and each member spends considerable time alone. Female pride members display several cooperative behaviors unique among felids, giving birth in synchrony, raising cubs communally, with allosuckling of cubs and cooperative hunting. Males, for the short time they are living together with females, concentrate their energy on defending their tenure over the pride(s). In Etosha males only participated in 4% of 461 hunting opportunities, in the Serengeti in only 3%, but more recent studies show that males elsewhere are efficient hunters, tackling especially large and dangerous prey like Buffalo. Prides often divide into smaller sub-groups when foraging. In some regions there is a complex division of labor among lionesses. Some, often larger and heavier individuals, repeatedly play the role of “center”, and others the role of “wing”, chasing the prey towards the “center”. A single male or coalition of up to seven males holds tenure over one or more prides, and effectively excludes strange males from siring cubs with pride females. The average tenure is only 2-3 years. Only in exceptional cases do male Lions breed with related pride females. Coalition males in preand post-tenure periods hunt and scavenge cooperatively. Larger coalitions of 4-6 males can maintain tenure more than twice as long as 1-2 males. Coalitions of more than four males are always related, but pairs frequently consist of unrelated males. Despite maternal defense, infanticide is common when males take over a new pride. Most females with dependent cubs lose their cubs within a month of takeover, and pregnant females lose the cubs shortly after giving birth. In this way, males assure paternity during their short reproductive lifetime. Females show a burst of heightened sexual activity for about three months following a takeover, attracting other males and encouraging competition. This ensures that the fittest coalition is able to gain tenure. Females remain infertile during this “testing” phase, and afterwards, when tenure has stabilized, tend to breed in synchrony. Litters born synchronously have a higher survival rate and tend to show a sex ratio biased towards males.

Breeding. Largely aseasonal, but with birth peaks in certain regions. Courtship initiated by either member of pair; pair remain in close association during the mating period. The male follows the female at all times and rests with her. Female invites copulation by lordosis. Other males of the coalition are tolerated close by, and sometimes there are even multiple-mate copulations, but strange lions are driven off. At least one member of male coalitions larger than two fails to breed successfully, but through kin selection, related non-breeding helpers still benefit. Pair may copulate every 15 minutes, with copulation lasting up to one minute. Mating lasts over a period of several hours and also through the night. Between copulations the pair will lie down next to each other or walk together until the next mating. During copulation the female purrs loudly and towards the end the male may gently neckbite the female. The majority of matings do not result in pregnancy; of 14 observed mating periods only four resulted in fertilization. Lions are polyestrous, estrus lasting 4-16 days, interestrus interval varying from a few days to over a year, on average 16 days, gestation mean of 110 days (range 100-114). Litter size averages 2-5-3, range 1-6, but 89% is 1-4. The mean interbirth interval is 20 months (range 11-25) if previous litter survives to maturity, or 4-6 months if previous litter was lost. For parturition females leave their pride for 4-8 weeks. Mass at birth is about 1-5 kg. Females rejoin the pride with their 4-8 week-old cubs; any female with milk will allow suckling. Cubs will suckle regularly for 6-7 months, suckling less after seven months and discontining by twelve months. They remain with their mothers for 21-30 months and grow rapidly for the first three years. Cub mortality is high, with a 40-50% survival rate, depending on food supply and pride takeover. Young Lions learn to hunt by watching the adults in the pride, and leave their natal pride at the age of 24-42 months. Males reach sexual maturity at 26 months, but only get the opportunity to mate when they are about five years old, and usually only during their pride tenure. Female become pregnantfor the first time at about 43 months of age and continue to breed until they are about 15 years old, producing a litter every two years. On following pages: 7. Jaguar ( Panthera onca ).","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Vulnerable on The [UCN Red List. There are no sound estimates of the total number of Lions in Africa. Most recent data range from 16,500 to 30,000. They occur throughout most of Africa, but are increasingly restricted to protected areas. They are of great social-economic value for trophy hunting, game viewing, and negatively as stock-raiders. Man eating Lions are also a problem, especially in Tanzania . Recent increase in reintroduction of Lions into smaller fenced reserves. Hunting restricted to “problem” animals in most places, in some countries prohibited but in others no legal protection.

Descriptive notes. Head-body 172-250 cm (males), 158-192 cm (females), tail 61-100 cm. Shoulder height 107-123 cm; weight 190 (150-225 kg; record 272 kg ) for males, and 126 (122-192 kg) for females. The Lions of the Asian subspecies persica are in general smaller. Brown amber to clear cream-colored iris. Eyes edged with white underneath. Coat of adults is generally a uniform sandy or tawny on the upperparts and flanks and white on the underparts. Some adults retain the rosettes and spots characteristic of young lions to a lesser or greater degree, even into their later years. Backs of rounded ears are black,tail is just over half the length of head and body, with well-developed tuft of long tawny to black hairs on the tip concealing a horny spur. Melanistic forms are extremely rare, very pale individuals known from Kaokoland, Namibia , and south-west Botswana . Some nearly white individuals, not albinos, from Timbavati, north-east South Africa . Hair on face, upper body parts, flanks and tail is short, on underparts softer and longer. Adult males have a mane of long hair (up to 16 cm ) on the sides of the face and on top of the head, extending onto the shoulder, around the neck, and for a short distance along the spine. In sub-adults mane color is sandy, yellowish, or tawny, but may change to black with advancing age. Adult Lions lacking manes occur in the Tsavo region, Tanzania , and elsewhere uncommonly. The mane serves as a sexual signal to females and distinguishes the male at great distances. It is also an indicator of individual fitness: mane development is strongly influenced by testosterone. Some adult males have tufts of long hair on the elbows and a long band of hair extending from the mane over the chest to the anterior part of the abdomen. In the extinct North African nominate subspecies this covered the whole belly. Long whitish whiskers are arranged in parallel rows on the sides of the upperlip, each arising from a black spot, but with the top row of spots without whiskers. Recognition of individuals from this pattern of spots is possible. The massive skull is relatively flat on top. The distinguishing morphological character of the remaining Asian Lions, rarely seen in African Lions, is a longitudinal fold of skin along their bellies. Male Asiatic Lions have only moderate mane growth on top of the head, so that their ears are alwaysvisible. Habitat. Lions have a wide habitat tolerance. They are not found in dense lowland forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin, but will penetrate deep into desert, especially along avenues of watercourses. They are common in semi-desert areas. They will drink when water is available, but are not dependent on it, getting their moisture requirements from their prey and even plants (tsamma melon in the Kalahari Desert). Optimal habitat appears to be open woodlands and thick bush, scrub, and grass complexes, providing ample supply of food in the form of medium to large-sized ungulates, some shade for resting in the heat of the day, and the barest of cover to facilitate stalking of prey. Range up to 4000 m in Ethiopia . The Lion formerly ranged from North Africa through south-west Asia, where it disappeared from most countries within the last 150 years, west into Europe, where it became extinct almost 2000 years ago, and east into India . Lions survived in the central Saharan Desert on the edge of the Air Mountains until about 60 years ago. Food and Feeding. Mediumto large-sized ungulates make up the bulk of their diet, but Lions are generalists, taking a large variety of vertebrates from mice to young rhinos, Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius), and African Elephants (Loxodonta africana), birds up to the size of an ostrich (Struthio camelus), as well as reptiles,fish, and even insects. Major large ungulate species include a large variety of bovids like African Buffalo, Blue Wildebeest, Hartebeest, Waterbuck, Kob ( Kobus kob), Sable Antelope, Gemsbok , eland, Impala, Springbok, as well as Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), warthog, and zebra in Africa, and deer as well as a high percentage oflivestock in Asia. Individual differences in prey selection and killing techniques are discernible in different prides in the same area, indicating that learning plays a strong role in the Lion’s hunting behavior; i.e. hunting of Brown Fur Seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) on the Namibian coast. In the Serengeti 30% of stalks were successful when members of the pride took part, against 17-19% when only a single individual was involved. Lions do not take account of wind direction when stalking prey; however, they will often try to cut prey off by running ahead of it. Speeds of 45-60 km/h may be achieved in a rush for up to a few hundred meters (usually not more than 100-200 m). The attack is delivered to the rump or shoulders, with the weight of the Lions often bringing the prey to the ground. Sometimes the prey’s neck is broken in falling. As soon as the prey is down it is seized by the throat or muzzle to effect strangulation. The Lions feed at the site of the kill or drag it to the nearest cover. The belly is ripped open and the stomach and intestines pulled out. Lions, especially males, frequently scavenge, acquiring up to 53% of food items in the open plains of the Serengeti this way. This figure decreases to 5% in more arid environments, where prey occurs at lower density. However, in the woodlands of Kruger National Park, male Lions acquire most of their food by hunting rather than scavenging. In Kruger the main prey of male Lions was African Buffalo; females fed on the most abundant medium-sized ungulates, such as Blue Wildebeest and Burchell’s Zebra. Lions will watch vultures descending on kills of other predators. Protection of kills against Spotted Hyenas,is greatly enhanced by the presence of a male. Females may lose up to 20% of their kills to Spotted Hyenas and a further 17% to unrelated Lions.

Some individuals nomadic, especially males and subadults. In the arid savanna of Etosha National Park Lions move a mean 13-2 km in 24 hours; in the S Kalahari an average 15-2 km (range 11-34 km). In contrast, Serengeti Lions averaged 4-5-6-5 km in 24 hours.

Adult males heavier (37-121 kg) than adult females (31-100 kg), and there is considerable regional variation in size. Jaguars from Central America are about half the size of cats from the Pantanal of Brazil and the Venezuelan Llanos. Background coat color varies from pale gold to a rich rusty red, and is patterned with a series of circular dark markings or rosettes that enclose one or more smaller black spots. In the similar-looking Leopard, there are no spots inside the black rosettes. A row of black spots along the middle of the Jaguar's back sometimes merges into a solid line. The underparts are whitish and marked with dark spots. The tail is marked with black spots and there are several black rings or bands on the terminal half. The ears are short and rounded, black on the back with a faint buff central spot. Melanistic individuals are common, and in bright light the spots on these black cats are often visible through the darker background of the fur. The Jaguaris a powerful, deep-chested, stocky cat with an unusually large, rounded head and short, sturdy limbs. The skull is heavy-boned, short, and broad, with a well-developed sagittal crest for muscle attachments, and the bite force on the robust caninesis greater than that of all other big cats.","Jaguars are found in a variety of forested habitats, including lowland tropical moist forest, gallery forests along rivers and streams, seasonally flooded wooded savannas, mangrove swamps, premontane moist forest, semi-deciduous forest, and humid montane and cloud forests to about 2000 m . Jaguars are often found in association with rivers, lakes and well-watered areas such as the swampy grasslands of the Brazilian Pantanal. They are excellent swimmers and have been seen crossing large rivers. Like Tigers, during the hot season Jaguars may spend the heat of the day half-submerged in a stream. They may occasionally be found in arid areas, buttypically only where watercourses penetrate this drier habitat. Jaguars avoid open forest and grassland habitat but are commonly found along the edges of forest openings.","Jaguars are opportunistic predators, capable of killing almost any prey they encounter. The cat's powerful jaws and robust canine teeth enable it to kill livestock weighing three to four times its own weight, often with a bite to the back of the skull, rather than the more common neck or throat bite employed by other large cats. The canines are also strong enough to penetrate the hard shells of large river turtles and the thick hides of crocodilians. More than 85 prey species are listed in the cat’s diet. In the seasonally flooded savannas of Venezuela ,Jaguars preferred Capybara ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and Collared Peccary (Pecari tajacu), but they also preyed on White-tailed Deer ( Odocoileus virginianus), caiman, freshwater turtles and turtle eggs ( Chelidae , Pelomedusidae ), tortoises, iguanas, and cattle. Collared Peccary, agouti, and large turtles also formed the bulk of the Jaguar's diet in the lowland tropical forest of Manu National Park, Peru . Jaguars in Iguacu National Park, Brazil , fed mainly on Collared Peccary, White-lipped Peccary (Tayassu peccari), Brocket ( Mazama ) and White-tailed Deer; minor prey included coati, agouti, marsupials, armadillos, rabbits, Paca (Cuniculus paca), squirrels, birds, reptiles and primates. In the Cockscomb Basis of Belize armadillos were the single most important prey, occurring in half of all Jaguar feces. Three-toed sloths (Bradypus) and iguanas were the prominent prey items in the Jaguar's diet in La Selva, Costa Rica . In the Paraguayan Chaco, small and medium-size mammals, principally Brocket Deer, rabbits, armadillos, and marsupials were important prey. Although Jaguars are especially fond of peccaries, the cat’s basic diet tends to reflect the relative abundance of the various prey species in an area. In areas where native ungulates have been depleted and forest habitats converted to pastures for domestic stock, Jaguars subsist to a large extent on cattle. The Jaguar can climb treesifit has to, but it is essentially a terrestrial hunter. Like many other felids, Jaguars hunt by walking slowly along gametrails and roads, listening and looking for prey. They will wait in ambush at waterholes or wallows for peccaries or patrol river banks in search of basking crocodilians or turtles. Having spotted an animal they will stalk it, using every bit of cover to get as close as possible, before launching an attack. After one or two bounds the prey is seized with the claws and killed with a bite. Jaguars have been seen jumping into the water after Capybara and managing to catch them before they can dive to safety. Prey may be eaten on the spot or carried for several hundred meters or more to a site where the cat presumably feels comfortable. Activity patterns. Radio-telemetry studies show that Jaguars have variable activity patterns. In Mexico, Belize , and Venezuela the cat is primarily nocturnal, spending the daytime resting in tangled thickets, caves, or in dense cover before becoming active around sunset. In Peru and Brazil Jaguars were just as active during the daytime as they were at night. Variation in activity patterns is common and probably reflects differences in the daily and seasonal activity patterns of the prey, changes in prey availability, and possibly human disturbance. Cattle are often taken during the daytime, as are crocodilians and turtles; deer and peccary are more likely to be active at night or around sunrise and sunset. Cats that are frequently harassed by people during the daytime typically become nocturnal. Movements, Home range and Social organization. There are few precise estimates of distances traveled by Jaguars during their nightly movements, but based on following tracks, experienced hunters guessed that females moved 3—4 km per night and males about 10 km . In W Mexico , radio-collared Jaguars travelled up to 20 km in a night of hunting. Home range sizes show considerable variation between sites and by season. At one ranch in the southern Pantanal, the dry season home ranges of four females varied from 97 to 168 km ® and overlapped extensively. To what extent this overlap was influenced by relatedness is unknown, but two of the females were mother and daughter. An adult male’s range in the same area was 152 km ? During the wet season their ranges were four to five times smaller than in the dry season, because large areas were inundated to depths of eight to nine feet, and prey were concentrated on the high ground. Ata ranch in the western Pantanal, where wet season flooding was not as severe, the home ranges of a presumed mother and daughter overlapped completely and measured 38 km *. Their ranges overlapped slightly with another female’s whose range was 25 km ? An adult male’s range overlapped the ranges of all these females. The average home range size of three adult male Jaguars in Iguacu National Park, Brazil , was 110 km ” (range 86-139 km®); an adult female’s range was 70 km ? In the dry tropical forest of W Mexico , female Jaguar ranges are about 25 km ? in the dry season and 65 km ” in the wet season. In this habitat, prey that was concentrated around water sources during the dry season disperses throughout the forest with the onset of the rains. Jaguar densities are remarkably similar across the cat’s range. At sites in Brazil , Peru , Colombia , Venezuela , and Mexico , densities range from 1-3-5 adults per 100 km ®. Jaguar density in Belize was estimated at 8-8 adults/ 100 km ? while the highest densities recorded (10-11 Jaguars/ 100 km ?) are in the Brazilian Pantanal, a vast natural floodplain.",,"Radio-telemetry studies show that Jaguars have variable activity patterns.

Both male and female Jaguars roar, and roaring may serve to bring the sexes together for mating. There are anecdotal reports that females in heat travel widely, calling for a mate. Estrus lasts 6-17 days and copulation is rapid and frequent: a pair may mate 100 times per day. The young are born after a gestation period of 93-105 days. Litter size varies from 1-4, with an average of two. Births occur throughout the year in tropical areas but in the more temperate portions of the Jaguar’s range there is some evidence suggesting a summer birth peak. Kittens weigh about 700-900 g at birth and have coarse, woolly, spotted coats. Their eyes open at 13 days of age. The young are totally dependent on their mother’s milk until they are 10-11 weeks old and may continue to suckle until they are 5-6 months old. Males grow faster than females and at two years of age young males may be 50% heavier than their female siblings. At 15-18 months young Jaguar are usually traveling independently within their mother’s range, making their own kills. Dispersal occurs at 16-24 months of age. Females attain sexual maturity at 24-30 months and males at 3—4 years.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. All countries within the range of the Jaguar are members of CITES, and all countries with Jaguar populations have laws that forbid killing them. However, these laws are not always well enforced and most allow a rancher to kill Jaguars to protect domestic stock. Jaguar numbers are declining across most of South and Central America. The greatest losses have occurred in the drier northern parts of the cat’s range in the USA , where there is some recent evidence of a resident population. Mexico , and at the southern end, in the scrub grasslands of Argentina . There are no reliable estimates of how much the Jaguar’s range has been diminished, but one calculation suggests that since European settlement the cat’s range has shrunk from 15 million km* to 8-7 million km®. Currently, the species’ stronghold is the six million km*® Amazon Basin rainforest, but even there efforts are underway to open the area to development. Today, the most important factor affecting Jaguar numbers is habitat loss from timber extraction and conversion to pasture and agricultural lands. Jaguar habitat is also being lost as forests are modified in association with mining operations, oil drilling, and human settlements. People associated with these settlements and operations often supplement their diet with wild game and thus compete directly with Jaguars for prey such as Capybara, peccary and deer. When Spanish and Portuguese settlers introduced cattle to the New World they provided theJaguar with large, easy-tokill prey. Today, in the savannas and gallery forest of Colombia , Venezuela , and Brazil , ranchers graze millions of cattle in habitats also used by Jaguar. Herd management is rudimentary and preand post-natal mortality of calves is high. Some losses are attributable to depredation byJaguar, but for most ranches the real impact is unknown. The impacts can also vary from site to site. On the Miranda Ranch in the southern Pantanal, cattle comprised 46% of Jaguar kills and 35% of Puma kills. One ranch in the Venezuelan Llanos reported that cattle depredation by felines accounted for 6% of all calf losses. At another ranch in the same area, depredation caused 30% of calf losses. For small cattle operations, the value of calf loss can be high. The result is that Jaguars are usually targeted whenever they are encountered. A few attempts have been made to modify cattle management practices, but with no analysis of effectiveness or cost-benefit. Some efforts have been made to control “problem or nuisance” animals by removal or translocation to other areas, but since relocated Jaguars are seldom followed the effectiveness of this practice remains unknown. The few studies that have been conducted show that not all Jaguars kill cattle. During a 2year study on a large cattle ranch in the Venezuelan Llanos, researchers found that only 13% of all calf mortality was due to large cats, and that Puma were responsible for 86% of the cat mortality. At a site in Belize , most confirmed cattle-killing Jaguar showed signs of previous shotgun wounds. In some areas ranchers may be partially responsible for livestock depredation problems when they shoot at and injure Jaguars, because such injuries may force these cats to subsist on the easier to catch livestock. Until recently it has been assumed that the Jaguar had some degree of natural protection because many of its populations were largely inaccessible to people. Over the last decade there has been a growing realization that this protection is rapidly disappearing. Recently, efforts have been made to build a framework for Jaguar conservation and research throughout its geographic range, much like the model for the Tiger. Priorities include information exchange, standardized research methods, assessment of threats, and cooperation across borders.","de Almeida (1976) | Aranda & Sanchez-Cordero (1996) | Azevedo (2008) | Bisbal (1989) | Crawshaw & Quigley (1991) | Eizirik et al.

There are no reliable estimates of how much the Jaguar’s range has been diminished, but one calculation suggests that since European settlement the cat’s range has shrunk from 15 million km* to 8-7 million km®. Currently, the species’ stronghold is the six million km*® Amazon Basin rainforest, but even there efforts are underway to open the area to development. Today, the most important factor affecting Jaguar numbers is habitat loss from timber extraction and conversion to pasture and agricultural lands. Jaguar habitat is also being lost as forests are modified in association with mining operations, oil drilling, and human settlements. People associated with these settlements and operations often supplement their diet with wild game and thus compete directly with Jaguars for prey such as Capybara, peccary and deer. When Spanish and Portuguese settlers introduced cattle to the New World they provided theJaguar with large, easy-tokill prey. Today, in the savannas and gallery forest of Colombia , Venezuela , and Brazil , ranchers graze millions of cattle in habitats also used by Jaguar. Herd management is rudimentary and preand post-natal mortality of calves is high. Some losses are attributable to depredation byJaguar, but for most ranches the real impact is unknown. The impacts can also vary from site to site. On the Miranda Ranch in the southern Pantanal, cattle comprised 46% of Jaguar kills and 35% of Puma kills. One ranch in the Venezuelan Llanos reported that cattle depredation by felines accounted for 6% of all calf losses. At another ranch in the same area, depredation caused 30% of calf losses. For small cattle operations, the value of calf loss can be high. The result is that Jaguars are usually targeted whenever they are encountered. A few attempts have been made to modify cattle management practices, but with no analysis of effectiveness or cost-benefit. Some efforts have been made to control “problem or nuisance” animals by removal or translocation to other areas, but since relocated Jaguars are seldom followed the effectiveness of this practice remains unknown. The few studies that have been conducted show that not all Jaguars kill cattle. During a 2year study on a large cattle ranch in the Venezuelan Llanos, researchers found that only 13% of all calf mortality was due to large cats, and that Puma were responsible for 86% of the cat mortality. At a site in Belize , most confirmed cattle-killing Jaguar showed signs of previous shotgun wounds. In some areas ranchers may be partially responsible for livestock depredation problems when they shoot at and injure Jaguars, because such injuries may force these cats to subsist on the easier to catch livestock. Until recently it has been assumed that the Jaguar had some degree of natural protection because many of its populations were largely inaccessible to people. Over the last decade there has been a growing realization that this protection is rapidly disappearing. Recently, efforts have been made to build a framework for Jaguar conservation and research throughout its geographic range, much like the model for the Tiger. Priorities include information exchange, standardized research methods, assessment of threats, and cooperation across borders.

Tall, lightly-built cats with a short tail. Background coat color is tawny, marked with fine, freckle-sized black dots or larger black spots along the back and sides. The spots may form bars on the neck, shoulders, and limbs. The spot pattern is similar to that of the Cheetah and the skins of the two species are sometimes confused. Melanistic individuals are common in the highlands of Kenya and Ethiopia . Forits size, has the longest legs of any member of the cat family.

The face is small and delicate and the skull is lightly built. Ears are extremely large and oval shaped; backs of ears are black and marked with a white spot or line. Auditory bullae are large and well-developed.","Found in almostall types of grasslands and savannas in Africa. Their distribution is closely tied to water and associated vegetation, reed beds and marshes. Sometimes found along watercourses that penetrate semi-desert and desert and in forest areas interspersed with grassy glades and edges. Also found in subalpine habitats and high moorlands to 3000 m , and in farmlands with high rodent densities. They are absent from the dense rain forests of Central Africa. Use medium and tall grasslands and reed bedsas rest sites, although in areas with greater disturbance from people and livestock frequently retreat to patches of woody vegetation during the day.","Specialized small mammal predators, well equipped to capture rodents in tall grass. Over 90% of the diet consists of prey weighing less than 200 g . Murid rodents dominate the diet. The multimammate mouse, Vlei rat, pygmy mouse, and various grass mice make up the bulk of the diet. Other murid prey include water rats, mole rats, gerbils, climbing mice, pouched mice, veld rats, groove-toothed rats, and black rats. Also eat shrews ( Soricidae ), golden moles ( Chrysochloridae ), cane rats ( Thryonomyidae ), and Scrub Hare (Lepus saxatilis). They occasionally take larger prey such as young Thomson's Gazelle and duikers, flamingos, black-bellied bustards (Lzssotis melanogaster), and rails. They also prey on smaller birds such as waxbills and quailfinches, larks, pipits, weavers, cisticolas, and swallows. Other prey includes grass and sand snakes ( Colubridae ), lizards ( Agamidae ), frogs, crabs, grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts. They have a specialized, almost foxlike, hunting style. Their long legs provide the large ears with a raised platform to “hear into” the tall grass. Long mobile toes and strong curved claws serve to hook prey from burrows or beneath vegetation. They locate their prey primarily by hearing and when hunting the cat walks slowly, stopping periodically to listen. It may stop and sit for 15 minutes at a time, scanning the area for sounds. When it hears something move it locates the exact position of the sound, then pounceslike a fox, leaping into the air and striking the prey with a blow from one or both feet. A single pounce may span 3-6 m and may be over one meter high.If the initial pounce is not successful it may be followed with a series ofstiff-legged bouncing jumps. Have been seen leaping 2-3 m into the air to seize birds and insects in flight. They also probe holes and crevices for nestling birds and rodents and can hook live fish out of water. Strong winds disruptits ability to hear and pinpoint the location of prey and hunting is often curtailed on windy days. Activity patterns. In Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania , were largely crepuscular. Typically rested during midday and occasionally at night. One female increased her daytime activity significantly when she had kittens, spending more time traveling in search of food. In the Kamberg Biosphere Reserve, Natal, were predominantly nocturnal, possibly because of human disturbance. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In the Ngorongoro Crater an adult male and an female traveled an estimated at 2-4 km per night. Home range sizes of an adult male and an adult female in the Crater were at least 11-6 and 9-5 km? respectively. The full extent of their ranges could not be ascertained because they were not radio-tagged and there were times when they disappeared for several months from their normal haunts. However, one adult female was repeatedly sighted in the same area over a nine-year period, indicating strong site fidelity. Two radio-collaredfemales in the farmland that is part of the Kamberg Biosphere Reserve, Natal, had home ranges of 19-8 and 15-8 km? a tagged male’s range was 31-5 km? The adult male’s range in the Crater overlapped the smaller ranges of at least two adult females, but the home ranges of three adult females showed little overlap. In Kamberg, the adult male’s range overlapped extensively with that of an adult female. Two adult females utilized common areas, but they did so at different times. Adults of both sexes regularly scent mark as they move about their home ranges, although males mark at a much higher frequency. Urine spraying on trees, bushes, and other conspicuous objects is the most frequent type of marking, but also make scrape marks on the ground with their foreand hindfeet and leave their feces in prominent locations. They are solitary animals: sighting of groups or pairs consist of a mother with her young or a mating pair.

Females are polyestrous and in general births seem to occur about a month before the peak in murid rodent reproduction. Estruslasts from 1-4 days, and after a gestation period of about 74 days femalestypically give birth to two kittens (range 1-4 young). Young weigh about 250 g at birth. Birth dens are usually in dense vegetation or disused Aardvark or porcupine burrows. The mother begins to bring food back to the den when young are about a month old.

L. s. tanae Pocock, 1944 — dry zone of Ethiopia , Eritrea , and N Somalia . Descriptive notes. Head-body 59-92 cm, tail 20-38 cm; weight 7-13. 5 kg , with adult malesslightly larger than adult females. Tall, lightly-built cats with a short tail. Background coat color is tawny, marked with fine, freckle-sized black dots or larger black spots along the back and sides. The spots may form bars on the neck, shoulders, and limbs. The spot pattern is similar to that of the Cheetah and the skins of the two species are sometimes confused. Melanistic individuals are common in the highlands of Kenya and Ethiopia . Forits size, has the longest legs of any member of the cat family. Elongated metatarsal bones add considerably to the cat’s height. An adult stands 60 cm at the shoulder— more than 20 cm taller than the similarsized Ocelot. The face is small and delicate and the skull is lightly built. Ears are extremely large and oval shaped; backs of ears are black and marked with a white spot or line. Auditory bullae are large and well-developed. Habitat. Found in almostall types of grasslands and savannas in Africa. Their distribution is closely tied to water and associated vegetation, reed beds and marshes. Sometimes found along watercourses that penetrate semi-desert and desert and in forest areas interspersed with grassy glades and edges. Also found in subalpine habitats and high moorlands to 3000 m , and in farmlands with high rodent densities. They are absent from the dense rain forests of Central Africa. Use medium and tall grasslands and reed bedsas rest sites, although in areas with greater disturbance from people and livestock frequently retreat to patches of woody vegetation during the day. Food and Feeding. Specialized small mammal predators, well equipped to capture rodents in tall grass. Over 90% of the diet consists of prey weighing less than 200 g . Murid rodents dominate the diet. The multimammate mouse, Vlei rat, pygmy mouse, and various grass mice make up the bulk of the diet. Other murid prey include water rats, mole rats, gerbils, climbing mice, pouched mice, veld rats, groove-toothed rats, and black rats. Also eat shrews ( Soricidae ), golden moles ( Chrysochloridae ), cane rats ( Thryonomyidae ), and Scrub Hare (Lepus saxatilis). They occasionally take larger prey such as young Thomson's Gazelle and duikers, flamingos, black-bellied bustards (Lzssotis melanogaster), and rails. They also prey on smaller birds such as waxbills and quailfinches, larks, pipits, weavers, cisticolas, and swallows. Other prey includes grass and sand snakes ( Colubridae ), lizards ( Agamidae ), frogs, crabs, grasshoppers, crickets, and locusts. They have a specialized, almost foxlike, hunting style. Their long legs provide the large ears with a raised platform to “hear into” the tall grass. Long mobile toes and strong curved claws serve to hook prey from burrows or beneath vegetation. They locate their prey primarily by hearing and when hunting the cat walks slowly, stopping periodically to listen. It may stop and sit for 15 minutes at a time, scanning the area for sounds. When it hears something move it locates the exact position of the sound, then pounceslike a fox, leaping into the air and striking the prey with a blow from one or both feet. A single pounce may span 3-6 m and may be over one meter high.If the initial pounce is not successful it may be followed with a series ofstiff-legged bouncing jumps. Have been seen leaping 2-3 m into the air to seize birds and insects in flight. They also probe holes and crevices for nestling birds and rodents and can hook live fish out of water. Strong winds disruptits ability to hear and pinpoint the location of prey and hunting is often curtailed on windy days. Activity patterns. In Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania , were largely crepuscular. Typically rested during midday and occasionally at night. One female increased her daytime activity significantly when she had kittens, spending more time traveling in search of food. In the Kamberg Biosphere Reserve, Natal, were predominantly nocturnal, possibly because of human disturbance. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In the Ngorongoro Crater an adult male and an female traveled an estimated at 2-4 km per night. Home range sizes of an adult male and an adult female in the Crater were at least 11-6 and 9-5 km? respectively. The full extent of their ranges could not be ascertained because they were not radio-tagged and there were times when they disappeared for several months from their normal haunts. However, one adult female was repeatedly sighted in the same area over a nine-year period, indicating strong site fidelity. Two radio-collaredfemales in the farmland that is part of the Kamberg Biosphere Reserve, Natal, had home ranges of 19-8 and 15-8 km? a tagged male’s range was 31-5 km? The adult male’s range in the Crater overlapped the smaller ranges of at least two adult females, but the home ranges of three adult females showed little overlap. In Kamberg, the adult male’s range overlapped extensively with that of an adult female. Two adult females utilized common areas, but they did so at different times. Adults of both sexes regularly scent mark as they move about their home ranges, although males mark at a much higher frequency. Urine spraying on trees, bushes, and other conspicuous objects is the most frequent type of marking, but also make scrape marks on the ground with their foreand hindfeet and leave their feces in prominent locations. They are solitary animals: sighting of groups or pairs consist of a mother with her young or a mating pair. Density estimates vary from eight per 100 km ? in Natal’s Kamberg Biosphere Reserve to 41 per 100 km ? in Ngorongoro Crater. Breeding. Females are polyestrous and in general births seem to occur about a month before the peak in murid rodent reproduction. Estruslasts from 1-4 days, and after a gestation period of about 74 days femalestypically give birth to two kittens (range 1-4 young). Young weigh about 250 g at birth. Birth dens are usually in dense vegetation or disused Aardvark or porcupine burrows. The mother begins to bring food back to the den when young are about a month old. Young acquire their permanent canine teeth at aboutsix months of age and begin to hunt for themselves shortly thereafter. Newly independent young are sometimes allowed to remain within their natal range for a year or more. In captivity, there are records of females becoming sexually mature when they were just over a year old, and a male wasfirst seen mating at 17 months of age. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Listed as species of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Not protected by national legislation over most ofits geographic range.

They do notlive in true desert or dense tropical rainforest. They are often associated with edge habitats where forest and grassland meet, and though they use open grasslands at night, they require access to bushes and rocks for daytime restsites.","Caracal generally take prey that weigh less than 5 kg , including hares, hyrax, small rodents, and birds. They will, however, take larger (over 15 kg ) prey if the opportunity arises. In two studies in South Africa’s Mountain Zebra National Park, hyrax were found in 53 and 60% ofscats, and Mountain Reedbuck were found in eleven and 20% of scats, respectively. Due to their greatersize, reedbuck contributed 62 and 72% of meat consumed. Caracal also killed a variety of other bovids in and outside the park, including Springbok, duiker, and Steenbok. Bovids, including Reedbuck, Common Duiker (Silvicapra grimmia) and Blue Duiker (Philatomba monticola), Steenbok, Bushbuck, Common Rhebok ( Pelea capreolus), and Klipspringers ( Oreotragus oreotragus) were the most frequently occurring (43-6%) prey items in the stomach contents of Caracal from the Eastern Cape Province , South Africa . Hyrax and Scrub Hare combined ranked second at almost 20%. In Botswana , Caracal fed mainly on small mammals but they also ate hares, spring hares, quail, partridge, and lizards. Mammals were also the dominant prey of caracal in Israel , and hares were the principal prey. Birds, mainly partridges, made up 24% of the cat’s diet in this area. Incidental prey included mole rats, hedgehogs, the Egyptian Mongoose, and reptiles and insects. In Turkmenistan , small prey such as hare, sand rats, jerboas, and ground squirrels dominate the Caracal’s diet. Caracal stalk as close as possible to their prey before making a final sprint; they also use their powerful hindlegs to make prodigious leapsinto the air to capture birds. Hare-sized prey is killed with a bite to the nape. Larger prey is usually killed by suffocation with a throat bite. Activity patterns. The Caracal is predominantly nocturnal. One study in Israel found the cats were most active from dusk to dawn, although they sometimes extended their activity into the early morning. Differences in the duration of daytime activity were largely dependent on daytime temperatures and the activity patterns of their prey, which are also affected by ambient temperatures. Caracals in the Sahara are crepuscular and nocturnal, but only in the hot season. At cooler times of the year or on overcast days during the rainy season the cat may be active until mid-morning or become active by midto late afternoon. In more hilly terrain, where there is abundant escape cover, Caracals have a tendency to become bold and move around in the daytime. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In Israel , radio-collared males traveled an average of 10-4 km per day; females traveled an average of 6-6 km. Home ranges of five adult males in Israel were large, averaging 220 km ? compared to an average of 57 km ? for four adult females. Female home ranges were greatly reduced when they had small young but gradually expanded as the young became mobile. Each male’s range overlapped the smaller ranges of one or more females and there was considerable overlap (50%) between adjacent male ranges. Female ranges showed much less overlap (25%). In the western sector of Cape Province , South Africa , the home range size of four adult females averaged 18-2 km?* while an adult male’s home range measured 65 km ®. In Mountain Zebra National Park the home ranges of males and females residing inside the park averaged 15-2 and 5-5 km? respectively.

This diversity of habitats might suggest that they are habitat generalists, but close monitoring of radio-collared animals indicates they are highly dependent on dense ground or forest cover. Indeed, they occupy a much narrower range of microhabitats than would have been predicted by their wide geographic distribution. Ocelots often rest during the daytime in brush piles, clumps of vines in trees, among the roots of large trees, under tree falls, and even in concrete culverts.","Primarily on terrestrial, nocturnal rodents weighing less than 1 kg . The small rodents include rice rats, cotton rats, marsh rats, Black Rats, cane mice, pocket mice, and spiny rats. They also prey on opossums, squirrels, cavies, rabbits, and small primates (Callictrichidae, Cebidae ). Larger prey are taken relatively infrequently and include tamanduas, armadillos, sloths, pacas, agoutis and acouchis, porcupines, young Collared Peccaries, and young White-tailed Deer and brocket deer. In some areas young iguanas and land crabs ( Trichodactylidae ) are important seasonal components of the diet. There are also records of ocelots taking guans, doves, tinamous, frogs, fish, and insects. The occurrence of aquatic and semi-aquatic prey in the diet is not unexpected, as Ocelots are reportedly strong swimmers and in some areas they live in seasonally inundated environments. Ocelots usually hunt at night, scanning for prey while walking slowly along trails. They are also sit-and-wait predators. On occasion they spend 30-60 minutes sitting motionless at a site, then move rapidly to another hunting site where they sit and wait again. Though they hunt mostly in dense cover they sometimes forage in open areas at night. Activity patterns. Commonly active twelve tol14 hours a day. They typically rest between dawn and late afternoon, then begin moving an hour or so before sunset. Diurnal activity is not uncommon. In Venezuela , activity levels of radio-collared Ocelots increased sharply around sunset and remained fairly high throughout the night. Activity levels decreased substantially after sunrise and the cats usually rested from mid-morning until mid-afternoon. Ocelots were significantly more active during the daytime in the wet season, particularly on cloudy and overcast days. Daytime activity is probably related to the diurnal activity of some prey species such as birds, iguanas, and small primates. Activity levels may also change in response to other circumstances. In Peru , one female increased her hunting efforts to 17 hours a day to try to feed her single young. For reasons unknown, a male in the same area walked for 31 out of 34 consecutive hours. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Ocelots spend the majority of their active periods walking slowly (0-3 to 1-4 km/h) about their home ranges. Distances traveled by males during these nightly activities tend to be greater than those of females. Detailed radio-tracking studies in Venezuela showed that in the dry season, adult males traveled about 7-6 km per night compared to 3-8 km per night for adult females. Their movements were sometimes nearly continuous and at other times their travels were punctuated by short periods (30-60 minutes) of no detectable movement, when the cats were probably sitting and waiting for prey to pass by. Distances traveled by both sexes in the wet season were reduced by 18 to 24%. Information on home range sizes of adult females indicates remarkably small variation across the species’ geographic distribution, varying only from 0-8 to 15-6 km*. For adult males, home range size varies from 3-5 to 17-7 km?®. Ocelots are solitary, and the larger ranges of adult males typically overlap the smaller home ranges of two to three adult females. Density estimates of Ocelots vary from 13-7/ 100 km ? in southern Brazil to 40/ 100 km ? in the Venezuelan llanos and 80/ 100 km ® in the lowland rain forest of the Peruvian Amazon.

Young weigh about 250 g at birth and grow and mature slowly; they begin following their mother at about three months of age and remain dependent on her for food for several more months. Young do not attain adult weight until they are 24-30 months of age. In the wild the interbirth interval is every two years. Young disperse from their natal ranges when they are 2-3 years old. Dispersal distances for 13 radio-tagged young varied from 2-5 to 30 km . The lifetime reproductive potential for an eight-year old female is about 4-6 young. In captivity, Ocelots are known to live for 20 years, but longevity in the wild is likely to be half that.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. In the 1960s, as populations of large spotted cats began to dwindle, the fur trade shifted to the smaller spotted cats, particularly the Ocelot. From the early 1960s to the mid-1970s an estimated 200,000 ocelot were killed annually for the skin trade. A variety of wildlife protection laws were enacted during the same time interval and many countries outlawed the commercial export of wildlife. Other consumer countries began to prohibit the import of spotted cat skins and the number of ocelot skins in trade dropped significantly. The species was upgraded to Appendix I in 1989 and international trade ceased, but illegal hunting continues in some areas. Compared with the similar-sized Bobcat, present species has a low reproductive potential, and thus would appear to be vulnerable to even low levels of exploitation.","Aliag-Rossel et al.

Birds such as tinamous and guans are also taken, as are amphibians, reptiles, insects and fruit. Most prey is nocturnal and arboreal, but also hunts on the ground. Agile climbers and leapers and can climb down a tree trunk head first and hang by their hindfeet from a branch. Several anatomical adaptations allow them to perform these acrobatics: they can pronate and supinate the hindfeet, allowing them to grip a branch equally well with their hindor forefeet; and their broad, soft feet provide a good platform for jumping and an effective gripping surface for climbing. Limited information from the wild supports the notion that they do much of their hunting above the ground. Activity patterns.

The estrous cycle is 32-36 days and estrus lasts 4-10 days; the gestation period is about 76-84 days, which is longer than that recorded for other small cats. Litter size is commonly one, and at birth the young weigh about 85-125 g, although two young weighed 163 and 170 g at birth.

L. w. yucatanicus Nelson & Goldman, 1931 — rainforest regions of Mexico . Descriptive notes. Head-body 42.5-79. 2 cm , tail 30-51. 8 cm ; weight 2:3—4-9 kg. Adult males and females are about the same size. A small, lightly built cat with a long tail. Resembles a small Ocelot. Fur is thick and soft and background color varies from grayish to cinnamon. Coat is marked with dark brown or black open and solid spots and longitudinal streaks. The belly is white. Tail is long and bushy, about 70% of head-body length, and marked with about twelve dark rings and a black tip. Compared with the Ocelot, present species has shorter, more rounded head, with strikingly large, almost bulging, eyes. Backs of the ears are black with a central white spot. Paws are relatively large and flexible, with mobile digits. Habitat. Forest dwellers, more strongly associated with forest habitats than any other neotropical cat. In Mexico, found in coastal lowland, tropical deciduous, and evergreen gallery forests; in Belize , radio-collared cats preferred late second-growth forests to mature forests. In Venezuela , it is reported from humid lowland tropical forests, premontane moist forests, cloud forest, and shaded coffee or cocoa plantations. There are also reports in Bolivia using xerophytic thickets and the Bolivian Chaco. In the Linhares Forest Reserve, Brazil , seen in human-modified areas containing stands of bamboo and palm plantations. Rarely found at elevations above 1200 m . On following pages: 16. Colocolo ( Leopardus colocolo ); 17. Andean Mountain Cat ( Leopardus jacobitus ); 18. Oncilla ( Leopardus tigrinus ); 19. Kodkod ( Leopardus guigna ); 20. Geoffroy's Cat ( Leopardus geoffroyi ). Food and Feeding. Diet consists mainly of arboreal mammals, including opossums, squirrels, and climbing rats ( Muridae ); they also prey on terrestrial mammals such as spiny pocket mice, cane mice, cavy, rabbits, agouti, and paca. Birds such as tinamous and guans are also taken, as are amphibians, reptiles, insects and fruit. Most prey is nocturnal and arboreal, but also hunts on the ground. Agile climbers and leapers and can climb down a tree trunk head first and hang by their hindfeet from a branch. Several anatomical adaptations allow them to perform these acrobatics: they can pronate and supinate the hindfeet, allowing them to grip a branch equally well with their hindor forefeet; and their broad, soft feet provide a good platform for jumping and an effective gripping surface for climbing. Limited information from the wild supports the notion that they do much of their hunting above the ground. Activity patterns. In captivity, two peaks of activity: one between 01:00-02:00 h and another between 04:00-05:00 h. A young male radio-tracked in Belize was strictly nocturnal, but a radio-collared male in S Brazil was active at anytime of the daytime or night. Daytime restsites are usually in trees, and cats have been located in tangles of vines or in the bole of palm trees. Movements, Home range and Social organization. They are solitary animals and appear to live at much lower densities than the Ocelot. A young adult male in Belize traveled about six km per day and over the six months he was tracked, used an area of 11 km ? The home range of an adult male in S Brazil measured 15-9 km®. Breeding. Most of what is known of reproduction is derived from a small number of captive animals. The estrous cycle is 32-36 days and estrus lasts 4-10 days; the gestation period is about 76-84 days, which is longer than that recorded for other small cats. Litter size is commonly one, and at birth the young weigh about 85-125 g, although two young weighed 163 and 170 g at birth. Young begin to eat solid food at 7-8 weeks of age and by 8-10 months they are nearly adult size. Estrus has been reported in 6~10month old females, but sexual maturity is more commonly attained at about two years of age. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Despite their small size, heavily hunted for their skins in the past. In 1977, ranked first among the Neotropical cats in terms of number of skins in trade. In 1989, when the species was moved to CITES Appendix I, international trade ceased, butillegal hunting continues in some areas.

Adult males average 8.9-13. 3 kg . Adult females average 5.8-9. 2 kg . Cranial measurements and adult weights indicate a size gradient that decreases with latitude. Kittens weigh 0.3-0. 4 kg at birth. The pelage contains various shades of buff-brown, and is mottled with dark spots and streaks. Some may have a rufous tint to the pelage. Cranial furis streaked with black, and the back of the earsis heavily marked with black. Forest subspecies are darker in color compared to subspecies inhabiting more open habitats. Melanism has been documented ten times in Florida and once in New Brunswick , both peripheral and peninsular portions of the species’ range. Adults have 28 teeth. Where range overlap occurs, can be confused with Canadian Lynx , another medium-sized, short-tailed felid. In comparison to it however, present species is generally smaller, and has shorter, more slender legs, smaller feet, ear tufts that are smaller than 3 cm or completely missing, and a longertail. Additionally, the ventral tail tip is white, whereas the tail tip is completely black in Canadian Lynx . Usually silent, but they can make loud vocalizations that may be associated with mating behavior.","Throughout its range, uses a wide variety of natural habitats. These range from coniferous and deciduous forest in Maine to brushlands in Oklahoma, bottomland hardwoods in Louisiana, semi-deserts in Arizona and New Mexico , humid tropical forests in Florida, dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak in Mexico , mountainous terrain in Oregon, mixed mesophytic forests of the Cumberland Plateau, and prairies in eastern Montana. They can also inhabit human-altered landscapes such as agricultural lands,if sufficient cover exists nearby. Generally prefer rugged, rocky landscapes with dense cover. Prey density is the most important factor influencing habitat selection. However, other factors affecting habitat selection include protection from severe weather, availability of den sites, adequate cover for hunting and escape, and low human disturbance. Females will establish natal dens in small caves, rock crevices, thickets, hollow trees, brush piles, stumps, and root-masses from fallen trees.","Like most felids, use dense cover to stalk prey or to conceal themselves to ambush their prey. Although they feed on a diverse array of species, lagomorphs are commonly utilized throughout the species’ range. Cottontails and Snowshoe Hares are the two lagomorphs most commonly eaten. Generally select small to medium-sized prey (0.7-5. 5 kg ), but they will kill prey as large as White-tailed Deer, especially in northern climates during winter. Usually kill deer by stalking a resting animal, pouncing on the back and head, and repeatedly biting the victim’s throat. However, most use of White-tailed Deer results from the opportunistic discovery of carrion. Ultimately, the kind of prey utilized is dependent upon geographic location. In Florida, Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), Marsh Rabbit (S. palustris), and Hispid Cotton Rat ( Sigmodon hispidus) account for 66-78% ofthe diet. Florida subspecies prey on birds more frequently and ungulates less frequently than do more northern populations. Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus), Mule Deer ( Odocoileus hemionus), and Mountain Beaver (Aplodontia rufa) are primary prey in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. In New England and New York , cottontail, Snowshoe Hare, and White-tailed Deer are the most important prey species. Snowshoe Hare, White-tailed Deer, and North American Porcupine ( Erethizon dorsata) compose over 90% of the winter diet in northern Minnesota. In eastern Nevada and Utah, 69% of the diet is cottontail and Black-tailedJackrabbit. Cottontail, squirrels, cotton rat, Eastern Woodrat ( Neotoma floridana), and mice ( Peromyscus spp.) are important components of diets in Arkansas. Females appear to prefer smaller prey than do males. Where ranges overlap, interference competition between Coyote, Red Fox, Puma , and present species may occur. Likely suffer most severely from this competition, because they show the greatest dependence on a single food source, lagomorphs. In Idaho, Pumas killed them during the winter while defending or stealing food. Activity patterns. Crepuscular and nocturnal activity mostly coincides with peak activity of lagomorphs, their dominant prey. In general, the daily activity pattern is bimodal, with the first period of activity from one hour before sunrise to three hours after sunrise, and the second from three hours before sunset to midnight. In Florida , are most active between 18:00-24:00 h and least active between 12:00-15:00 h. Several studies have reported increases in daylight activity during winter. Adult females with kittens exhibit reduced activity during the first month following birth. However, after kittens are weaned, adult females increase diurnal activity. Usually inactive during periods of extreme heat or severe weather. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary except during the breeding season. A variety of methods are utilized by this species to mark its territory including urine and feces deposition, soil scraping, tree scratching, and scent marking via anal gland secretions. Home range sizes vary with geographic location, sex, prey availability, and in some regions, season. Home ranges at higher latitudes are larger than those from more southern regions. Mean annual home range size for adult males varies from 2: 6 km ? in Alabama to 163 km ? in Idaho . Adult male home ranges often overlap with those of other males and females. Several studies reported that adult male home ranges expand during winter. This is apparently a response to maximizing breeding opportunities and seasonal shifts in prey availability. Adult female home ranges are usually 2-3 times smaller than those of adult males, and range from 1-2 km* in Alabama to 69-7 km® in Idaho . Overlap between adult female home ranges rarely occurs. However, a high level of intra-sex home range overlap was observed in Illinois . Adult females constrict home ranges during the summer due to parturition and kitten rearing. Annual home range sizes can fluctuate over time in response to changing prey densities. For example, adult male and female annual home ranges in south-east Idaho increased from 20-4 km? to 123 km ? and 11-6 km? to 69-7 km? respectively, over a three-year period. These increases were attributed to declining Black-tailed Jackrabbit and Cottontail populations. Nightly movements range between two and 20 km . Young disperse when they are approximately one year old. Dispersal involves a series of nomadic movements punctuated with temporary occupancy of activity areas that can last 60 days. Dispersal distances range from less than 1 km to nearly 200 km . In Florida , two females dispersed at least 12 km and 30 km respectively.",,"Crepuscular and nocturnal activity mostly coincides with peak activity of lagomorphs, their dominant prey.

Several studies reported that adult male home ranges expand during winter. This is apparently a response to maximizing breeding opportunities and seasonal shifts in prey availability. Adult female home ranges are usually 2-3 times smaller than those of adult males, and range from 1-2 km* in Alabama to 69-7 km® in Idaho . Overlap between adult female home ranges rarely occurs. However, a high level of intra-sex home range overlap was observed in Illinois . Adult females constrict home ranges during the summer due to parturition and kitten rearing. Annual home range sizes can fluctuate over time in response to changing prey densities. For example, adult male and female annual home ranges in south-east Idaho increased from 20-4 km? to 123 km ? and 11-6 km? to 69-7 km? respectively, over a three-year period. These increases were attributed to declining Black-tailed Jackrabbit and Cottontail populations. Nightly movements range between two and 20 km . Young disperse when they are approximately one year old. Dispersal involves a series of nomadic movements punctuated with temporary occupancy of activity areas that can last 60 days. Dispersal distances range from less than 1 km to nearly 200 km . In Florida , two females dispersed at least 12 km and 30 km respectively. Breeding. Breeding can occur year-round, but most occurs from February through May. Most females do not breed until two years of age, but breeding by yearlings has been documented. The estrous cycle is approximately 44 days, and females are usually in heat 5-10 days. Males do not breed until they are two years of age. A male may copulate with a single female multiple times over several days. Gestation takes approximately 62 days. One litter is produced per year, but there is evidence that a second litter may be produced by females that lose their first litter soon after parturition. Litters average three, but range from one to six kittens. Offspring open their eyes 9-10 days after birth, are weaned after two months, and begin traveling with their mother at about 3-5 months of age.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Historically, population trends have been driven by economic factors such as value of pelts, poultry depredation, and competition with humans for wildlife resources. Bounties were offered in the early 1700s as a means of controlling bobcat depredation on livestock and poultry. Prior to the 1970s,little concern was given to the conservation of predatory furbearers, including this species. Then public concern over the exploitation of wildlife led to the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which made it illegal to trade any species listed in Appendix I. This species was not placed in Appendix I of CITES, however, which allowed for the continued trade ofits pelts. Demand for pelts increased dramatically throughout the 1970s as the trade in other spotted cats declined. Annual harvests in the United States averaged 10,000 in the early 1970s (pre-CITES) at US $ 10 per pelt. By the end of the 1979-80 trapping season, more then 86,000 bobcats had been harvested at up to US $ 150 per pelt. In 1975, concern over decreasing populationsled to its placement in Appendix II of CITES, which allowed the export of pelts only if harvest was shown not to be detrimental to the population. Currently, remains on Appendix II and it is the only spotted felid in the world that can be trapped legally. Today, inhabits 47 of the 48 contiguous states (absent only from Delaware ). Of the 47 states in which it occurs, 37 allowed the species to be harvested through 1996. Indiana , Ohio , NewJersey, and Iowa listit as “Endangered,” and Illinois classifies the species as “Threatened.” A recent study in Illinois concluded that it was widely distributed and no longer warranted classification as “Threatened” in the state. Populations in Mexico and Canada are also faring well. However,still persecuted by Mexican ranchers due to its alleged depredation of sheep. Because of conservation laws and its tolerance of moderate amounts of habitat change, the species appears to be secure throughout much of its range. In fact, the species is recolonizing many parts ofits historic range from which it had been extirpated. On following pages: 22. Canadian Lynx ( Lynx canadensis ); 23. Eurasian Lynx ( Lynx lynx ); 24.

Adult males average 8.9-13. 3 kg . Adult females average 5.8-9. 2 kg . Cranial measurements and adult weights indicate a size gradient that decreases with latitude. Kittens weigh 0.3-0. 4 kg at birth. The pelage contains various shades of buff-brown, and is mottled with dark spots and streaks. Some may have a rufous tint to the pelage. Cranial furis streaked with black, and the back of the earsis heavily marked with black. Forest subspecies are darker in color compared to subspecies inhabiting more open habitats. Melanism has been documented ten times in Florida and once in New Brunswick , both peripheral and peninsular portions of the species’ range. Adults have 28 teeth. Where range overlap occurs, can be confused with Canadian Lynx , another medium-sized, short-tailed felid. In comparison to it however, present species is generally smaller, and has shorter, more slender legs, smaller feet, ear tufts that are smaller than 3 cm or completely missing, and a longertail. Additionally, the ventral tail tip is white, whereas the tail tip is completely black in Canadian Lynx . Usually silent, but they can make loud vocalizations that may be associated with mating behavior. Habitat. Throughout its range, uses a wide variety of natural habitats. These range from coniferous and deciduous forest in Maine to brushlands in Oklahoma, bottomland hardwoods in Louisiana, semi-deserts in Arizona and New Mexico , humid tropical forests in Florida, dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak in Mexico , mountainous terrain in Oregon, mixed mesophytic forests of the Cumberland Plateau, and prairies in eastern Montana. They can also inhabit human-altered landscapes such as agricultural lands,if sufficient cover exists nearby. Generally prefer rugged, rocky landscapes with dense cover. Prey density is the most important factor influencing habitat selection. However, other factors affecting habitat selection include protection from severe weather, availability of den sites, adequate cover for hunting and escape, and low human disturbance. Females will establish natal dens in small caves, rock crevices, thickets, hollow trees, brush piles, stumps, and root-masses from fallen trees. Food and Feeding. Like most felids, use dense cover to stalk prey or to conceal themselves to ambush their prey. Although they feed on a diverse array of species, lagomorphs are commonly utilized throughout the species’ range. Cottontails and Snowshoe Hares are the two lagomorphs most commonly eaten. Generally select small to medium-sized prey (0.7-5. 5 kg ), but they will kill prey as large as White-tailed Deer, especially in northern climates during winter. Usually kill deer by stalking a resting animal, pouncing on the back and head, and repeatedly biting the victim’s throat. However, most use of White-tailed Deer results from the opportunistic discovery of carrion. Ultimately, the kind of prey utilized is dependent upon geographic location. In Florida, Eastern Cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), Marsh Rabbit (S. palustris), and Hispid Cotton Rat ( Sigmodon hispidus) account for 66-78% ofthe diet. Florida subspecies prey on birds more frequently and ungulates less frequently than do more northern populations. Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus), Mule Deer ( Odocoileus hemionus), and Mountain Beaver (Aplodontia rufa) are primary prey in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. In New England and New York , cottontail, Snowshoe Hare, and White-tailed Deer are the most important prey species. Snowshoe Hare, White-tailed Deer, and North American Porcupine ( Erethizon dorsata) compose over 90% of the winter diet in northern Minnesota. In eastern Nevada and Utah, 69% of the diet is cottontail and Black-tailedJackrabbit. Cottontail, squirrels, cotton rat, Eastern Woodrat ( Neotoma floridana), and mice ( Peromyscus spp.) are important components of diets in Arkansas. Females appear to prefer smaller prey than do males. Where ranges overlap, interference competition between Coyote, Red Fox, Puma , and present species may occur. Likely suffer most severely from this competition, because they show the greatest dependence on a single food source, lagomorphs. In Idaho, Pumas killed them during the winter while defending or stealing food. Activity patterns. Crepuscular and nocturnal activity mostly coincides with peak activity of lagomorphs, their dominant prey. In general, the daily activity pattern is bimodal, with the first period of activity from one hour before sunrise to three hours after sunrise, and the second from three hours before sunset to midnight. In Florida , are most active between 18:00-24:00 h and least active between 12:00-15:00 h. Several studies have reported increases in daylight activity during winter. Adult females with kittens exhibit reduced activity during the first month following birth. However, after kittens are weaned, adult females increase diurnal activity. Usually inactive during periods of extreme heat or severe weather. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary except during the breeding season. A variety of methods are utilized by this species to mark its territory including urine and feces deposition, soil scraping, tree scratching, and scent marking via anal gland secretions. Home range sizes vary with geographic location, sex, prey availability, and in some regions, season. Home ranges at higher latitudes are larger than those from more southern regions. Mean annual home range size for adult males varies from 2: 6 km ? in Alabama to 163 km ? in Idaho . Adult male home ranges often overlap with those of other males and females. Several studies reported that adult male home ranges expand during winter. This is apparently a response to maximizing breeding opportunities and seasonal shifts in prey availability. Adult female home ranges are usually 2-3 times smaller than those of adult males, and range from 1-2 km* in Alabama to 69-7 km® in Idaho . Overlap between adult female home ranges rarely occurs. However, a high level of intra-sex home range overlap was observed in Illinois . Adult females constrict home ranges during the summer due to parturition and kitten rearing. Annual home range sizes can fluctuate over time in response to changing prey densities. For example, adult male and female annual home ranges in south-east Idaho increased from 20-4 km? to 123 km ? and 11-6 km? to 69-7 km? respectively, over a three-year period. These increases were attributed to declining Black-tailed Jackrabbit and Cottontail populations. Nightly movements range between two and 20 km . Young disperse when they are approximately one year old. Dispersal involves a series of nomadic movements punctuated with temporary occupancy of activity areas that can last 60 days.

Present species and L. lynx sometimes considered conspecific. Two subspecies recognized.","L. c. canadensis Kerr, 1792 — mainland Canada and N USA . L. c. subsolanus Bangs, 1897 — NE Canada (Newfoundland I).","Head-body 76.2-106. 7 cm , tail 5-12. 7 cm ; weight 5.0-17. 3 kg . Little geographic variation in size but males larger and heavier than females. In Newfoundland the mean weight of adult males was 10-7 kg (range 6.3-17. 3 kg ) versus 8-6 kg (range 5.0-11. 8 kg ) for adult females. The fur, except for the undersides,is unspotted and the background color is buff-gray. Undersides are white and mottled with black spots. The long, pale-colored belly fur is valued by the garment industry. The winter fur of cats in Newfoundland is thick and silvered over with hoary tips, giving the cat a uniform gray color. In other areas winter pelts are more grayish-brown mixed with buff or pale brown. There are no records of melanistic cats but there are a few records of “blue lynx ”. The cat’s cheeks are fringed with a ruff of long hair. Backs of the ears are black at the base and the tips are adorned with an elongated tuft of black hair. Tail tip is completely black, which distinguishes it from the Bobcat, in which thetip is dark only on the dorsal half. Paws are covered with long, dense fur and feet are large and snowshoe-like, which provides additional support in soft snow. Cat is muscular, leggy, and stands about 48-56 cm high at the shoulder. Hindlimbs are longer than front, giving the cat a tipped-forward appearance.","A variety of forest types within the broad belt of boreal forest that stretches from Alaska to Newfoundland. They are also found in the coniferous forests of the northern Cascade Mountains of Washington and the Rocky Mountains of north-east Utah and central Colorado at elevations above 2700 m . Prey almost exclusively on the Snowshoe Hare and thus the habitats used by the cat coincide with habitats where hares are abundant, especially early successional fire-dependent forests. Mature forests containing tangles of blown-down trees and stumpsare often used for denning sites. In areas where coexists with Bobcats and Coyotes, appears to avoid possible conflicts by using areas at higher elevations and areas with greater snow depth.","Prey extensively on Snowshoe Hares, but their abundance is cyclic and densities can vary enormously during the 8-11 year cycle. Snowshoe Hare numbers may reach 2300 per km? one year and then plummet to as few as 12 per km? a few years later. Regardless, Snowshoe Hares contribute 60 to 97% of the Lynx’s diet and in some areas the cat hunts little else. On Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia , for example, 198 of 200 attempts to capture prey involved Snowshoe Hares. Squirrels and grouse appearas incidental prey in the winter. The appearance of Moose and Deerin scats is probably related to feeding on carrion, since ungulates do not figure prominently in the cat’s diet. Summer diets are more diverse and typically include a greater number of small birds and rodents, but even then Snowshoe Hares contribute more than half of all meat consumed. Different methods are employed to capture prey depending on environmental conditions. In Newfoundland, when Snowshoe Hares were abundant, about 60% of kills were made from ambush, but this method was not effective in Alberta , Canada , when Snowshoe Hare density was low. Neither active searching nor ambushing Snowshoe Hares was more effective during a low in their numbers in the Yukon , but hunted more often from ambush, presumably because this method is more energy efficient when prey are scarce. In an area in southern Yukon with relatively high Snowshoe Hare densities and dense vegetation, Canadian Lynx had little success ambushing Snowshoe Hares. These findings suggest that hunting success is more dependent on stalking conditions than on Snowshoe Hare densities or habitat type. Indeed, even in areas with abundant Snowshoe Hares but where the vegetation is particularly dense, Canadian Lynx may be more successful hunting in open areas where Snowshoe Hare densities are lower. Based on tracking animals in snow, Canadian Lynx kill one Snowshoe Hare per day or one every other day, but capture successis variable. In the Yukon , when Snowshoe Hare numbers were increasing, a Canadian Lynx made six kills in eleven attempts (54-5%). However, when Snowshoe Hare numbers were low the success rates varied from 20-22%. The highest hunting success rates are achieved by groups. One study reported that the success rates for groups of one, two, three and four averaged 14%, 17%, 38% and 55%, respectively. In the Yukon , female-kitten groups killed Snowshoe Hares more frequently than did single cats, but the return per individual was lower. However, in groups comprising accomplished hunters, the return per individual was higher than that of single animals. Hunting successis also related to the distance between the Canadian Lynx and Snowshoe Hare when it begins to run. Results from several studies show Canadian Lynx leaping 1-5 to 2: 5 m per jump, and Canadian Lynx were generally more successful the fewer jumps they had to make. In contrast, a study on Cape Breton Island showed that Canadian Lynx made an average of 11-1 jumps (covering 24 m ) per successful capture compared to 8-4 jumps (covering 16-3 m) for unsuccessful captures. Snowshoe Hares are sometimes eaten where killed and sometimes taken to another site, which may be close by or some distance away. Canadian Lynx on Cape Breton Island initially opened the thoracic cavity of Hares and then fed on the organs, followed by the shoulders and neck. The stomach and intestines were not eaten, nor were the paws. Canadian Lynx consume an estimated 600 g to 1200 g per day, which is equivalent to from one Snowshoe Hare every other day to one per day. Uneaten parts of kills may be cached, covered with leaves or snow, or left uncovered at the site. Caching behavior was related to hunting success; few kills were cached when Snowshoe Hares were difficult to catch. The impact of predation on Snowshoe Hare populations depends on where their populations are in the cycle. Studies in Alberta , Canada , estimate that Canadian Lynx account for 20% of winter losses during a low in the Snowshoe Hare cycle, but during a peak the impact was negligible. Activity patterns. Snowshoe Hares are basically nocturnal and thus Canadian Lynx are primarily nocturnal, although when Snowshoe Hare densities are low, some daytime hunting is not unusual to try to meet their energy requirements. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Lynx may move rapidly between distant parts of their ranges without stopping, but when hunting, the cats zig-zag, cross, and recross areas and inspect patches of cover searching for prey. Travel rates range from 0-75 to 1-45 km/hour and it is not uncommon to cover 8-9 km per day. The distances traveled per day may increase as Snowshoe Hare densities decline. Home range sizes vary from three to 783 km ?but most are relatively small, about 15 to 50 km ?. The home ranges of resident males are commonly larger than those of resident females. Surprisingly, studies in Alberta and the Yukon found no significant correlation between home range size and Snowshoe Hare densities or Canadian Lynx densities. However, studies in other areas suggest that home range sizes are tied to Snowshoe Hare densities and that the home ranges are typically larger in areas where there are few Snowshoe Hares. Home ranges in Washington , Montana , Minnesota , and Manitoba , which represent the southern periphery of the Canadian Lynx’s geographic distribution, tend to be larger (39-243 km?) than elsewhere and densities in these areas are typically low (2-3/ 100 km ?). Furthermore, densities in these marginal areas show little fluctuation, presumably because Snowshoe Hare populations in these areas do not cycle; Snowshoe Hare densities remain low, probably due to predation. Within areas of favorable habitat densities may reach 45/ 100 km ?, which includes adults, yearlings, and kittens. Despite all the field studies on the species, remarkably little is known about the social system of the animal. Canadian Lynx are, like most other felids, solitary and the only prolonged association is between a female and her young. Spatial arrangements are highly variable, and run the gamut from complete home range overlap between Canadian Lynx of the same sex to exclusive ranges for both males and females. In the Northwest Territories most social interactions between Canadian Lynx were classified as neutral, even between individuals whose ranges overlapped extensively. The cyclical nature of the prey base does, however, have a great influence on the Canadian Lynx’s land tenure system. It has been shown that at extremely low Snowshoe Hare densities the system may collapse and Canadian Lynx will abandon their home ranges and wander widely in search of food. During these times, adults suddenly appearin places like North Dakota or Iowa , far from their normal haunts. It is not known if any remain on their ranges during such lows, butit is suggested that a “core population” maintain their territories throughout the cycle. To what extent fur trapping represents another disruptive influence is not well known, but the removal of residents may alter established relationships among neighbors as well as modify the age and sex structure of the population.",,"Snowshoe Hares are basically nocturnal and thus Canadian Lynx are primarily nocturnal, although when Snowshoe Hare densities are low, some daytime hunting is not unusual to try to meet their energy requirements.","Lynx may move rapidly between distant parts of their ranges without stopping, but when hunting, the cats zig-zag, cross, and recross areas and inspect patches of cover searching for prey.

Despite all the field studies on the species, remarkably little is known about the social system of the animal. Canadian Lynx are, like most other felids, solitary and the only prolonged association is between a female and her young. Spatial arrangements are highly variable, and run the gamut from complete home range overlap between Canadian Lynx of the same sex to exclusive ranges for both males and females. In the Northwest Territories most social interactions between Canadian Lynx were classified as neutral, even between individuals whose ranges overlapped extensively. The cyclical nature of the prey base does, however, have a great influence on the Canadian Lynx’s land tenure system. It has been shown that at extremely low Snowshoe Hare densities the system may collapse and Canadian Lynx will abandon their home ranges and wander widely in search of food. During these times, adults suddenly appearin places like North Dakota or Iowa , far from their normal haunts. It is not known if any remain on their ranges during such lows, butit is suggested that a “core population” maintain their territories throughout the cycle. To what extent fur trapping represents another disruptive influence is not well known, but the removal of residents may alter established relationships among neighbors as well as modify the age and sex structure of the population. Breeding. The breeding season is short, lasting about one month. Estrus lasts for 3-5 days, and females probably only have a single annual estrous cycle. They are thought to be induced ovulators, but this may depend on their densities: they may be induced ovulators when mates are scarce and spontaneous ovulators when mates are abundant. Gestation length is about 63-64 days. Litter size ranges from 1-8 and, unlike most other felids, shows considerable flexibility. When Snowshoe Hares are scarce, ovulation rates, pregnancy rates, and litter size decrease; when Snowshoe Hares are abundant these same rates increase. During a peak in Snowshoe Hare density (74/km?) in the Yukon , mean litter size for adult females was 5-3 and for yearling females it was 4-2. When Snowshoe Hare densities declined the following year, adultlitter size decreased to 4-9 and no yearlings reproduced. In the third year, when Snowshoe Hare densities were even lower (13/km?), no adult or yearling produced a litter. During a low in Snowshoe Hare densities in central Alberta , litter size averaged 1-3, but increased to 3-5 as Snowshoe Hare densities increased. At the low in Snowshoe Hare density, only 33% of adult females conceived, compared to 73% when Snowshoe Hares were abundant. Even if females do produce kittens during times of low Snowshoe Hare abundance, infant mortality rates are likely to be high (60-95%), as kittens die of starvation or other nutritional stresses. Mating occurs in most areas from March-April, and young are born in May-June. Birth dens have been found in dense tangles of blown-down trees or under tree roots. The arrival of young is marked by a contraction in the home range of a female, and her movements become focused on the den site. Young weigh about 175-235 g at birth, eyes are closed, and their grayish buffy-furis marked with dark streaks. When Snowshoe Hares are abundant, growth and development are rapid and kittens are weaned by twelve weeks of age. By mid-winter young will weigh 4-5 kg. When Snowshoe Hares are scarce, growth is slowed and few young survive. Young begin following their mother at five weeks and by seven weeks may be actively participating in hunts. Young remain with their mother until they are about ten months old, but they do not reach adult size until they are two years old. When Snowshoe Hares are abundant, females may breed at ten months of age. Otherwise breeding occurs at 22-23 months of age. Males probably do notattain sexual maturity until they are two or three years old. Dispersal from the natal range occurs as early as 10-11 months of age, but most are 16-17 months old when they leave. In one study the mean dispersal distance was 163 km (range 17-930 km) and distances traveled did not differ by sex or age. In another study, eleven dispersers traveled more than 500 km and two others moved more than 1000 km .","CITES Appendix II. Listed as species of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

Canadian Lynx Lynx canadensis French: Lynx du Canada / German: Kanadischer Luchs / Spanish: Lince canadiense Taxonomy. Lynx canadensis Kerr, 1792 , Canada . Present species and L. lynx sometimes considered conspecific. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. L. c. canadensis Kerr, 1792 — mainland Canada and N USA . L. c. subsolanus Bangs, 1897 — NE Canada (Newfoundland I). Descriptive notes. Head-body 76.2-106. 7 cm , tail 5-12. 7 cm ; weight 5.0-17. 3 kg . Little geographic variation in size but males larger and heavier than females. In Newfoundland the mean weight of adult males was 10-7 kg (range 6.3-17. 3 kg ) versus 8-6 kg (range 5.0-11. 8 kg ) for adult females. The fur, except for the undersides,is unspotted and the background color is buff-gray. Undersides are white and mottled with black spots. The long, pale-colored belly fur is valued by the garment industry. The winter fur of cats in Newfoundland is thick and silvered over with hoary tips, giving the cat a uniform gray color. In other areas winter pelts are more grayish-brown mixed with buff or pale brown. There are no records of melanistic cats but there are a few records of “blue lynx ”. The cat’s cheeks are fringed with a ruff of long hair. Backs of the ears are black at the base and the tips are adorned with an elongated tuft of black hair. Tail tip is completely black, which distinguishes it from the Bobcat, in which thetip is dark only on the dorsal half. Paws are covered with long, dense fur and feet are large and snowshoe-like, which provides additional support in soft snow. Cat is muscular, leggy, and stands about 48-56 cm high at the shoulder. Hindlimbs are longer than front, giving the cat a tipped-forward appearance. Habitat. A variety of forest types within the broad belt of boreal forest that stretches from Alaska to Newfoundland. They are also found in the coniferous forests of the northern Cascade Mountains of Washington and the Rocky Mountains of north-east Utah and central Colorado at elevations above 2700 m . Prey almost exclusively on the Snowshoe Hare and thus the habitats used by the cat coincide with habitats where hares are abundant, especially early successional fire-dependent forests. Mature forests containing tangles of blown-down trees and stumpsare often used for denning sites. In areas where coexists with Bobcats and Coyotes, appears to avoid possible conflicts by using areas at higher elevations and areas with greater snow depth. Food and Feeding. Prey extensively on Snowshoe Hares, but their abundance is cyclic and densities can vary enormously during the 8-11 year cycle. Snowshoe Hare numbers may reach 2300 per km? one year and then plummet to as few as 12 per km? a few years later. Regardless, Snowshoe Hares contribute 60 to 97% of the Lynx’s diet and in some areas the cat hunts little else. On Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia , for example, 198 of 200 attempts to capture prey involved Snowshoe Hares. Squirrels and grouse appearas incidental prey in the winter. The appearance of Moose and Deerin scats is probably related to feeding on carrion, since ungulates do not figure prominently in the cat’s diet. Summer diets are more diverse and typically include a greater number of small birds and rodents, but even then Snowshoe Hares contribute more than half of all meat consumed. Different methods are employed to capture prey depending on environmental conditions. In Newfoundland, when Snowshoe Hares were abundant, about 60% of kills were made from ambush, but this method was not effective in Alberta , Canada , when Snowshoe Hare density was low. Neither active searching nor ambushing Snowshoe Hares was more effective during a low in their numbers in the Yukon , but hunted more often from ambush, presumably because this method is more energy efficient when prey are scarce. In an area in southern Yukon with relatively high Snowshoe Hare densities and dense vegetation, Canadian Lynx had little success ambushing Snowshoe Hares. These findings suggest that hunting success is more dependent on stalking conditions than on Snowshoe Hare densities or habitat type. Indeed, even in areas with abundant Snowshoe Hares but where the vegetation is particularly dense, Canadian Lynx may be more successful hunting in open areas where Snowshoe Hare densities are lower. Based on tracking animals in snow, Canadian Lynx kill one Snowshoe Hare per day or one every other day, but capture successis variable. In the Yukon , when Snowshoe Hare numbers were increasing, a Canadian Lynx made six kills in eleven attempts (54-5%). However, when Snowshoe Hare numbers were low the success rates varied from 20-22%. The highest hunting success rates are achieved by groups. One study reported that the success rates for groups of one, two, three and four averaged 14%, 17%, 38% and 55%, respectively. In the Yukon , female-kitten groups killed Snowshoe Hares more frequently than did single cats, but the return per individual was lower. However, in groups comprising accomplished hunters, the return per individual was higher than that of single animals. Hunting successis also related to the distance between the Canadian Lynx and Snowshoe Hare when it begins to run. Results from several studies show Canadian Lynx leaping 1-5 to 2: 5 m per jump, and Canadian Lynx were generally more successful the fewer jumps they had to make. In contrast, a study on Cape Breton Island showed that Canadian Lynx made an average of 11-1 jumps (covering 24 m ) per successful capture compared to 8-4 jumps (covering 16-3 m) for unsuccessful captures. Snowshoe Hares are sometimes eaten where killed and sometimes taken to another site, which may be close by or some distance away. Canadian Lynx on Cape Breton Island initially opened the thoracic cavity of Hares and then fed on the organs, followed by the shoulders and neck. The stomach and intestines were not eaten, nor were the paws. Canadian Lynx consume an estimated 600 g to 1200 g per day, which is equivalent to from one Snowshoe Hare every other day to one per day. Uneaten parts of kills may be cached, covered with leaves or snow, or left uncovered at the site. Caching behavior was related to hunting success; few kills were cached when Snowshoe Hares were difficult to catch. The impact of predation on Snowshoe Hare populations depends on where their populations are in the cycle. Studies in Alberta , Canada , estimate that Canadian Lynx account for 20% of winter losses during a low in the Snowshoe Hare cycle, but during a peak the impact was negligible. Activity patterns. Snowshoe Hares are basically nocturnal and thus Canadian Lynx are primarily nocturnal, although when Snowshoe Hare densities are low, some daytime hunting is not unusual to try to meet their energy requirements. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Lynx may move rapidly between distant parts of their ranges without stopping, but when hunting, the cats zig-zag, cross, and recross areas and inspect patches of cover searching for prey. Travel rates range from 0-75 to 1-45 km/hour and it is not uncommon to cover 8-9 km per day. The distances traveled per day may increase as Snowshoe Hare densities decline. Home range sizes vary from three to 783 km ?but most are relatively small, about 15 to 50 km ?. The home ranges of resident males are commonly larger than those of resident females. Surprisingly, studies in Alberta and the Yukon found no significant correlation between home range size and Snowshoe Hare densities or Canadian Lynx densities. However, studies in other areas suggest that home range sizes are tied to Snowshoe Hare densities and that the home ranges are typically larger in areas where there are few Snowshoe Hares. Home ranges in Washington , Montana , Minnesota , and Manitoba , which represent the southern periphery of the Canadian Lynx’s geographic distribution, tend to be larger (39-243 km?) than elsewhere and densities in these areas are typically low (2-3/ 100 km ?). Furthermore, densities in these marginal areas show little fluctuation, presumably because Snowshoe Hare populations in these areas do not cycle; Snowshoe Hare densities remain low, probably due to predation. Within areas of favorable habitat densities may reach 45/ 100 km ?, which includes adults, yearlings, and kittens. Despite all the field studies on the species, remarkably little is known about the social system of the animal.

Not unexpectedly, the two preferred habitats contained the highest densities of rabbits, the cat’s main prey. More than 90% of daytime rest sites are in thick heather scrub. The presence of permanent water sites and relatively low disturbance by humans are also important components of high quality habitat.","Feed almost exclusively on European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus); unlike Eurasian Lynx , which is principally a predator of small ungulates. In Donana National Park, rabbits contribute 75 to 93% of the diet, but in other areas their diet includes a few other taxa. Fawns and juvenile Fallow Deer and Red Deer form a minor part of the diet in fall and winter, and a variety of small murid rodents, snakes, and lizards are also occasionally taken. Also prey on birds, principally ducks and geese, and red-legged partridge ( Alectoris rufa). In Donana hunt mainly in the open pastures and scrub forest edge between the scrublands and marshes. Kill rabbits with a bite to the base of the skull. Deer are killed by suffocation, with one or more throat bites. Deer kills are dragged into dense cover where they provide food for a single Lynx for several days. Like many othercats, they attempt to conceal kills by raking leaves,soil, and other debris over what remains of the carcass. In captive feeding trials the maintenance diet for a male is estimated at 912 Kcal/day compared to 673 Kcal/day for a female. Feeding solely on rabbits could satisfy these energy requirements with 379 rabbits/year for males and 277 rabbits/year for a non-reproducing female. Activity patterns. Radio-telemetry studies show that are primarily nocturnal, but there is a good deal of individual and seasonal variation. Radio-telemetry studies in Donana found that in summer are primarily nocturnal and activity is high around sunrise and sunset. In winter, were commonly found moving around during the daytime. In general the activity patterns are closely synchronized with its major prey, the rabbit. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Travel extensively and probably visit most parts of their home range every few days. One adult male traveled an average of 9-3 km per day over four 24hour periods; the distances traveled varied from 5-9 km to 13-6 km per night. Males traveled an average of 8-7 km per day compared to 6-4 for females. Based on radio-tracking data, the average home range size of resident males was 10-3 km? and for resident females it was 8-7 km?. The social organization is similar to that of other felids. There is little range overlap for resident animals of the same sex, but male ranges overlap female ranges. Occupancy of ranges is indicated primarily by scent marking, principally with urine and feces. They leave their feces at non-random locations within their ranges, preferring to deposit their scats at intersections of trails and roads.

Mating is thought to begin in January and February, and following a 63-73 day gestation period, kittens are born in March or April. Litter size varies from 1-4, but the most common numberis two. Females with young kittens restrict their movements to a small area around the den site: one female used an area of only 1-7 km® until her kittens were two months old. Young remain in their natal ranges until they disperse at about 20 months of age.","Possibly the most endangered of the world’s felids. Listed on CITES Appendix I and classified as Critically Endangered on the The IUCN Red Lust. Legally protected throughout its range. Between 1960 and 1978 the habitat shrank by some 80%. Agriculture programs and large scale conversion of native forest to pine and eucalyptus plantations in Spain and Portugal , coupled with myxomatosis epidemics among the rabbit population, reduced the population to an estimated 880-1050 animals in Spain , with perhaps another 50 in Portugal . Since then there has been a further reduction in population size and today an estimated 84-143 adults survive in two or three isolated pockets in south-western Spain . Its survival in Portugal is uncertain at present. There are only two known breeding populations in Spain : in the Coto Donana (24-33 adults) and Andujar-Cardena in the eastern Sierra Morena (60-110 adults). These populations are isolated from one another making them even more vulnerable. Estimates of density in Donana varies from 10-18/ 100 km *. The current population exists in small, isolated, and highly fragmented patches of habitat. Few die of natural causes, some 75% of mortality being due to human related activities, such as shooting, poisoning, or trapping. Many are killed while trying to cross roads. After several years of unsuccessful attempts, new efforts are being made to breed them in captivity for possible reintroduction to the wild.","Aldama & Delibes (1991) | Aldama et al.

The presence of permanent water sites and relatively low disturbance by humans are also important components of high quality habitat. Food and Feeding. Feed almost exclusively on European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus); unlike Eurasian Lynx , which is principally a predator of small ungulates. In Donana National Park, rabbits contribute 75 to 93% of the diet, but in other areas their diet includes a few other taxa. Fawns and juvenile Fallow Deer and Red Deer form a minor part of the diet in fall and winter, and a variety of small murid rodents, snakes, and lizards are also occasionally taken. Also prey on birds, principally ducks and geese, and red-legged partridge ( Alectoris rufa). In Donana hunt mainly in the open pastures and scrub forest edge between the scrublands and marshes. Kill rabbits with a bite to the base of the skull. Deer are killed by suffocation, with one or more throat bites. Deer kills are dragged into dense cover where they provide food for a single Lynx for several days. Like many othercats, they attempt to conceal kills by raking leaves,soil, and other debris over what remains of the carcass. In captive feeding trials the maintenance diet for a male is estimated at 912 Kcal/day compared to 673 Kcal/day for a female. Feeding solely on rabbits could satisfy these energy requirements with 379 rabbits/year for males and 277 rabbits/year for a non-reproducing female. Activity patterns. Radio-telemetry studies show that are primarily nocturnal, but there is a good deal of individual and seasonal variation. Radio-telemetry studies in Donana found that in summer are primarily nocturnal and activity is high around sunrise and sunset. In winter, were commonly found moving around during the daytime. In general the activity patterns are closely synchronized with its major prey, the rabbit. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Travel extensively and probably visit most parts of their home range every few days. One adult male traveled an average of 9-3 km per day over four 24hour periods; the distances traveled varied from 5-9 km to 13-6 km per night. Males traveled an average of 8-7 km per day compared to 6-4 for females. Based on radio-tracking data, the average home range size of resident males was 10-3 km? and for resident females it was 8-7 km?. The social organization is similar to that of other felids. There is little range overlap for resident animals of the same sex, but male ranges overlap female ranges. Occupancy of ranges is indicated primarily by scent marking, principally with urine and feces. They leave their feces at non-random locations within their ranges, preferring to deposit their scats at intersections of trails and roads. Apart from females with young and mating pairs, are essentially solitary. Breeding. There are surprisingly few details available on the mating behavior. Mating is thought to begin in January and February, and following a 63-73 day gestation period, kittens are born in March or April. Litter size varies from 1-4, but the most common numberis two. Females with young kittens restrict their movements to a small area around the den site: one female used an area of only 1-7 km® until her kittens were two months old. Young remain in their natal ranges until they disperse at about 20 months of age. Status and Conservation. Possibly the most endangered of the world’s felids. Listed on CITES Appendix I and classified as Critically Endangered on the The IUCN Red Lust. Legally protected throughout its range. Between 1960 and 1978 the habitat shrank by some 80%. Agriculture programs and large scale conversion of native forest to pine and eucalyptus plantations in Spain and Portugal , coupled with myxomatosis epidemics among the rabbit population, reduced the population to an estimated 880-1050 animals in Spain , with perhaps another 50 in Portugal . Since then there has been a further reduction in population size and today an estimated 84-143 adults survive in two or three isolated pockets in south-western Spain . Its survival in Portugal is uncertain at present. There are only two known breeding populations in Spain : in the Coto Donana (24-33 adults) and Andujar-Cardena in the eastern Sierra Morena (60-110 adults). These populations are isolated from one another making them even more vulnerable. Estimates of density in Donana varies from 10-18/ 100 km *. The current population exists in small, isolated, and highly fragmented patches of habitat. Few die of natural causes, some 75% of mortality being due to human related activities, such as shooting, poisoning, or trapping. Many are killed while trying to cross roads. After several years of unsuccessful attempts, new efforts are being made to breed them in captivity for possible reintroduction to the wild. Bibliography. Aldama & Delibes (1991), Aldama et al.

Thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas. In northern latitudes, also roam in the tundra.","In contrast to the three other lynx species, the Eurasian Lynx is not a hunter of lagomorphs, but of smaller ungulates. Although the diet often contains a long list of species, the staple prey is roe deer, chamois (Rupicara), or musk deer. In northern Scandinavia, the most frequent prey is semi-domestic Reindeer. In many areas also prey on livestock, mainly sheep, goats, and farmed Fallow Deer ( Dama dama). Larger prey such as Red Deer, Wild Boar, or ibex is only sporadically taken. In areas where small ungulates are lacking, feed on smaller prey such as hares or grouse. Eat 1.2-5 kg of meat/day, and return to a kill until all edible parts are consumed. Kill 50-70 ungulates/year. Activity patterns. Mainly active during dawn and dusk, but there is no hour during the day with less than 25% activity. In the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland , radio-tagged Eurasian Lynx had a peak in activity between 15:00 and 07:00 h and on average they were active and moving for 6-5 h/day. The majority (73%) of movement by males occurred at night, whereas females were as active during the daytime as they were at night. While the general pattern of activity of females with and without kittens was similar, females with young were active twice as long per day than non-reproducing females. Males were active significantly longer in the mating season (January-March). The length of time of activity on a daily basis varied greatly and depended largely on whether the cat had a kill. On the first day after killing a deer, only active 1-6 h/day, but the time spent moving increased steadily with each day afterwards, reaching 6-8 h/day by the fourth day post-kill and thereafter increasing to as much as12-5 h/day on days when searched for prey but made no kill. Activity was not greatly affected by temperatures and rainfall, except that they moved little on days with heavy rains or when ambient temperatures exceeded 30°C. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Daily movements vary between a few hundred meters and 40 km , but the average from several areas is about 10 km /day. Especially during the mating season, males are roaming far. Eurasian Lynx are solitary animals, except for females with young of the year. Both sexes occupy exclusive territories, with one male usually covering the range of 1-3 females. Home range size varies greatly with the region.

A. j. venaticus Griffith, 1821 — Iran .","Head-body 121-145 cm, tail length 63-76 cm. Mean weight 54 kg (39-59 kg) for males and 43 kg (36-48 kg) for females in Namibia . Shoulder height 79-94 cm. Males average larger than females. Cheetahs of the Sahara are smaller: two adult males had a shoulder height of only 65 cm . Tail about half the head-body length, height at the shoulder accentuated by an erectile crest of hair. Profile of back slightly concave; the hindquarters are lower than the shoulders. Eyes edged with white underneath, iris orange-yellow, pupils round. Ears small and widely set, with black and white markings behind. Head and face are rounded, with characteristic “tear lines”, heavy black lines that extend from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corner of the mouth. Coat of adults is slightly harsh with short hair. Color pale fawn to yellow, darker along the mid-back, covered all over with evenly spaced, small round black spots. Chin, throat and posterior parts of the belly are white. Distal part of the tail is spotted; the spots tend to coalesce into two to three black tail rings; tail tip is white. Front limbs spotted inside and outside, the hindfeet from the ankles to the toes devoid of spots. Top of the head and cheeks finely spotted; pattern of spots individually unique. Both melanistic and albino Cheetah specimens recorded. Remarkably pale animals with short hair, ocher spots, and muted “tear lines” and tail rings are reported from the Sahara. The “ rex ” form has longer, silkier hair with the erectile crest of neck and shoulders up to 7 cm long. Very young Cheetah have extraordinary coloring for camouflage, a mantle of smoky white long hair above, near black below. Their underparts lighten and spots emerge before two months of age, but the pale mantle disappears more slowly and traces of it are still present in animals one year old. The Cheetah is built for speed, with a deep chest, wasp-like waist, and proportionately longer limbs than cats of comparable size. Flexion of elongated spine increases stride length. Canines are small relative to other felids. The reduced roots of the upper canines allow for a larger nasal aperture for increased air intake, critical for allowing the Cheetah to recover from its sprint by “panting” while suffocating its prey for up to 20 minutes. The diastema behind the canines is very small or missing, unique in cats. Adult Cheetah have blunt claws that although retractable, remain exposed, lacking the skin sheaths found in most other felids, providing additional traction like a sprinter’s spikes. Claw marks visible in the spoor. Prominent sharp dew claws, set well up on the front foot, used as hooksto trip up fast-running prey. The digital and metacarpal pads are extremely hard and pointed at the front, an adaptation to sudden braking. Palmar pads with a pair of prominent longitudinal ridges serve as anti-skid devices. Long laterallyflattened tail provides balance as Cheetah swerves during the chase. Enlarged bronchi, lungs,liver, heart, and adrenals. The top of the skull is raised as are the large eyes.","Distributed primarily throughout the drier parts of sub-Saharan Africa, avoiding forest and only thinly distributed in more humid woodland. Most frequently observed on open grassy plains, but may prefer a mosaic of woodland and grassland using bush, scrub, and open woodlands. May expend less energy for hunting with more cover present. Range up to 1500 m in Ethiopia and 2000 m in the mountains of southeast Algeria . Well adapted to arid conditions, surviving in small populations around central Saharan mountain ranges.","Specialized on gazelles and small to medium-sized antelopes as prey. Major prey is Thomson's and Grant's Gazelle, Gerenuk ( Litocranius wallerr), Impala, Lesser Kudu (7 Tragelaphus imberbis), and dik-dik ( Madoqua ) in East Africa; Springbok, Impala, calves of Greater Kudu, Giraffe and even African Buffalo, Southern Reedbuck, Puku ( Kobus vardonii), and Common Warthog in southern Africa; Hartebeest, Oribi (OQurebia ourebi), and Kob in Central Africa. Saharan Cheetahs occasionally take Barbary Sheep and ostrich. In the absence of ungulate prey, Cheetahs may entirely subsist on smaller prey like guineafowl and other ground-living birds and hares, the latter especially in Iran , but male coalitions also bring down large prey like Blue Wildebeest. In all studies, young prey animals are taken in preference to adults. One case of male cannibalism reported. Cheetahs often lose their kills to Lions, Leopards and hyenas. They rarely scavenge or return to a previously abandoned kill; however, may remain near large kills in the absence of more powerful predators on ranchland. The Cheetah starts eating at the hindquarters first. An individual can consume 14 kg at onesitting and a group of four finished an impala carcass in just 15 minutes. This fast swallowing helps to counter loss to competitors. Average meat consumption is 2-4 kg/day. Cheetahs hunt by sight. Prey is often detected from a vantage point. They prefer to stalk toward vigilant adult prey, walking semi-crouched, freezing in mid-stride or crouching if the quarry looks up, to within less than 50 m , before racing out at about 60 km /h. They also wait crouched if they see an unsuspecting prey moving toward them, or walk slowly toward a herd of gazelles in full view, then break into a sprint from 60-70 m away if the herd has not run off. Some rushes are started from as far as 600 m away if prey is grazing or is oblivious to Cheetah’s presence, particularly toward a standing or nursing neonate gazelle. Sprints rarely last longer than 200-300 m, maximum of 600 m . Top speed has been recorded at 102 km /h, strides are up to 9 m , and all four feet are airborne at least twice in each stride. The respiratory rate climbs from 60 to 150 breaths per minute in a high-speed chase. When drawing level with its prey, a Cheetahs knocks an antelope off balance by slapping it with a front paw on the shoulder, rump, or thigh. The dew claws help to secure the prey. The Cheetah then reaches for the throat and clamps the muzzle or windpipe shut with its jaws. Larger prey is suffocated within 2-10 minutes, then the kill is dragged into the nearest shade or cover. Hares are killed with a bite through the head. Hunting success wasslightly over 50% on adult gazelles and was 100% on small fawns in the Serengeti. Single Cheetahs killed prey every 25-60 hours in Nairobi National Park. In Kalahari Desert they travel an average of 82 km between drinks of water, mainly satisfying their moisture requirements by drinking blood or urine of their prey or eating tsamma melons. Activity patterns. Predominantly diurnal, when competing predators like Lions and Spotted Hyenas are less active. Cheetahs spend most of the day resting, with hunting peaks between 07:00 and 10:00 h and between 16:00 and 19:00 h. Cheetahs of the Saharan mountains, in the absence of larger predators, often hunt at night when temperatures are cooler. Territories and preferred routes are marked with sprays of urine, feces, and occasionally by claw raking. Markings are frequently made near regularly used observation points like termitaries, rocks, or leaning trees, so-called “play trees”, or at path junctions. Cheetahs purr when greeting known individuals; the striking contact call is an explosive yelp that can carry for 2 km . Juveniles make a “whirr”, or fast growl, which may rise to a squeal or subside to a rasp during fights over a kill. Bird-like chirps, hums, purrs, and yelps are unique to this species, which can be very vocalin its rare social encounters. Movements, Home range and Social organization. A greater degree of sociality has been observed among Cheetahs than for most felids, with the exception of the Lion. Male and female littermates tend to stay together for about six months after independence, when female young split off upon reaching sexual maturity. Male littermates remain together in coalitions and sometimes defend territories. Male coalitions in the Serengeti, in particular trios, may include unrelated males. Males in coalitions are more likely than solitary males to gain and maintain territories; they are in better condition and have better access to females during periods of gazelle concentration. Nonterritorial males, representing 40% of the Serengeti male population, live a nomadic existence and wander widely. Groups of up to 14-19 animals occasionally reported where other large predators have been eradicated. On some occasions groups of adults with cubs have been reported. Groups of mixed sex have been seen hunting together, probably reflecting mating activity and a large litterjust before independence. Solitary Serengeti males and female adults are semi-nomadic, with large, overlapping home ranges 800-1500 km? male coalitions defend territories of 12-36 km?, but up to 150 km ?. Mortality of adult male Cheetah is as high as 50% as a result of competition for territories. Territories are centered around areas with periodically high Thomson's Gazelle numbers, attracting females to their favorite prey. In Kruger National Park, South Africa , where prey species are non-migratory, both males and females occupy small home ranges of similar size, on average 175 km .",,"Predominantly diurnal, when competing predators like Lions and Spotted Hyenas are less active.

Territories are centered around areas with periodically high Thomson's Gazelle numbers, attracting females to their favorite prey. In Kruger National Park, South Africa , where prey species are non-migratory, both males and females occupy small home ranges of similar size, on average 175 km . Breeding. Largely aseasonal with birth peaks during the rainy season (November— May) in Serengeti. Cheetahs have a long, drawn out, and complex courtship. Females are polyestrous, cycling approximately every twelve days (range 3-27). Length of estrus varies from 1-3 days, being shorter when mating occurs; there are some reports of females being receptive for 10-14 days. Cheetahs are induced ovulators. Mating lasts a minute or more and can be followed by gaps of eight hours before the next episode. Gestation lasts 92 days (range 90-98). Littersize averages four (range 1-8), larger than in most other felids, with larger litters in Namibian rangeland in absence of larger predators. Interbirth interval 15-19 months, but females readily go into estrus and conceive after losing a litter. Large litter size may be a strategy to offset high juvenile mortality caused by predators. Birth weight is 250-300 g. Sex ratio is 1 male: 0-95 female. The blind, helpless cubs are born in a lair of long grass, thickets, or in a temporary “borrowed” burrow and remain hidden for approximately eight weeks. They open their eyes at 4-14 days and are frequently carried to a fresh hiding place by the mother. At 3-6 weeks a set of milk teeth erupts, replaced by adult teeth at about eight months. Cheetah cubs can retract their claws for up to ten weeks of age, and they are able tree climbers. Nursing terminates at about four months. The cubs accompany their mothers on hunts from eight weeks onward and are introduced to solid food. They are very playful during the first six months, starting to practice hunting afterwards, but are still not adept when leaving their mothers. Mothers sometimes bring back live prey for the cubs to practice their skills. Cub mortality up to the age of three monthsis very high. Cubs are killed by other large carnivores and even baboons ( Papio sp.). In Nairobi National Park, cub mortality is as low as 43%. In the Serengeti, with high Lion density, 95% of 125 cubs failed to survive to independence; 73% of the cub deaths were due to predation. Cubs become independent at 18 months (range 13-20 months), while females leave their sibling groups with 17-27 months. Sex ratio of subadults and adults changes to 1 male: 1-9 females, suggesting differential male dispersal and mortality. Wild female Cheetah reproduce at 2-3 years for the first time, and males reproduce at 2-5-3 years. In captivity males are normally fertile at 1-2 years, females at 2-3 years. Females remain fertile up to ten years, males up to 14 years. Longevity in the wild is up to 14 years; however, the female average in the Serengetiis seven years. Territorial males may live longer than single males. Captive Cheetahs live on average 10-5 and up to 21 years. Difficult to breed in captivity, with females conceiving infrequently, but social setting may not be adequate. High levels of sperm abnormalities (71-76%) in both wild and captive Cheetahs, but no evidence that reproduction is compromised in the wild. Cheetahs were kept by nobility and trained to hunt dating back 5000 years to the Sumerians. 3000 Cheetahs were kept during the lifetime of one Moghul emperor. By the early 1900s Indian Cheetahs were so scarce that African animals were imported to sustain the stables, as there was no success breeding them. On following pages: 26. Jaguarundi ( Puma yagouaround)); 27. Puma ( Puma concolor ).","CITES Appendix I, quota system for live animals and trophies in some southern African countries. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List, with subspecies venaticus and hecki classified as Critically Endangered. Population estimate for sub-Saharan Africa was 15,000 in the 1970s, 9000-12,000 in the 1990s. Two largest meta-populations occur in East Africa ( Kenya , Tanzania , Ethiopia ) and southern Africa ( Namibia , Botswana , Zimbabwe , Zambia ). Cheetahs are very rare in Sahel and semi-arid zone of West Africa, much of it having been degraded by humans through hunting of prey animals and livestock overgrazing. Extinct from 20 countries. Possibly present in low numbers in isolated Qattara Depression in N Egypt . Subspecies venaticus has largely been exterminated from Near East and Asia, with possibly fewer than 50 individuals surviving in north-central Iran . About 95% of present Namibian population of 2000-3000 occurs on privately owned land; number of Cheetah believed to have declined by half in Namibia since 1980. Cheetah densities may range from a high density of one adult per 6 km ? following concentrations of migratory gazelle, to low density areas of one adult per 191 km ®. Cheetahs exist in higher densities in pastoral areas outside of protected areas than inside them. On Namibian ranchland, the species’ stronghold, average is one adult per 50 km *. Genetic research demonstrated a very high level of homogeneity in coding DNA, suggesting a series of population bottlenecks in its history, the first and most significant occurring 10,000 years ago. Lack of genetic diversity may render the Cheetah exceptionally vulnerable to changing environmental conditions and disease. In captivity, epidemics of infectious disease have occurred, with high mortality. No epidemics reported from the wild, although high incidence of mange in some parks. Strategy of relying solely upon the limited system of protected areas within the Cheetah’s range may not be sufficient to ensure conservation, due to the impact of other predators, which kill offspring and drive Cheetahs off their kills. Outside protected areas in Namibia , there are conflicts with people over predation on livestock: annual losses of 10-15% for sheep and goats and 3-5% for cattle calves are reported. Stock losses are especially severe where natural prey base has been eliminated or reduced. Cheetahs are not especially susceptible to taking poisoned bait, but their numbers in Namibia have been reduced through shooting and trapping at “play trees”. Permitting trophy hunting in southern Africa has the goal of encouraging landowners to accept and profit from Cheetahs on their lands. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) work to educate farmers about appropriate management steps to minimize stock losses, such as using fencing, guard dogs, and donkeys, to aid in the conservation of the wild prey base and to protect its habitat.","Bertram (1979) | Bosman & Hall-Martin (1997) | Bothma (1998) | Bottriel (1987) | Broomhall et al.

Felis jubata Schreber, 1775 , Western Cape Province , South Africa . A single-locus genetic mutation produces the blotched tabby pattern of the so-called King Cheetah, once classified as a separate species, A. rex , its distribution restricted to the more densely vegetated areas of southern Africa, centered on Zimbabwe , with an isolated record from West Africa. Described race raddei merged with venaticus. Races mngorongoroensis, oberg, raineyi, and velox included in fearonui. Five subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. A. j. jubatus Schreber, 1775 — S Africa. A. j. fearonii A. Smith, 1834 — E Africa. A. j. hecki Hilzheimer, 1913 — NW Africa. A. j. soemmeringui Fitzinger, 1855 — Somalia to Lake Tchad . A. j. venaticus Griffith, 1821 — Iran . Descriptive notes. Head-body 121-145 cm, tail length 63-76 cm. Mean weight 54 kg (39-59 kg) for males and 43 kg (36-48 kg) for females in Namibia . Shoulder height 79-94 cm. Males average larger than females. Cheetahs of the Sahara are smaller: two adult males had a shoulder height of only 65 cm . Tail about half the head-body length, height at the shoulder accentuated by an erectile crest of hair. Profile of back slightly concave; the hindquarters are lower than the shoulders. Eyes edged with white underneath, iris orange-yellow, pupils round. Ears small and widely set, with black and white markings behind. Head and face are rounded, with characteristic “tear lines”, heavy black lines that extend from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corner of the mouth. Coat of adults is slightly harsh with short hair. Color pale fawn to yellow, darker along the mid-back, covered all over with evenly spaced, small round black spots. Chin, throat and posterior parts of the belly are white. Distal part of the tail is spotted; the spots tend to coalesce into two to three black tail rings; tail tip is white. Front limbs spotted inside and outside, the hindfeet from the ankles to the toes devoid of spots. Top of the head and cheeks finely spotted; pattern of spots individually unique. Both melanistic and albino Cheetah specimens recorded. Remarkably pale animals with short hair, ocher spots, and muted “tear lines” and tail rings are reported from the Sahara. The “ rex ” form has longer, silkier hair with the erectile crest of neck and shoulders up to 7 cm long. Very young Cheetah have extraordinary coloring for camouflage, a mantle of smoky white long hair above, near black below. Their underparts lighten and spots emerge before two months of age, but the pale mantle disappears more slowly and traces of it are still present in animals one year old. The Cheetah is built for speed, with a deep chest, wasp-like waist, and proportionately longer limbs than cats of comparable size. Flexion of elongated spine increases stride length. Canines are small relative to other felids. The reduced roots of the upper canines allow for a larger nasal aperture for increased air intake, critical for allowing the Cheetah to recover from its sprint by “panting” while suffocating its prey for up to 20 minutes. The diastema behind the canines is very small or missing, unique in cats. Adult Cheetah have blunt claws that although retractable, remain exposed, lacking the skin sheaths found in most other felids, providing additional traction like a sprinter’s spikes. Claw marks visible in the spoor. Prominent sharp dew claws, set well up on the front foot, used as hooksto trip up fast-running prey. The digital and metacarpal pads are extremely hard and pointed at the front, an adaptation to sudden braking. Palmar pads with a pair of prominent longitudinal ridges serve as anti-skid devices. Long laterallyflattened tail provides balance as Cheetah swerves during the chase. Enlarged bronchi, lungs,liver, heart, and adrenals. The top of the skull is raised as are the large eyes. Habitat. Distributed primarily throughout the drier parts of sub-Saharan Africa, avoiding forest and only thinly distributed in more humid woodland. Most frequently observed on open grassy plains, but may prefer a mosaic of woodland and grassland using bush, scrub, and open woodlands. May expend less energy for hunting with more cover present. Range up to 1500 m in Ethiopia and 2000 m in the mountains of southeast Algeria . Well adapted to arid conditions, surviving in small populations around central Saharan mountain ranges. Food and Feeding. Specialized on gazelles and small to medium-sized antelopes as prey. Major prey is Thomson's and Grant's Gazelle, Gerenuk ( Litocranius wallerr), Impala, Lesser Kudu (7 Tragelaphus imberbis), and dik-dik ( Madoqua ) in East Africa; Springbok, Impala, calves of Greater Kudu, Giraffe and even African Buffalo, Southern Reedbuck, Puku ( Kobus vardonii), and Common Warthog in southern Africa; Hartebeest, Oribi (OQurebia ourebi), and Kob in Central Africa. Saharan Cheetahs occasionally take Barbary Sheep and ostrich. In the absence of ungulate prey, Cheetahs may entirely subsist on smaller prey like guineafowl and other ground-living birds and hares, the latter especially in Iran , but male coalitions also bring down large prey like Blue Wildebeest. In all studies, young prey animals are taken in preference to adults. One case of male cannibalism reported. Cheetahs often lose their kills to Lions, Leopards and hyenas. They rarely scavenge or return to a previously abandoned kill; however, may remain near large kills in the absence of more powerful predators on ranchland. The Cheetah starts eating at the hindquarters first. An individual can consume 14 kg at onesitting and a group of four finished an impala carcass in just 15 minutes. This fast swallowing helps to counter loss to competitors. Average meat consumption is 2-4 kg/day. Cheetahs hunt by sight. Prey is often detected from a vantage point. They prefer to stalk toward vigilant adult prey, walking semi-crouched, freezing in mid-stride or crouching if the quarry looks up, to within less than 50 m , before racing out at about 60 km /h. They also wait crouched if they see an unsuspecting prey moving toward them, or walk slowly toward a herd of gazelles in full view, then break into a sprint from 60-70 m away if the herd has not run off. Some rushes are started from as far as 600 m away if prey is grazing or is oblivious to Cheetah’s presence, particularly toward a standing or nursing neonate gazelle. Sprints rarely last longer than 200-300 m, maximum of 600 m . Top speed has been recorded at 102 km /h, strides are up to 9 m , and all four feet are airborne at least twice in each stride. The respiratory rate climbs from 60 to 150 breaths per minute in a high-speed chase. When drawing level with its prey, a Cheetahs knocks an antelope off balance by slapping it with a front paw on the shoulder, rump, or thigh. The dew claws help to secure the prey. The Cheetah then reaches for the throat and clamps the muzzle or windpipe shut with its jaws. Larger prey is suffocated within 2-10 minutes, then the kill is dragged into the nearest shade or cover. Hares are killed with a bite through the head. Hunting success wasslightly over 50% on adult gazelles and was 100% on small fawns in the Serengeti. Single Cheetahs killed prey every 25-60 hours in Nairobi National Park. In Kalahari Desert they travel an average of 82 km between drinks of water, mainly satisfying their moisture requirements by drinking blood or urine of their prey or eating tsamma melons. Activity patterns. Predominantly diurnal, when competing predators like Lions and Spotted Hyenas are less active. Cheetahs spend most of the day resting, with hunting peaks between 07:00 and 10:00 h and between 16:00 and 19:00 h. Cheetahs of the Saharan mountains, in the absence of larger predators, often hunt at night when temperatures are cooler. Territories and preferred routes are marked with sprays of urine, feces, and occasionally by claw raking. Markings are frequently made near regularly used observation points like termitaries, rocks, or leaning trees, so-called “play trees”, or at path junctions. Cheetahs purr when greeting known individuals; the striking contact call is an explosive yelp that can carry for 2 km . Juveniles make a “whirr”, or fast growl, which may rise to a squeal or subside to a rasp during fights over a kill. Bird-like chirps, hums, purrs, and yelps are unique to this species, which can be very vocalin its rare social encounters. Movements, Home range and Social organization. A greater degree of sociality has been observed among Cheetahs than for most felids, with the exception of the Lion. Male and female littermates tend to stay together for about six months after independence, when female young split off upon reaching sexual maturity. Male littermates remain together in coalitions and sometimes defend territories. Male coalitions in the Serengeti, in particular trios, may include unrelated males. Males in coalitions are more likely than solitary males to gain and maintain territories; they are in better condition and have better access to females during periods of gazelle concentration. Nonterritorial males, representing 40% of the Serengeti male population, live a nomadic existence and wander widely. Groups of up to 14-19 animals occasionally reported where other large predators have been eradicated. On some occasions groups of adults with cubs have been reported. Groups of mixed sex have been seen hunting together, probably reflecting mating activity and a large litterjust before independence. Solitary Serengeti males and female adults are semi-nomadic, with large, overlapping home ranges 800-1500 km? male coalitions defend territories of 12-36 km?, but up to 150 km ?. Mortality of adult male Cheetah is as high as 50% as a result of competition for territories. Territories are centered around areas with periodically high Thomson's Gazelle numbers, attracting females to their favorite prey. In Kruger National Park, South Africa , where prey species are non-migratory, both males and females occupy small home ranges of similar size, on average 175 km . Breeding.

Regardless, a taxonomic revision 1s needed for this species and its many recognized races. Earlier taxonomic work based upon phenotypic characters formed the basis for the recognition and classification ofat least thirty subspecies.","P. c. concolor Linnaeus, 1771 — E Venezuela through the Guianas to lower Amazonian Brazil .

An exceptionally large male weighed 120 kg . Mass at birth is about 0-6 kg. Growth rates are similar for both males and females. Puma are large, slender cats, tawny above and whitish below. Melanism has been reported rarely in South America, but not in North America. Kittens are buffcolored, with rows of irregularly-shaped black spots until 9-12 months old. Thetail of the adult is a long and sweeping “|” that is tipped in dark brown to black hair. Puma have proportionally the longest rear legs in the Felidae . Hair length, color, and texture vary geographically throughout the species’ range in the Western Hemisphere. Individuals from colder, higher altitudes tend to have thicker and longer hair than those from more tropical climates. Dentition follows the typical felid pattern of prominent canines, modest incisors, and sharp carnassial cheek teeth for shearing tendons and bones. Puma exhibit a range of vocalizations, which are infrequently heard but may be associated with mating behavior. These include bird-like chirps that appear to be used by females to communicate with kittens, and the more stereotypical scream, which is likely related to mating behavior. Unlike the great cats, the Puma is unable to roar, a product of reduced larynx and hyoid apparatus. The prevalence of a crooked tail, atrial septal defects, a dorsal whorl of hair, and other anomalies in the Florida subspecies (coryi)is likely a product of reduced population size and several generations of inbreeding. Interestingly, all of these anomalies were absent from young born of matings between Texas female Pumas and Florida Panther males. Seven Texas female Pumas were inserted into the Florida Panther population as part of a genetic augmentation effort in 1995; five of these females were known to have reared at least two litters each.","The Pumais usually associated with remote, rugged terrain where there is cover for stalking and ambush-hunting, secure places to establish natal dens, and at least one species of abundant deersized prey. It has been suggested that viable populations of Puma are impossible without at least one species of deer-sized prey. Its extensive distribution throughout the Western Hemisphere, from sea level to more than 4000 m elevation, suggests a tolerance of environmental conditions that is rare among mammals. Habitat use can be highly seasonal where prey species such as Elk migrate altitudinally in response to snowfall, or can be annually static, for example, in subtropical southern Florida , where prey species have stable annual home ranges. Specific habitat preferences are as variable as the regions in which the Puma lives, and range from mixed conifer and curlleaf mountain mahogany vegetation in rugged topography in Wyoming to subtropical hardwood hammocks, pine flatwoods, and palm forests in southern Florida . Female Puma locate secretive natal dens in boulder piles, dense vegetation, or other natural structures that provide some protection from the elements and reduce detection by potential predators. In Florida these sites tended to be at least one km from a paved road, and were usually located within dense thickets of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), which provided vertical cover, horizontal cover, and reduced temperatures compared to outside air. Where the species is dependent upon forest, occupied areas tend to be at least 20,000 ha without major roads. The species increasingly is found in landscape patches that have been fragmented by expanding human activity and infrastructure such as highways, ranches, produce farms, human settlements, and extractive industries. In these areas, remnant landscape connections and restored habitat corridors can be important demographic linkages. In Florida and California dispersing individuals are tolerant of habitat that may include canals, highways, relatively open terrain, and other features that are usually recognized as barriers by resident adults.","The Puma’s extensive distribution is reflected in a diverse list of prey. In general, Puma from temperate climates eat larger prey than Puma from tropical climates, and solitary adults tend to eat larger prey than females with kittens. The smaller prey size of Puma in the tropics may be the result of niche separation with the larger, socially dominantJaguar. Puma are ambush hunters; they utilize cover to closely approach potential prey before an attack is made. Common prey in North America include Elk, White-tailed Deer, Mule Deer, Wild Boar, Collared Peccary, porcupines, rabbits, and hares. In South America common prey include vizcacha, Guanaco (Lama guanicoe), brocket deer, Pampas Deer ( Ozotoceros bezoarticus), pudu ( Pudu ), agouti, armadillo, and porcupine. Domestic stock is occasionally taken throughout the species’ range, and exotic species such as Wild Boar and European Hare can be important dietary components even where larger prey are available. In marginal habitat such as in the Everglades of southern Florida , atypical prey such as alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) and North American River Otter may be taken. This is the result of inherently low populations of White-tailed Deer in the Everglades region. Puma routinely remove the entrails of large prey before caching and burying their kills with leaves and other debris for future use. The use of such kills may last from one to 27 days. Humans can alter the abundance and spatial use patterns of Puma and their prey through hunting and otheractivities. Historically, Puma predation on humans has been rare, although in recent years there has been an apparent increase in encounters, especially involving juvenile or underweight cats. Many of these attacks have occurred in the urbanwilderness interface where the likelihood of an encounter increases with presence of humans in occupied peripheral Puma habitat. Activity patterns. Puma are primarily crepuscular and nocturnal and do the bulk of traveling and hunting at night. This pattern appears related to the activity of their prey and the concealment offered by darkness. In Florida , activity peaks occurred from 01:00-07:00 h and 18:00-22:00 h. Females with kittens tended to leave their natal dens to hunt at 22:00 h and return to them at 08:00 h. Activity patterns of females at natal dens were similar to those of solitary adults, but exhibited less difference between activity peaks and nadirs. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Puma exist in a system of dynamic land tenure: resident adults have prior rights to home ranges, and residency is dependent upon the death or departure of other residents. Annual home range size varies from 50 to more than 1000 km ? and appears to be related to primary productivity and prey abundance. Movement distances greater than 20 km in a 24hour period have been recorded. Male home ranges are generally more than twice as large as female home ranges, and tend to incorporate as many females as possible within a territory boundary that is not continually defended. Males tend to use their larger home ranges evenly across seasons, whereas female movements are related to reproductive condition and the presence of kittens. Females restrict their movements to the immediate vicinity of natal dens for about two months, after which time kittens join their mothers at kills. Aggressive encounters between males appear to be contests for breeding rights and often result in the death or injury of at least one of the combatants. The basic social unit ofthis solitary speciesis the female-kitten group, which lasts for 10-24 months. Independence of offspring may be related to onset of estrus in the female and subsequent sexual encounters with adult males. In Florida , independence ofjuveniles was preceded by encounters between the mother and an adult male in 63% of 27 documented instances. Females are philopatric and tend to establish home ranges adjacentto those of their mothers. In Florida , dispersal distances ranged from six to 32 km in females and from 24 to 224 km in males. In Wyoming , a male dispersed 274 km . Females are capable of long-distance dispersal, but seldom do so. Translocated individuals have been known to return to capture locations from more than 470 km away.",,"Puma are primarily crepuscular and nocturnal and do the bulk of traveling and hunting at night.

Translocated individuals have been known to return to capture locations from more than 470 km away. Breeding. Puma reproduction can occur year-round,varies regionally, and, if seasonal, appears to be linked to the reproductive patterns of primary prey. For example, in Florida , reproduction has occurred in every month, but most litters are born in the spring, after the pulse of White-tailed Deer fawn production. Gestation varies from 92-96 days,following a bout of copulations that maylast several days. Adult males may be aspermatic for portions of the year. In Florida , despite poor sperm quality, reduced genetic variability seems insufficient to limit population growth. Litter size averages two and ranges from one to four. Earliest documentation offirst reproduction in the species is 18 months for females. Males generally begin breeding after three years, although sexual maturity is likely attained at or before two years.","The Puma is listed on Appendix II of CITES with the subspecies coryi, costaricensis, and cougar listed on Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. In North America Puma inhabit less than 50% of their original range, primarily due to the loss of habitat and intensive human activities. A similar pattern likely pertains in Central and South America where deforestation is occurring at a rapid pace. In North America legal status varies: the Puma is an unregulated predator in Texas; a hunted species with distinct seasons in Nevada, Montana, and Alberta , Canada ; a non-hunted species in California and Manitoba , Canada . The Puma is fully protected in Florida. Races cougar and schorgeri are probably extinct whereas coryz, costaricensis, and brownii are listed as threatened or endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. In South America Puma hunting is prohibited in Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , French Guiana , Guatemala , Honduras , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Surinam , Venezuela , and Uruguay ; it is unprotected in Ecuador , El Salvador , and Guyana . The Puma can be hunted in Mexico and Peru . Small population size has resulted in reduced genetic variability and maladaptive physiological traits such as atrial septal defects in coryi. However,there is no evidence that such phenotypic characters have negatively affected demographics in the population. Efforts to save the Florida Puma include experimental translocations and genetic introgression via the transport of female Puma from Texas. The Puma , like other large carnivores, is an effective conservation flagship because it requires large areas, exhibits top-down regulation, and can be popular with the public. A landscape approach to the conservation of this species will be important in maintaining both large and small populations because the species occurs at inherently low densities. Successful management and recovery strategies for Puma will require local and regional planning to balance expanding human populations and infrastructure development with habitat restoration. Land management policies that enhance prey populations and offer the Puma interconnected reserve systems are needed. Efforts to create blueprints for such large-scale conservation include Paseo Pantera (Wildlife Conservation Society) in Central and South America and the Florida Ecological Network.","Ackerman et al.

Puma Puma concolor French: Couguar / German: Puma / Spanish: Puma Other common names: Cougar , Mountain Lion , Catamount , Panther; Florida Panther (coryi) Taxonomy. Felis concolor Linnaeus, 1771 , Cayenne region, French Guiana . In the Western Hemisphere the Puma ranges from Patagonia to northern British Columbia , a span of about 100 degrees of latitude. Recent analyses based upon mitochondrial gene sequences suggest the North American Puma derived from a small number of founders about 10,000 years ago and that sufficient genomic differentiation exists to support the recognition of two subspecies in the Western Hemisphere. Regardless, a taxonomic revision 1s needed for this species and its many recognized races. Earlier taxonomic work based upon phenotypic characters formed the basis for the recognition and classification ofat least thirty subspecies. Subspecies and Distribution.

Average weight ranges from 53-72 kg for adult males, and 34-48 kg for adult females. An exceptionally large male weighed 120 kg . Mass at birth is about 0-6 kg. Growth rates are similar for both males and females. Puma are large, slender cats, tawny above and whitish below. Melanism has been reported rarely in South America, but not in North America. Kittens are buffcolored, with rows of irregularly-shaped black spots until 9-12 months old. Thetail of the adult is a long and sweeping “|” that is tipped in dark brown to black hair. Puma have proportionally the longest rear legs in the Felidae . Hair length, color, and texture vary geographically throughout the species’ range in the Western Hemisphere. Individuals from colder, higher altitudes tend to have thicker and longer hair than those from more tropical climates. Dentition follows the typical felid pattern of prominent canines, modest incisors, and sharp carnassial cheek teeth for shearing tendons and bones. Puma exhibit a range of vocalizations, which are infrequently heard but may be associated with mating behavior. These include bird-like chirps that appear to be used by females to communicate with kittens, and the more stereotypical scream, which is likely related to mating behavior. Unlike the great cats, the Puma is unable to roar, a product of reduced larynx and hyoid apparatus. The prevalence of a crooked tail, atrial septal defects, a dorsal whorl of hair, and other anomalies in the Florida subspecies (coryi)is likely a product of reduced population size and several generations of inbreeding. Interestingly, all of these anomalies were absent from young born of matings between Texas female Pumas and Florida Panther males. Seven Texas female Pumas were inserted into the Florida Panther population as part of a genetic augmentation effort in 1995; five of these females were known to have reared at least two litters each. Habitat. The Pumais usually associated with remote, rugged terrain where there is cover for stalking and ambush-hunting, secure places to establish natal dens, and at least one species of abundant deersized prey. It has been suggested that viable populations of Puma are impossible without at least one species of deer-sized prey. Its extensive distribution throughout the Western Hemisphere, from sea level to more than 4000 m elevation, suggests a tolerance of environmental conditions that is rare among mammals. Habitat use can be highly seasonal where prey species such as Elk migrate altitudinally in response to snowfall, or can be annually static, for example, in subtropical southern Florida , where prey species have stable annual home ranges. Specific habitat preferences are as variable as the regions in which the Puma lives, and range from mixed conifer and curlleaf mountain mahogany vegetation in rugged topography in Wyoming to subtropical hardwood hammocks, pine flatwoods, and palm forests in southern Florida . Female Puma locate secretive natal dens in boulder piles, dense vegetation, or other natural structures that provide some protection from the elements and reduce detection by potential predators. In Florida these sites tended to be at least one km from a paved road, and were usually located within dense thickets of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), which provided vertical cover, horizontal cover, and reduced temperatures compared to outside air. Where the species is dependent upon forest, occupied areas tend to be at least 20,000 ha without major roads. The species increasingly is found in landscape patches that have been fragmented by expanding human activity and infrastructure such as highways, ranches, produce farms, human settlements, and extractive industries. In these areas, remnant landscape connections and restored habitat corridors can be important demographic linkages. In Florida and California dispersing individuals are tolerant of habitat that may include canals, highways, relatively open terrain, and other features that are usually recognized as barriers by resident adults. Food and Feeding. The Puma’s extensive distribution is reflected in a diverse list of prey. In general, Puma from temperate climates eat larger prey than Puma from tropical climates, and solitary adults tend to eat larger prey than females with kittens. The smaller prey size of Puma in the tropics may be the result of niche separation with the larger, socially dominantJaguar. Puma are ambush hunters; they utilize cover to closely approach potential prey before an attack is made. Common prey in North America include Elk, White-tailed Deer, Mule Deer, Wild Boar, Collared Peccary, porcupines, rabbits, and hares. In South America common prey include vizcacha, Guanaco (Lama guanicoe), brocket deer, Pampas Deer ( Ozotoceros bezoarticus), pudu ( Pudu ), agouti, armadillo, and porcupine. Domestic stock is occasionally taken throughout the species’ range, and exotic species such as Wild Boar and European Hare can be important dietary components even where larger prey are available. In marginal habitat such as in the Everglades of southern Florida , atypical prey such as alligator (Alligator mississipiensis) and North American River Otter may be taken. This is the result of inherently low populations of White-tailed Deer in the Everglades region. Puma routinely remove the entrails of large prey before caching and burying their kills with leaves and other debris for future use. The use of such kills may last from one to 27 days. Humans can alter the abundance and spatial use patterns of Puma and their prey through hunting and otheractivities. Historically, Puma predation on humans has been rare, although in recent years there has been an apparent increase in encounters, especially involving juvenile or underweight cats. Many of these attacks have occurred in the urbanwilderness interface where the likelihood of an encounter increases with presence of humans in occupied peripheral Puma habitat. Activity patterns. Puma are primarily crepuscular and nocturnal and do the bulk of traveling and hunting at night. This pattern appears related to the activity of their prey and the concealment offered by darkness. In Florida , activity peaks occurred from 01:00-07:00 h and 18:00-22:00 h. Females with kittens tended to leave their natal dens to hunt at 22:00 h and return to them at 08:00 h. Activity patterns of females at natal dens were similar to those of solitary adults, but exhibited less difference between activity peaks and nadirs. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Puma exist in a system of dynamic land tenure: resident adults have prior rights to home ranges, and residency is dependent upon the death or departure of other residents. Annual home range size varies from 50 to more than 1000 km ? and appears to be related to primary productivity and prey abundance. Movement distances greater than 20 km in a 24hour period have been recorded. Male home ranges are generally more than twice as large as female home ranges, and tend to incorporate as many females as possible within a territory boundary that is not continually defended. Males tend to use their larger home ranges evenly across seasons, whereas female movements are related to reproductive condition and the presence of kittens. Females restrict their movements to the immediate vicinity of natal dens for about two months, after which time kittens join their mothers at kills. Aggressive encounters between males appear to be contests for breeding rights and often result in the death or injury of at least one of the combatants. The basic social unit ofthis solitary speciesis the female-kitten group, which lasts for 10-24 months. Independence of offspring may be related to onset of estrus in the female and subsequent sexual encounters with adult males. In Florida , independence ofjuveniles was preceded by encounters between the mother and an adult male in 63% of 27 documented instances. Females are philopatric and tend to establish home ranges adjacentto those of their mothers. In Florida , dispersal distances ranged from six to 32 km in females and from 24 to 224 km in males. In Wyoming , a male dispersed 274 km . Females are capable of long-distance dispersal, but seldom do so. Translocated individuals have been known to return to capture locations from more than 470 km away. Breeding. Puma reproduction can occur year-round,varies regionally, and, if seasonal, appears to be linked to the reproductive patterns of primary prey. For example, in Florida , reproduction has occurred in every month, but most litters are born in the spring, after the pulse of White-tailed Deer fawn production. Gestation varies from 92-96 days,following a bout of copulations that maylast several days. Adult males may be aspermatic for portions of the year. In Florida , despite poor sperm quality, reduced genetic variability seems insufficient to limit population growth. Litter size averages two and ranges from one to four. Earliest documentation offirst reproduction in the species is 18 months for females. Males generally begin breeding after three years, although sexual maturity is likely attained at or before two years. Status and Conservation. The Puma is listed on Appendix II of CITES with the subspecies coryi, costaricensis, and cougar listed on Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. In North America Puma inhabit less than 50% of their original range, primarily due to the loss of habitat and intensive human activities. A similar pattern likely pertains in Central and South America where deforestation is occurring at a rapid pace. In North America legal status varies: the Puma is an unregulated predator in Texas; a hunted species with distinct seasons in Nevada, Montana, and Alberta , Canada ; a non-hunted species in California and Manitoba , Canada . The Puma is fully protected in Florida. Races cougar and schorgeri are probably extinct whereas coryz, costaricensis, and brownii are listed as threatened or endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. In South America Puma hunting is prohibited in Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , French Guiana , Guatemala , Honduras , Nicaragua , Panama , Paraguay , Surinam , Venezuela , and Uruguay ; it is unprotected in Ecuador , El Salvador , and Guyana . The Puma can be hunted in Mexico and Peru . Small population size has resulted in reduced genetic variability and maladaptive physiological traits such as atrial septal defects in coryi. However,there is no evidence that such phenotypic characters have negatively affected demographics in the population. Efforts to save the Florida Puma include experimental translocations and genetic introgression via the transport of female Puma from Texas. The Puma , like other large carnivores, is an effective conservation flagship because it requires large areas, exhibits top-down regulation, and can be popular with the public. A landscape approach to the conservation of this species will be important in maintaining both large and small populations because the species occurs at inherently low densities. Successful management and recovery strategies for Puma will require local and regional planning to balance expanding human populations and infrastructure development with habitat restoration. Land management policies that enhance prey populations and offer the Puma interconnected reserve systems are needed. Efforts to create blueprints for such large-scale conservation include Paseo Pantera (Wildlife Conservation Society) in Central and South America and the Florida Ecological Network. Bibliography.

Atfirst look, the Kinkajou appears more like a monkey than a carnivore, and indeed, it was first described as a lemur. Kinkajous are honey-colored animals with large forward facing eyes, small forward facing ears, and muscular prehensile tails. They have uniform dark colored flanks that blend to lightercolored buffy underparts. Although 2-3 times larger than olingos, the two species can be confused as they run through treetops at night. The olingo shows a much sharper transition from dark dorsal fur to light ventral fur, and its non-prehensile tail is fluffy, not muscular like that of the Kinkajou. The Kinkajou’s fur is woolly, and, across its range, can be a variety of shades, including tawny olive, yellowish-tawny, clay colored, or wood brown. Many animals have a dark mid-dorsal stripe, and some animals in central Panama have a white-tipped tail. In seasonal forests the weight of individual Kinkajous fluctuates over the course of a year in synchrony with fruit availability.","Kinkajous are found in most tropical forest types that can produce fruit yearround. This includes rainforest, cloud forest, dry forest, and gallery forest. They have been found from sea level up to 2500 m . Kinkajous are strongly arboreal and rarely seen on the ground. They use all parts of the forest canopy.","Kinkajous are primarily frugivorous and nectivorous, although some consumption of insects has been recorded. Kinkajous select for larger, more productive fruiting trees. Fruit made up 90-99% ofthe diet of a population of Kinkajous in Panama , with the rest being nectar and leaves. Of the 78 species eaten from 29 families of plants, Moraceae was the most important, especially Ficus . Fruit and flowers were also the only food types observed from studies in French Guiana and Venezuela , making the Kinkajou one of the most frugivorous mammals. However, one report from Bolivia noted substantial amounts of ants from nine different species in the stomachs of six Kinkajous. All Kinkajou feeding is arboreal. An animal will sometimes hang by its prehensile tail and use both of its forepaws to handle fruit. Activity patterns. Kinkajous are among the most nocturnal animals. They typically emerge from their dens about 15 minutes after sunset and retire 15-30 minutes before sunrise. All activity is arboreal, and travelling between trees occupies 50-65% oftheir time, with the rest of their activity split between eating and resting. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Kinkajous have a flexible social structure, with individuals typically moving between trees alone, but socializing in groups at large feeding trees and day dens. Home range size varies from 10-50 ha, with males using slightly larger areas than females. Nightly travel distance averages about 2 km . Density of Kinkajous probably relates to the fruit production oflocal forests, and estimates from different forests range from 12-74 animals/km?*. Most Kinkajouslive in small, patrilineal groups consisting of two adult males, one adult female, a subadult, and a juvenile offspring. Additionally some females apparently live outside of stable groups and consort with males from neighboring social groups. Dispersal is femalebiased; young males appear to stay with their natal group, or disperse to a neighboring territory. Group members overlap regularly in home ranges, but separate each night for most foraging, thus reducing competition over food. During the course of the night group members meet up and socialize at large fruiting trees, where feeding competition is not important, with larger feeding groups, on average, in larger fruiting trees. Group members also socialize around day dens, where some group members sleep together at least 55% of the time. Kinkajous prefer to den in tree holes but have also been recorded making nests in palm trees. In Panama one Kinkajou group was observed using 44 different dens over the course of a year, preferentially sleeping in a few near the center of their range. Social behavior typically includes grooming bouts focused on the ears and head, where an animal can not groom itself. Grooming interactions are most frequent between adult and subadult males, and females and juveniles. In addition, males have been observed playing with juveniles from their group, including chases through the canopy and play-boxing while hanging by theirtails. Aggressive behavioris less common within social groups, but short fights between males have been observed. Neighboring social groups appear to strictly observe territorial boundaries. Aggression between neighboring females has been recorded, involving tree-top chases, with the subordinate animal eventually jumping to the forest floor to flee. Kinkajous communicate through vocalizations and specialized scent glands. Shortrange social interaction calls include brief hisses and screams. The long-range call is a two part “snort-weedle” consisting of one quick snort sound followed by a variable number of weedle vocalizations. This call is sometimes repeated for as long as 15 minutes. The snort-weedle sometimes appears to call-in other social group members, but may have other functions as well. Kinkajous also communicate through scent marks, which are made by three unique glands, one on their abdomen, one on their throat, and a pair of mandibular glands. These glands produce a subtle smell that is slightly fruity and musky. Given the three different types of scent glands, different marks probably have different purposes, which have been hypothesized to include territorial markers, trail markers, and sexual signals. Adult Kinkajous do not face high predation risk because they are generally too nocturnal for eagles, too large for owls, and too arboreal for large cats. Nonetheless, individuals occasionally venture too close to the ground, or are active in daylight, making themselves vulnerable to predation, and have been recorded in the diet ofJaguars, Ocelots and eagles.",,"Kinkajous are among the most nocturnal animals.

Nonetheless, individuals occasionally venture too close to the ground, or are active in daylight, making themselves vulnerable to predation, and have been recorded in the diet ofJaguars, Ocelots and eagles. Breeding. Kinkajous do not have an obvious breeding season, although this may be masked by the variation in the timing of fruiting seasons across their large range. Kinkajous are polyestrous, with gestation times of 100-120 days, and typically give birth to one pup, although litters of two have been recorded. Pups are dependent on their mothers for an extensive period of time. They do not take solid food until eight weeks and are not fully mobile in the tree branches until they are three months old. Males have not been observed contributing to the care of offspring, and mothers apparently “park” the young pups alone in the trees while they forage. Male Kinkajous reach maturity at 1-5 years and females at 2-25 years. In captivity one Kinkajou lived for 40-5 years, although 20 years is more common.","Kinkajousare classified by The IUCN Red List as Least Concern. They are common over much oftheir range and are considered moderately sensitive to habitat fragmentation. They are occasionally hunted for meat but are not a preferred food item, and there is no market for their fur. Some animals are sold into the pet trade.","Bisbal (1986) | Daily et al.

In addition, males have been observed playing with juveniles from their group, including chases through the canopy and play-boxing while hanging by theirtails. Aggressive behavioris less common within social groups, but short fights between males have been observed. Neighboring social groups appear to strictly observe territorial boundaries. Aggression between neighboring females has been recorded, involving tree-top chases, with the subordinate animal eventually jumping to the forest floor to flee. Kinkajous communicate through vocalizations and specialized scent glands. Shortrange social interaction calls include brief hisses and screams. The long-range call is a two part “snort-weedle” consisting of one quick snort sound followed by a variable number of weedle vocalizations. This call is sometimes repeated for as long as 15 minutes. The snort-weedle sometimes appears to call-in other social group members, but may have other functions as well. Kinkajous also communicate through scent marks, which are made by three unique glands, one on their abdomen, one on their throat, and a pair of mandibular glands. These glands produce a subtle smell that is slightly fruity and musky. Given the three different types of scent glands, different marks probably have different purposes, which have been hypothesized to include territorial markers, trail markers, and sexual signals. Adult Kinkajous do not face high predation risk because they are generally too nocturnal for eagles, too large for owls, and too arboreal for large cats. Nonetheless, individuals occasionally venture too close to the ground, or are active in daylight, making themselves vulnerable to predation, and have been recorded in the diet ofJaguars, Ocelots and eagles. Breeding. Kinkajous do not have an obvious breeding season, although this may be masked by the variation in the timing of fruiting seasons across their large range. Kinkajous are polyestrous, with gestation times of 100-120 days, and typically give birth to one pup, although litters of two have been recorded. Pups are dependent on their mothers for an extensive period of time. They do not take solid food until eight weeks and are not fully mobile in the tree branches until they are three months old. Males have not been observed contributing to the care of offspring, and mothers apparently “park” the young pups alone in the trees while they forage. Male Kinkajous reach maturity at 1-5 years and females at 2-25 years. In captivity one Kinkajou lived for 40-5 years, although 20 years is more common. Status and Conservation. Kinkajousare classified by The IUCN Red List as Least Concern. They are common over much oftheir range and are considered moderately sensitive to habitat fragmentation. They are occasionally hunted for meat but are not a preferred food item, and there is no market for their fur. Some animals are sold into the pet trade. Bibliography. Bisbal (1986), Daily et al.

Coatis are unique in the animal world, with their long pointed snouts and upright, ringed tails. The White-nosed Coati is distinguished from the South American Coati by its white muzzle and in having hair on the neck in a normal posterior position. Pelage coloration is quite variable, ranging from pale to reddish to almost black, often overlaid with some yellow or silver. The rings in the tail may be strongly or weakly evident.","White-nosed Coatis occupy a variety of wooded habitats, especially tropical rainforests, ranging up to 2879 m . In the north they concentrate in riparian pinyonoak-juniper habitats, but occasionally range into deserts and savannas.","White-nosed Coatis are omnivorous, eating primarily invertebrates and fruit but also consuming vertebrates and carrion when available. In Panama , 44% of coati foraging was on leaf-litter invertebrates, 56% on fruit, and less than 1% on vertebrates. As they walk along searching for food they use their long snouts to constantly sniff in the leaf litter. Prey is dug up or extracted from debris. Animals with harmful bites or stings are often killed by rolling them between the paws, which also removes hairs or spiny projections. Coatis eat fallen fruit under trees, but also climb to pick fresh fruit. Although they are adept climbers, most (over 90%) of their foraging is done on the ground. At least one species of bird, an understory hawk,is thought to associate with bands of White-nosed Coatis to hunt prey fleeing foraging coatis. Whitenosed Coatis have been observed grooming themselves with the resin of Trattinnickia aspera, presumably for some pharmaceutical value. Activity patterns. White-nosed Coatis are primarily diurnal, spending the night hiding in trees or rocky ledges. They spend about 90% of their waking hours foraging, although they may take rests of up to two hours in the high-fruit season. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The amount of space used by coatis is flexible across their range, with population averages varying from 0-33 to 13-5 km? in different habitats. The high end of this variation is in Arizona, where home range size averaged 13-5 km?* for bands, 6-1 km? for solitary males, and did not fluctuate greatly between seasons or years. In Mexican dry forest home range size averaged 3-8 km? and was not different between males and bands in total area. Bands used roughly half as much area in the wet season, although males did not change ranging behavior seasonally. Additionally, range size varied greatly (from 45 and 362 ha) within the dry forest in ways that were notrelated to food abundance, butto the dispersion of water sources during the dry season. In Panamanian rainforest, home range size averaged about 0-33 km*® for both males and females. Coatis are among the most gregarious of the Carnivora . White-nosed Coati groups have been reported as large as 30, although 5-18 animals are more typical. These matrilineal groups, known as bands, are composed primarily of related females and their offspring. Some non-relatives may also be in the band, although they receive more aggression, and less coalition support, from other band members. The size of groups fluctuates over time due to mortality, newly born juveniles, and emigrating subadult males. Large groups often split into subgroups that separate for several hours or days, and sometimes fission permanently into two groups. Fusion of previously separate groups has also been noted, although groups are typically slightly antagonistic to neighboring groups. Most males are solitary, and are usually chased awayif they approach female groups. However, some males are tolerated, and groups may have a few adult males associating with them. These are typically older offspring remaining in their natal home range and they do notsire offspring with the group. They may associate with groupsto take advantage of grooming or for the safety in numbers. Group members show a variety of cooperative behaviors including shared parental care, grooming, shared vigilance, and cooperative attacks on potential predators. Food is not shared between adults, although juveniles are tolerated by feeding animals. Group members do not cooperate to hunt invertebrates and females are actually more efficient when hunting away from the group. However, grouping may help the smaller females gain access to fruiting trees, as groups cooperate to chase away larger males that would otherwise be dominant in one-on-one interactions. Reducing predation risk seems to be a universal benefit of grouping in coatis. For example, in dry forests larger coati groups can drink more at water holes, a focal point for predators. Predation rates can be high, causing more than 50% of deaths in some populations in Mexico and Arizona. Predation rates are highest on solitary coatis and nexthighest on small groups, with larger groups having the lowest predation rate. These lower rates result from a suite of anti-predator behaviors, including foraging with the Juveniles in the center of the group, sharing vigilance, and alarm calling, and mobbing and attacking predators. Given their diurnal and social tendencies,it is not surprising that White-nosed Coatis have a rich repertoire of specific vocalizations for aggression, appeasement, alarm, and sexual contact. The two most common calls are chirps and squawks. Squawks are longer-duration, low-maximum frequency, wide-bandwidth calls with six resonances and little frequency modulation. Chirps are tonal calls of shorter duration, with frequency modulations. Chirps are high frequency, extending above the human hearing range into ultrasonic frequencies (30-55 kHz). They seem to function as contact calls, being emitted only while bands of coatis are moving. The short duration and high frequency of the calls may allow for contact with nearby group members while minimizing auditory detection by predators. Unique features of each coati’s chirp also may allow individual recognition. Like most Carnivora , coatis are also known to scent-mark. Males mark with a perineal gland throughout the year, while females primarily mark only before the mating season.",,"White-nosed Coatis are primarily diurnal, spending the night hiding in trees or rocky ledges.

Males mark with a perineal gland throughout the year, while females primarily mark only before the mating season. Breeding. Breeding is highly seasonal in White-nosed Coatis, typically within a 2-4 week period. This occursin late January in Panama . Mating has been observed in the trees and on the ground. The mating system for coatis in Tikal National Park, Guatemala has been described as a mobile lek, with aggregations of males following female bands and climbing into the trees above them to display. Male vocalizations were similar to the alarm calls given by coatis in bands, but they were repeated steadily for many minutes at a time, not given in several-second bursts as in alarm situations. Females then selected one of these males to mate, by climbing up into the tree where he was displaying. This unique behavior has not been described for other coati populations, so it is unclear how widespread it is. Females can first breed at 22 months, but often wait another year or two depending on ecological conditions. Males can first mate at 34 months, but because of competition for matings, may not be successful until they are four or five years old; some males are probably never able to breed. Females leave their bandsto give birth in a tree after a 70-77 day gestation period. Young coatis begin to walk at eleven days and are able to rejoin the band with their mothers by 40 days. Litter size is 1-6, although some die before rejoining the band. Most females rejoin the band with an average of 3-5 juveniles. Females nurse for up to four months, and will nurse and care for offspring from other band members. Young males leave the band and becomesolitary after about two years. Animals in captivity have lived to 17 years, and to at least nine in the wild.","Most White-nosed Coatis are classified as a species of Least Concern by The IUCN Red List as they are widespread and often common in a variety of habitats.

Northern Raccoons have relatively short ringed tails and striking black masks. Their body fur is grizzled gray, and often long. There may be some reddish color on the nape of the neck. Animals in arid areas are lighter in color, whereas those in humid forests are darker. The largest raccoons are in the north-west USA and the smallest are in the south-east.","Raccoons use a variety of habitat types, preferring waterways such as streams, rivers, lake shores, and wetlands. The have adapted well to urban habitats.","Northern Raccoons are among the most omnivorous mammals on Earth. They will take advantage of any locally abundant food source they can get their hands on, including fruits, nuts, grains, invertebrates, fish, and small terrestrial vertebrates. A variety of plant products make up a majority of their diet in all seasons. In urban areas raccoons are famous for ingenious ways of procuring garbage, and in rural areas, for raiding crops. In natural settings raccoons are typically tied to aquatic habitats, and aquatic invertebrates such as crabs and crayfish often make up a substantial portion of their diet. They occasionally catch frogs, lizards, snakes, and other terrestrial vertebrates, although these are rare in their diet compared with invertebrate prey. Raccoons are reported to be able to detect a single acorn buried under 5 cm of sand, and much of their animal food comes not after dramatic chases but from using their keen sense of smell to locate nests and predate eggs or nestlings. This can be a problem for the egg-layers in areas where raccoon density is elevated because of human subsidization. Nest predation has been implicated in reducing the population size of turtles, green iguanas, and some low-nesting bird species. The Raccoon’s keen nose also makes it a good scavenger, able to detect fresh carcasses. Competition with other omnivores is not obvious. Opossums did not change population parameters, diet, or habitat use in an area where raccoons had been removed. Food passes through the raccoon digestive system in 9-14 hours, long enough to make it probable that they function as important seed dispersers for the fruit plants they feed on. Northern Raccoons received their species name, lotor , meaning “the washer”, because they are thought to wash their food before eating it. They are fond of dunking their food, although there is no indication this has any washing function, since they submerge both clean and dirty foods. One alternative hypothesis is that getting their hands wet increases the pliability of the skin on their fingers, thus increasing theirtactile sensitivity. Indeed, raccoons use their dexterous hands to procure much of their food, prying under rock on stream bottoms or into garbage cans. Activity patterns. Raccoons are primarily nocturnal, with activity peaking slightly before midnight. However, they will venture out in daylight to take advantage of food sources, for example, to forage at low tide. In cold areas raccoons may enter a dormant period during winter, spending weeks or months in a den. This is not hibernation, as their heart rate and body temperature do not decrease. Instead, they burn through stored body fat to maintain themselves over this period, sometimes losing more than 50% of their mass during winter. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Raccoon populations have increased and spread substantially over the past century. Their numbers were at an alltime low in the 1920s and 1930s following severe persecution for the fur trade. Game management regulations allowed them to begin their recovery in the 1940s, and by the 1980s their populations were estimated to be twenty times larger than in the 1930s. Their range expanded, too, and they are now found in nearly all of the lower 48 states, including deserts and mountain regions where they had previously been rare or absent. The spread of agriculture and concurrent decline of the Gray Wolf and Puma were probably both important factors in the increase and spread of the raccoon. The raccoon is one of the most successful native species at adapting to urban and rural environments, but raccoons also occur in wilderness. Densities in natural areas have been estimated as 0-5—4 ind/km? in northern prairies and 3-5-6 ind/km* in hardwood forests. Their populations increase where they can find anthropogenic food sources. These subsidized densities range from 1-27 ind/km? for rural areas and 50-100 ind/ km? in cities. Some estimates from urban parks are as high as 333 ind/km?, although these calculations do not take into account the area used by raccoons outside of the park. In Chicago, densities were typically one third higher in the autumn than in the spring, reflecting the litters born in the summer and mortalities that occurred during the winter. The higher densities in urban areas are caused by a combination of demographic factors, including increased survival, higher annual recruitment, and increased site fidelity. These factors are all encouraged by the raccoon’s ability to learn how to take advantage of abundant anthropogenic food, and apparently also by high levels of intraspecific tolerance. Most individuals in a population are under two years old, and few reach as old as seven years. Some trapping studies found a male-biased sex ratio, but subsequent research suggests that this result may have occurred because the males were more trappable, and females actually outnumber males in most populations. Corresponding with their higher densities, urban raccoons typically use smaller home ranges than rural animals: 5-79 ha compared to 50-300 ha, often focusing their activities around a few select sources of anthropogenic food. Wilderness animals use even larger home ranges, averaging between 800-2500 ha in North Dakota , where individuals were recorded travelling as far as 14 km in one night. Typical nocturnal movements cover less ground and consist of a few periods of rapid movement between den and feeding sites, followed by more lengthy periods of small, localized movements at foraging sites. Patterns of home range overlap and social organization in raccoons vary predictably with density and available resources. Female raccoons appear to space themselves out according to the available food, and sometimes water, resources. Where food is rare or scattered females are more solitary. Where food is more abundant, and many individuals are able to share space without competing for food, related females may overlap more in home range and occasionally interact during nocturnal foraging or in diurnal resting dens. Males adopt strategies that allow them to maximize their individual fitness, given this distribution of females. In low densities, males will set up territories and defend them against other males, attempting to gain exclusive access to the female (s) they spatially overlap. In areas with medium densities of females, males cannot defend a territory alone, and they share space with other males. One study found that 3-4 of these overlapping males formed stable bonds that lasted for several years. These male groups frequently travelled and denned together, overlapping many different females, but no other males. The raccoon mating system appears to vary across these situations, between polygyny in low density areas and promiscuity in higher density areas. In the polygynous systems males compete for access to estrous females within a predictable dominance hierarchy related to body weight and canine width. In promiscuous systems females mate with multiple males, and most litters (88% in one study) have multiple paternities. The primary predators of adult raccoons were probably Gray Wolves and Pumas. The extinction of these large predators from many areas, especially in urban or rural areas, probably freed raccoons from substantial predation risk throughout much oftheir range. Raccoons and Coyotes are sympatric over much of their ranges, but the nature of interactions appears to be variable. In Kansas , 40% of raccoon mortalities came from Coyote predation, and raccoons make up a substantial portion of the diet of Coyotes in some parts of Ohio and Maine (some of this may be scavenging on roadkill). However, most studies of Coyote diet find little evidence of raccoon predation, and other studies of raccoon mortality have found no Coyote predation. One detailed study of raccoon and Coyote movements in Illinois found no avoidance by raccoons ofareas preferred by Coyotes, or of their scent marks. In some areas, humans have replaced other predators as the major cause of death, either through directed hunting, or accidental deaths such as road kills. Disease has also been found to be important in a number of raccoon populations. Diseases spread more easily between individuals living at high density,so it is not surprising that disease can spread rapidly in urban raccoon populations. Raccoon rabies has been one of the most dramatic examples of wildlife disease in North America. From the 1950s to 1970s a strain of raccoon rabies spread slowly northward out of Florida into Georgia . In 1980, an illegal translocation of 3500 raccoons from Florida to Virginia for hunting purposes set off an epidemic. Apparently at least one of these animals was harboring the rabies virus, and an outbreak spread at a rate of 40km /year up the Atlantic coast, north into Ontario and west into Ohio and Pennsylvania . This epidemic has caused high mortality in urban raccoons, noticeably reducing their populations in some areas, and also spilled over to impact other wildlife, pets, and humans. Another species that suffers from parasite spillover from superabundant raccoons has been the Allegheny Woodrat (Neotoma magister). Woodrats suffer high mortality from infections of raccoon roundworm parasites, which have little effect on the raccoons themselves. Woodrats pick up the parasites while feeding on seeds from raccoon latrines. Raccoons do not habitually sing or call out, but do have a variety of vocalizations that occur during close-range social interactions, including a twittering used by females to encourage their young to follow them away from the den. Scent marking is probably the most important means of communication. Raccoons have paired anal scent glands for this purpose, but also use feces, urine, and other specialized skin glands. In some areas raccoons defecate in habitual latrines, although it is unclear if these serve a social function or are just a by-product of high raccoon density.",,"Raccoons are primarily nocturnal, with activity peaking slightly before midnight.

In some areas raccoons defecate in habitual latrines, although it is unclear if these serve a social function or are just a by-product of high raccoon density. Breeding. Northern Raccoons are spontaneous ovulators. Mating typically occurs in February and March, although being consummate opportunists, litters can also be conceived outside of this period. In Texas many females with litters that failed in the spring came into a second estrus later in the year, resulting in a second, but smaller, breeding pulse in the population. Mating appears to be the only time males and females associate. Males consort with females over a period of 1-3 days, with females serially visiting and copulating with more than one male during this time. Gestation averages 63 days (range 54-70) and mostlitters have 3—4 cubs,typically from multiple fathers. Newborns eat solid food at nine weeks but nursing continues until 16 weeks. Cubsfirst leave the nest at 6-7 weeks and often spend much of their first autumn travelling alone. Many juveniles return to mom for winter denning, ultimately dispersing when she comes into estrus the following spring. Males disperse to new areas, covering distances averaging 11 km , although distances up to 275 km have been reported. Females often stick close to home, overlapping in some or all of their home ranges, and sometimes reuniting in winter to form extensive communal dens.","Raccoons are considered Least Concern by The [UCN Red List since they are among the most abundant medium-sized mammals in their range. Because of their abundance they have been one of the most economically important furbearers in North America, with fur harvests in 1930s and 1940s ranging between 0-4-2 million skins annually and reaching an all-time high of 5-1 million in 1979/80. However, because of their high reproductive potential and ability to exploit human settlements they saw no obvious broad scale population reductions from this harvest. The fur trade has declined in the last two decades and raccoons are now widely viewed as urban pests, potentially dangerous because of rabies.

Ursus lotor Linnaeus, 1758 , Pennsylvania , USA . Historically, more than 50 types of Northern Raccoons have been named. However, more recent work has shown this species to have a high degree of morphological plasticity in the face of environmental variation. Caribbean forms were recently shown to be recent introductions from the east USA and are no longer considered unique species. The taxonomy of inland forms has not yet been revised with modern methods, so the twenty recognized subspecies remain poorly defined. Subspecies and Distribution. P.l. lotor Linnaeus, 1758 — NE USA .

Head-body 44-62 cm, tail 19-36 cm; weight 2:7-10. 4 kg . Northern Raccoons have relatively short ringed tails and striking black masks. Their body fur is grizzled gray, and often long. There may be some reddish color on the nape of the neck. Animals in arid areas are lighter in color, whereas those in humid forests are darker. The largest raccoons are in the north-west USA and the smallest are in the south-east. Habitat. Raccoons use a variety of habitat types, preferring waterways such as streams, rivers, lake shores, and wetlands. The have adapted well to urban habitats. Food and Feeding. Northern Raccoons are among the most omnivorous mammals on Earth. They will take advantage of any locally abundant food source they can get their hands on, including fruits, nuts, grains, invertebrates, fish, and small terrestrial vertebrates. A variety of plant products make up a majority of their diet in all seasons. In urban areas raccoons are famous for ingenious ways of procuring garbage, and in rural areas, for raiding crops. In natural settings raccoons are typically tied to aquatic habitats, and aquatic invertebrates such as crabs and crayfish often make up a substantial portion of their diet. They occasionally catch frogs, lizards, snakes, and other terrestrial vertebrates, although these are rare in their diet compared with invertebrate prey. Raccoons are reported to be able to detect a single acorn buried under 5 cm of sand, and much of their animal food comes not after dramatic chases but from using their keen sense of smell to locate nests and predate eggs or nestlings. This can be a problem for the egg-layers in areas where raccoon density is elevated because of human subsidization. Nest predation has been implicated in reducing the population size of turtles, green iguanas, and some low-nesting bird species. The Raccoon’s keen nose also makes it a good scavenger, able to detect fresh carcasses. Competition with other omnivores is not obvious. Opossums did not change population parameters, diet, or habitat use in an area where raccoons had been removed. Food passes through the raccoon digestive system in 9-14 hours, long enough to make it probable that they function as important seed dispersers for the fruit plants they feed on. Northern Raccoons received their species name, lotor , meaning “the washer”, because they are thought to wash their food before eating it. They are fond of dunking their food, although there is no indication this has any washing function, since they submerge both clean and dirty foods. One alternative hypothesis is that getting their hands wet increases the pliability of the skin on their fingers, thus increasing theirtactile sensitivity. Indeed, raccoons use their dexterous hands to procure much of their food, prying under rock on stream bottoms or into garbage cans. Activity patterns. Raccoons are primarily nocturnal, with activity peaking slightly before midnight. However, they will venture out in daylight to take advantage of food sources, for example, to forage at low tide. In cold areas raccoons may enter a dormant period during winter, spending weeks or months in a den. This is not hibernation, as their heart rate and body temperature do not decrease. Instead, they burn through stored body fat to maintain themselves over this period, sometimes losing more than 50% of their mass during winter. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Raccoon populations have increased and spread substantially over the past century. Their numbers were at an alltime low in the 1920s and 1930s following severe persecution for the fur trade. Game management regulations allowed them to begin their recovery in the 1940s, and by the 1980s their populations were estimated to be twenty times larger than in the 1930s. Their range expanded, too, and they are now found in nearly all of the lower 48 states, including deserts and mountain regions where they had previously been rare or absent. The spread of agriculture and concurrent decline of the Gray Wolf and Puma were probably both important factors in the increase and spread of the raccoon. The raccoon is one of the most successful native species at adapting to urban and rural environments, but raccoons also occur in wilderness. Densities in natural areas have been estimated as 0-5—4 ind/km? in northern prairies and 3-5-6 ind/km* in hardwood forests. Their populations increase where they can find anthropogenic food sources. These subsidized densities range from 1-27 ind/km? for rural areas and 50-100 ind/ km? in cities. Some estimates from urban parks are as high as 333 ind/km?, although these calculations do not take into account the area used by raccoons outside of the park. In Chicago, densities were typically one third higher in the autumn than in the spring, reflecting the litters born in the summer and mortalities that occurred during the winter. The higher densities in urban areas are caused by a combination of demographic factors, including increased survival, higher annual recruitment, and increased site fidelity. These factors are all encouraged by the raccoon’s ability to learn how to take advantage of abundant anthropogenic food, and apparently also by high levels of intraspecific tolerance. Most individuals in a population are under two years old, and few reach as old as seven years. Some trapping studies found a male-biased sex ratio, but subsequent research suggests that this result may have occurred because the males were more trappable, and females actually outnumber males in most populations. Corresponding with their higher densities, urban raccoons typically use smaller home ranges than rural animals: 5-79 ha compared to 50-300 ha, often focusing their activities around a few select sources of anthropogenic food. Wilderness animals use even larger home ranges, averaging between 800-2500 ha in North Dakota , where individuals were recorded travelling as far as 14 km in one night. Typical nocturnal movements cover less ground and consist of a few periods of rapid movement between den and feeding sites, followed by more lengthy periods of small, localized movements at foraging sites. Patterns of home range overlap and social organization in raccoons vary predictably with density and available resources. Female raccoons appear to space themselves out according to the available food, and sometimes water, resources. Where food is rare or scattered females are more solitary. Where food is more abundant, and many individuals are able to share space without competing for food, related females may overlap more in home range and occasionally interact during nocturnal foraging or in diurnal resting dens. Males adopt strategies that allow them to maximize their individual fitness, given this distribution of females. In low densities, males will set up territories and defend them against other males, attempting to gain exclusive access to the female (s) they spatially overlap. In areas with medium densities of females, males cannot defend a territory alone, and they share space with other males. One study found that 3-4 of these overlapping males formed stable bonds that lasted for several years. These male groups frequently travelled and denned together, overlapping many different females, but no other males. The raccoon mating system appears to vary across these situations, between polygyny in low density areas and promiscuity in higher density areas. In the polygynous systems males compete for access to estrous females within a predictable dominance hierarchy related to body weight and canine width. In promiscuous systems females mate with multiple males, and most litters (88% in one study) have multiple paternities. The primary predators of adult raccoons were probably Gray Wolves and Pumas. The extinction of these large predators from many areas, especially in urban or rural areas, probably freed raccoons from substantial predation risk throughout much oftheir range. Raccoons and Coyotes are sympatric over much of their ranges, but the nature of interactions appears to be variable. In Kansas , 40% of raccoon mortalities came from Coyote predation, and raccoons make up a substantial portion of the diet of Coyotes in some parts of Ohio and Maine (some of this may be scavenging on roadkill). However, most studies of Coyote diet find little evidence of raccoon predation, and other studies of raccoon mortality have found no Coyote predation. One detailed study of raccoon and Coyote movements in Illinois found no avoidance by raccoons ofareas preferred by Coyotes, or of their scent marks. In some areas, humans have replaced other predators as the major cause of death, either through directed hunting, or accidental deaths such as road kills. Disease has also been found to be important in a number of raccoon populations. Diseases spread more easily between individuals living at high density,so it is not surprising that disease can spread rapidly in urban raccoon populations. Raccoon rabies has been one of the most dramatic examples of wildlife disease in North America. From the 1950s to 1970s a strain of raccoon rabies spread slowly northward out of Florida into Georgia . In 1980, an illegal translocation of 3500 raccoons from Florida to Virginia for hunting purposes set off an epidemic. Apparently at least one of these animals was harboring the rabies virus, and an outbreak spread at a rate of 40km /year up the Atlantic coast, north into Ontario and west into Ohio and Pennsylvania . This epidemic has caused high mortality in urban raccoons, noticeably reducing their populations in some areas, and also spilled over to impact other wildlife, pets, and humans. Another species that suffers from parasite spillover from superabundant raccoons has been the Allegheny Woodrat (Neotoma magister). Woodrats suffer high mortality from infections of raccoon roundworm parasites, which have little effect on the raccoons themselves. Woodrats pick up the parasites while feeding on seeds from raccoon latrines. Raccoons do not habitually sing or call out, but do have a variety of vocalizations that occur during close-range social interactions, including a twittering used by females to encourage their young to follow them away from the den. Scent marking is probably the most important means of communication. Raccoons have paired anal scent glands for this purpose, but also use feces, urine, and other specialized skin glands. In some areas raccoons defecate in habitual latrines, although it is unclear if these serve a social function or are just a by-product of high raccoon density. Breeding. Northern Raccoons are spontaneous ovulators. Mating typically occurs in February and March, although being consummate opportunists, litters can also be conceived outside of this period. In Texas many females with litters that failed in the spring came into a second estrus later in the year, resulting in a second, but smaller, breeding pulse in the population. Mating appears to be the only time males and females associate. Males consort with females over a period of 1-3 days, with females serially visiting and copulating with more than one male during this time. Gestation averages 63 days (range 54-70) and mostlitters have 3—4 cubs,typically from multiple fathers. Newborns eat solid food at nine weeks but nursing continues until 16 weeks. Cubsfirst leave the nest at 6-7 weeks and often spend much of their first autumn travelling alone. Many juveniles return to mom for winter denning, ultimately dispersing when she comes into estrus the following spring. Males disperse to new areas, covering distances averaging 11 km , although distances up to 275 km have been reported. Females often stick close to home, overlapping in some or all of their home ranges, and sometimes reuniting in winter to form extensive communal dens. Status and Conservation. Raccoons are considered Least Concern by The [UCN Red List since they are among the most abundant medium-sized mammals in their range. Because of their abundance they have been one of the most economically important furbearers in North America, with fur harvests in 1930s and 1940s ranging between 0-4-2 million skins annually and reaching an all-time high of 5-1 million in 1979/80. However, because of their high reproductive potential and ability to exploit human settlements they saw no obvious broad scale population reductions from this harvest. The fur trade has declined in the last two decades and raccoons are now widely viewed as urban pests, potentially dangerous because of rabies. Their subsidized populations near human settlements may cause conservation problems for other species due to disease spillover or nest predation. Through breeding for the fur trade they have become established as an invasive species in Europe, Russia , and Japan . They are also an introduced species on some Caribbean islands, where they endanger native island fauna not adapted to dealing with a mammalian predator with a keen sense of smell. Bibliography.

N. n. vittata Tschudi, 1844 — Venezuela , the Guianas. Descriptive notes. Head-body 43-58 cm, tail 42-55 cm; weight 2.7-2 kg. Males larger than females. Coatis are unique in the animal world, with their long pointed snouts and ringed tails, which are typically held vertically. The South American Coatiis distinguished from the White-nosed Coati by having a brown or gray (not white) muzzle and in having hair on the neck in a reversed, anterior position. The South American Coati is also much larger than the Mountain Coati. The pelage coloration of South American Coats is variable across their range, and even within a litter. They are always brownish, but range from orangish or reddish to very dark brown, often with yellow highlights. The rings in the tail may be strongly or weakly evident. Habitat. Found in a variety of forested habitats including rainforest, riverine gallery forest, cloud forest, and xeric Chaco , cerrado, and dry scrub forests up to 2500 m elevation. Food and Feeding. Omnivorous feeders, South American Coatis eat a wide variety of invertebrates and fruit including larval beetles, scorpions, spiders, centipedes, and coleopterans. Rodents, fish, crabs, and carrion have also been reported. The most detailed study of South American Coati diet comes from south-eastern Brazil , where 226 fecal samples included plant parts (854%), insects (75:7%), millipedes (53-9%), 49 species of fruits (48:7%), spiders (33-6%), organic waste (9-7%), vertebrates (9-3%), and gastropods (2:6%).

Head-body 35-49 cm, tail 40-53 cm; weight 1.1-6 kg. This is the largest olingo, differing from others in the genus by being more yellowish brown and often having a prominently ringed tail. It is also more sexually dimorphic than other olingos, with males having more robust heads. Habitat. Found in forests within the central part of Mesoamerica. This olingo has a wide elevational range (near sea level to about 2000 m ) but is most common in mountainous forests above 1000 m . This is probably the species recently recorded in the lowlands of Guatemala , and perhaps also seen in the mountains of Honduras . Food and Feeding. Northern Olingos have been seen feeding on fruit and nectar in rainforest trees, but no details have been published on their diet. Anecdotal evidence suggests they may also catch small animal prey in the trees. Activity patterns. Northern Olingos are arboreal and typically nocturnal. Olingos in Monteverde, Costa Rica , have been recorded active during the day;it is unclearif this is typical for the species orif this is in response to being fed by humans at the tourist lodge. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Northern Olingos are typically seen as singletons, but other details of their behavior have not been studied. Breeding. The breeding behavior of the Northern Olingo has not been described but is presumed to be similar to the Lowland olingo. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern by The IUCN Red List, but probably more sensitive to disturbance than other procyonids. In eastern Costa Ricait is considered highly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and was recorded from the Las Cruces Forest reserve, and from some forest remnants, but not from open habitats. The recent change in the taxonomy of this group, and limited geographic range of this species, will probably require a revision ofits conservation status. Bibliography. Daily et al.

Ringtails are slimmer than cats but more robust than weasels, with incredibly long, bushy, black and white tails. This combination is unmistakable, and Ringtails are only likely to be confused with their congeners, Cacomistles. The two species are sympatric in part of their range, but can be distinguished by a number of characters. Ringtails are about one fourth smaller, with more contrasting facial and tail markings, and longer hindlimbs, which gives them a downward slanting profile from rump to nose. The body color of Ringtails is grayish above and white or buff below. Cacomistles are browner above and gray or tan below. The feet of the two species are also different, reflecting their different habitats, with Ringtails having short, straight, semi-retractile claws and digital foot pads surrounded by hair except behind the first digits. Finally, the Ringtail tail has black rings of uniform size, which are broken by white on the ventral surface, whereas the Cacomistle tail has unbroken black rings and the distal one third ofthe tail is nearly uniformly black. Within their range, the Ringtail coat color varies in predictable ways in being darker in forests, higher elevations, and higher latitudes and lighter in drier habitats, lower elevations and in the south of its range.","Ringtails use a variety of habitats characterized by rocky outcroppings, canyons, or talus slopes. These include montane conifer forests, riparian areas, dry tropical habitats, chaparral, and deserts, including small urban nature preserves. They are typically found from sea level to 1400 m but are occasionally reported to 2900 m .","Ringtails eat small animals and fruit. Their steady, gliding motion allows them to catch a variety of prey the size of hares and smaller including rodents, lizards, snakes, and birds. Ringtails pin prey to the ground with their forefeet and begin their meal by consuming the head. Their diet varies seasonally and regionally as they take advantage of opportunities including raiding bat caves, predating bird nests, and feeding on nectar from agave. Individual meals consumed by wild Ringtails have been estimated at 55-90 g; captive animals can be maintained on 25 g of cat food and raisins per day. Activity patterns. Ringtails are strongly nocturnal, with an aversion to daylight that begins soon after birth and persists through adulthood. Animals begin activity at or just after dusk and are back in their den sleeping before dawn, or within 45 minutes after daybreak. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In high quality habitat Ringtails can live in densities of up to 20 ind/km? and use home ranges as small as 5 ha. However, densities are typically an order of magnitude lower, for example, 2-2—4-2 ind/km? in woodland habitat, where home ranges averaged 43 ha for males and 20 ha for females. Ringtails do not appear to be creatures of habit. They change dens frequently, rarely using the same rock crevice, hollow tree, or underground burrow for more than three consecutive days. In some areas their home ranges may also be dynamic, changing with the seasons, to the extent that some individuals use completely different areas from month to month. Ringtails appear to have a typical carnivore social structure with little sociality and males attempting to overlap and mate with one or more females. Telemetry studies suggest a social structure based on land tenure, with no signs of monogamy. Wild animals typically den separately, but can be kept together in captivity. Given their asocial tendencies most Ringtail communication is based on scent marks left in conspicuous places to denote territorial boundaries or communicate with potential mates. These marks include urine rubbed on the ground and on raised objects, and latrine areas with accumulated feces. These marks increase conspicuously just before and during the mating season. When they do encounter another animal, Ringtails may use a variety of generic vocalizations including squeaks, chucking and barks, hisses, grunts, growls, and metallic chirps.",,"Ringtails are strongly nocturnal, with an aversion to daylight that begins soon after birth and persists through adulthood.

Ringtails are monestrous, and females show a vulva tumescence one to two weeks before copulation. Breeding can occur anytime between February and May, but is typically in March or April. The female will become receptive to a male for 24-36 hours. In this time the male chases the female and copulates several times per hour, in a sitting position. Ringtails have the shortest gestation of any procyonid, at 51-54 days, leading to birth of a litter of 1-4 young in May or June. Newborns are altricial, with fuzzy hair on their back and sealed eyelids that open after 3—4 weeks. Deciduous teeth appear at 3-4 weeks, with permanent dentition growing in by 17-20 weeks. They begin to eat solid food at 30-40 days and are weaned at about ten weeks. Cubs can walk well at six weeks and climb by eight weeks. Ringtails typically reach sexual maturity at two years, although mating has been reported after just one year. Captive animals live for 12-14 years, with one animal reaching 16-5 years.","Classified as Least Concern by The IUCN Red List. Ringtails are relatively common and widespread.

Head-body 30-37 cm, tail 31-44 cm; weight 0-87.1-1 kg. Ringtails are slimmer than cats but more robust than weasels, with incredibly long, bushy, black and white tails. This combination is unmistakable, and Ringtails are only likely to be confused with their congeners, Cacomistles. The two species are sympatric in part of their range, but can be distinguished by a number of characters. Ringtails are about one fourth smaller, with more contrasting facial and tail markings, and longer hindlimbs, which gives them a downward slanting profile from rump to nose. The body color of Ringtails is grayish above and white or buff below. Cacomistles are browner above and gray or tan below. The feet of the two species are also different, reflecting their different habitats, with Ringtails having short, straight, semi-retractile claws and digital foot pads surrounded by hair except behind the first digits. Finally, the Ringtail tail has black rings of uniform size, which are broken by white on the ventral surface, whereas the Cacomistle tail has unbroken black rings and the distal one third ofthe tail is nearly uniformly black. Within their range, the Ringtail coat color varies in predictable ways in being darker in forests, higher elevations, and higher latitudes and lighter in drier habitats, lower elevations and in the south of its range. Habitat. Ringtails use a variety of habitats characterized by rocky outcroppings, canyons, or talus slopes. These include montane conifer forests, riparian areas, dry tropical habitats, chaparral, and deserts, including small urban nature preserves. They are typically found from sea level to 1400 m but are occasionally reported to 2900 m . Food and Feeding. Ringtails eat small animals and fruit. Their steady, gliding motion allows them to catch a variety of prey the size of hares and smaller including rodents, lizards, snakes, and birds. Ringtails pin prey to the ground with their forefeet and begin their meal by consuming the head. Their diet varies seasonally and regionally as they take advantage of opportunities including raiding bat caves, predating bird nests, and feeding on nectar from agave.

The interpretation of the systematic position of C. ferox has varied over the years, because these animals possess characteristics seemingly diagnostic of the families Herpestidae , Viverridae , and Felidae . The ambiguities in understanding the evolution of this genus are now partially resolved. Apparently, all native Madagascar Carnivores represent a monophyletic endemic lineage derived from a single colonization of the island. They are now placed in the family Eupleridae . Cryptoprocta typicus is a synonym of C. ferox. A notably larger form of this genus, C. spelea, was identified from bone remains recovered from Holocene sites. At some of these sites remains of both C. spelea and C. ferox have been found, but due to a lack ofstratigraphic control it is unknown if they were temporally sympatric. The name C. antamba applied to some subfossil remains appears to be a teratological C. spelea. In different parts of Madagascar , people living in the countryside note the presence of two forms of Cryptoprocta —fosa mainty or “black Cryptoprocta’ and fosa mena or “reddish Cryptoprocta ”; the red form is said to be smaller. In the extreme south-west there are reports of a whitish morphotype. It remains unclear whether the differentiation of these formsis simply folklore or is associated with some general pattern of variation (age, sex, geographic) in extant C. ferox. Monotypic.",Madagascar .,"Head-body 70-80 cm, tail 65-70 cm, hindfoot 12-12. 8 cm ; weight 6.2-8. 6 kg (males) and 5.5-6. 8 kg (females). Sexually dimorphic, with males being larger. There have been previous reports of individuals weighing up to 20 kg ; either these measurements are incorrect or perhaps from unnaturally heavy captive animals. There is some indication of geographic variation in external measurements across the range of this species, but this needs further substantiation, as sample sizes are not extensive. This animal resembles a small Puma, with a sleek muscular body, long torso, and tail length nearly equivalent to head-body length. Fosa has a relatively short muzzle and short rounded ears. The pelage is fine and relatively dense, generally with uniform, pale, reddish-brown upperparts and dirty cream underparts. In some individuals, particularly males, the venter is colored orange from gland secretions.","Fosa is largely forest-dwelling. It is known from near sea level to 2600 m elevation. It occurs in all of the different natural forest types on Madagascar from the wettest (greater than 6000 mm of annual rainfall) to the driest zones (less than 400 mm ). This species appears to have higher population densities in the lowland western dry deciduous forests than in the lowland eastern rainforests. Densities decrease with increasing elevation in both sectors. Fosas are also found in the remaining forested islands in the central highlands. They are known on the Andringitra Massif from about 750 m (lower limit of the forest) to 2600 m (above forest line); this latter zone has extreme meteorological conditions with daily temperatures in August ranging from —-11°C to 30°C. Previous reports ofthis species on the off-shore island of Ile Sainte Marie are erroneous: the locality was Sainte Marie de Marovoay, not far from Mahajanga.","The Fosa’s large size, considerable strength, carnassial teeth, broad paw pads, highly flexible ankle joints, and semi-retractable claws make it a formidable carnivore, the top predator of Madagascar . In captivity these animals eat 800-1000 g of meat per day. Wild populations have a broad dietary regime, at least in part associated with local prey availability. There appears to be no differences between the sexes in dietary regime. Fosa has been reported to feed on mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, freshwater turtles, and insects. In recent years several analyses of scats have been conducted to determine the diet of this animal, across the different biomes it inhabits. The scats of Fosa are easy to recognize; they form thin 10-14 cm long and 1.5-2. 5 cm wide rolls, with at least one of the ends twisted. Most examples are gray in color; they often contain hair and mammalian bone fragments. At the majority ofsites, mammals are the most important prey. Both by number of individuals and biomass, lemurs are regular elements in the Fosa’s diet; the larger diurnal species of lemurs are at least in part taken from their arboreal sleeping sites. In the dry deciduous forests of Kirindy Centre de Formation Professionnelle Forestiere ( CFPF ), primates comprise over 80% of the biomass and nearly 60% based on relative frequency of the prey taken. In the dry deciduous forests of Ankarafantsika, larger lemur species (Eulemur spp. and Verreaux’s Sikafa Propithecus verreauxi) are overrepresented in the diet of Fosa as compared to their relative local densities, while notably smaller species (mouse lemurs Microcebus spp. and Lesser Dwarf Lemur Cheirogaleus medius) are underrepresented. At this site there are notable seasonal shifts in the types of lemurs taken by Fosa. Fosas also take a wide variety of non-primate prey and clearly have considerable dietary plasticity. They are known to feed on other Eupleridae ; Fosa was a serious problem in a study of the Spotted Fanaloka, where it followed trap lines and preyed on captured individuals. Bone remains of Narrow-striped Boky have been found in its scats. Fosa can be a voracious chicken predator. During the dry season in western deciduous forests there is a notable increase in the number of chicken remains in scats. Towards a 2000 m summit in the south-east, small tenrecs of the genera Microgale and Oryzorictes (Oryzorictinae), all with adult body mass ofless than 35 g , were found in Fosa scats. Above the tree line in the high mountain zone of Andringitra, birds, rodents, and shrew tenrecs (Microgale) are important components of this animal’s diet; to a lesser extent, their diet includes frogs and crabs. Further, at thissite the average prey body mass is only 40 g , including vertebrates weighing less than 10 g . This contrasts with an average prey body mass of 480 g in the humid forests of the north and 1140 g in the western dry deciduous forests. Some of the prey animals found in the Andringitra scats recovered above tree line were of forest-dwelling animals, indicating that these Fosas have notably large home ranges and do not rely completely on the prey base available above the forest. Fosas are known to take prey nearly their own weight, such as 6 kg lemurs of the genus Propithecus, but assertions that the Fosa is a lemur specialist, with these animals representing more than 50% of its diet, cannot be supported acrossits complete geographic range. Bone fragments of even larger animals, such as cows and bush pigs (Potamochoerus), have been found in Fosa scats and it is presumed that these are scavenged. Fosas have also been cited as feeding on the 1 kg endemic and endangered rodent Votsovotsa Hypogeomys antimena, which is known only from a limited area in central western Madagascar ; heavy predation pressure and poor recruitment of young into the breeding population have been cited as reasons for the rodent’s rarity. However, based on the analysis of Fosa scat obtained within this rodent’s range, it represents a small proportion of the Fosa’s diet. Fosa is notably adapted for hunting both on the ground and in trees. It is often seen foraging solitarily, but during the austral spring breeding season has been observed hunting communally; these foraging parties are presumably of male-female pairs. At other times of the year, mothers and their young hunt together. One Fosa will chase lemurs in trees, scaling the trunks and leaping from tree to tree, forcing the lemurs to the ground, where its hunting partners easily catch them. The Fosa’s semi-retractable claws help it grip trees and its long tail, which is not prehensile, acts as a balancing device. Activity patterns. In the eastern and more mesic portions of the island, Fosa demonstrate highly irregular periods of activity during the day and night and is best considered cathemeral. Two radio-collared individuals showed periods of peak activity soon after dawn, in the mid-afternoon, and late at night. The same general pattern has been found in drier forests in western Madagascar . Solitary individuals do not use the same sleeping sites on a regular basis, but females with young frequent the same den. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In recent years several studies using radio collars on these animals have been conducted in the dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar . In the Kirindy ( CFPF ) Forest, north of Morondava, densities have been estimated at one animal per 4 km *; females had home ranges of up to 13 km * and males up to 26 km *. The home ranges of different individuals were not necessarily mutually exclusive, but those of females tended to be separate from one another. Home ranges showed seasonal variation, with notable expansion during the dry season;this is apparently related to food and water availability. The adult sex ratio is 1:1. Animals have been documented to move a straight-line distance of over 7 km in 16 h. On the basis of limited radio-tracking data from the eastern humid forests, home ranges overlapped by approximately 30%. Fosa make few vocalizations, most associated with mating. Olfactory communication seems to be common throughout the year, by scent marking prominent objects such as rocks and trees, or the ground, with a secretion from the anal and chest glands, as well as genitalia. Outside the breeding season, it is rare to find adults together, except for females with their young. Female Fosa show transient masculization: individuals 1-2 years old have an enlarged,spiny clitoris, which is physically supported by a bone-like structure, the os clitoridis, and visually resembles a penis. In these females the masculization does not appear to be associated with a pseudo-scrotum. In adult females the length of the os clitoridis decreases as body length increases. This change is not linked in juvenile (masculinized) and adult (nonmasculinized) females to different levels of hormones (testosterone, androstenedione, dihydrotestosterone).

Breeding. Most details of reproduction in wild populations are from the western dry deciduous forests. Copulation occurs between September and December and young are born in December and January. There are conflicting reports of the gestation period in Fosa, ranging from 6-7 weeks to approximately 90 days. Whether certain of these details are applicable to eastern populations will require further field research. Reported observations of copulation in the eastern humid forest were in October. Pairs copulate on horizontal tree branches, generally about 20 cm in diameter and up to 20 m off the ground; there are also reports of intromission on the ground. Mating sites are generally near water sources. Numerous males remain in close vicinity to the receptive female. The female lays belly-down, grasps the substrate with the claws of her forelimbs, with the hind limbs tucked underneath her, and extrudes the genital opening a few centimeters. She gives a series of mewing vocalizations, which seems to stimulate the male to mount her. He mounts from behind, slightly to one side, grasps the female around the waist with his forelimbs, and often licks her neck. There is a copulatory tie, which is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation is repeated several times with a single male and the mating bout can last from one to 14 hours; males often remain close to the females for up to an hour after the sequence has finished. The trees where these annual mating sessions take place are often reused for years, and with remarkable precision as to the date the season commences. As many as eight males can be found around the mating site. With considerable vocalizing, there are antagonistic interactions among them as they compete to have access to the receptive female. Females seem to choose the males they mate with. Their choices are apparently not correlated with morphometric parameters in males, nor do they determine the length of an intromission bout. Over the course of several days a given female will mate with more than one male . In one case, documented by Claire Hawkins, a receptive female remained in the branches of a tree for a week, mating with numerous males. The female was then replaced by another receptive female, who mated with some of the males that had serviced the previous female as well as with newly arriving males. The litter size is generally two, although up to six young have been recorded. Birthing sites include concealed underground dens, rock crevices, or hollows in large tree trunks or termite mounds. Females raise their young alone and have three pairs of nipples—one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral. The neonates, weighing less than 100 g at birth, have almost white fur and are blind and toothless. Cub developmentis slow, with the eyes opening about 2-3 weeks after birth. Thereafter they become more active and there is a notable darkening of the fur to a pearl gray color. Litters are of mixed sexes, contrary to some previous assertions. The cubs leave the natal den for the first time around 4-5 months of age and become independent of their mother at about one year. The Fosa gets its permanent teeth at about 1-5 years and the young are sexually mature at 3—4 years of age. On following pages: 2. Falanouc ( Eupleres goudotii); 3.

Little is known about the genetic structure of wild populations, which is certainly a critical question in the development of long-term conservation programs.","Albignac (1970, 1972, 1973, 1975, 1984) | Blancou (1968) | Conservation Breeding Specialist Group ( SSC / IUCN) | (2002) | Decary (1950) | Dollar (1999a, 2006) | Dollar et al.

Fosa Cryptoprocta ferox French: Fossa / German: Fossa / Spanish: Fosa Other common names: Fossa , Tratraka , Kintsala Taxonomy. Cryptoprocta ferox Bennett, 1833 , Madagascar . The interpretation of the systematic position of C. ferox has varied over the years, because these animals possess characteristics seemingly diagnostic of the families Herpestidae , Viverridae , and Felidae . The ambiguities in understanding the evolution of this genus are now partially resolved. Apparently, all native Madagascar Carnivores represent a monophyletic endemic lineage derived from a single colonization of the island. They are now placed in the family Eupleridae . Cryptoprocta typicus is a synonym of C. ferox. A notably larger form of this genus, C. spelea, was identified from bone remains recovered from Holocene sites. At some of these sites remains of both C. spelea and C. ferox have been found, but due to a lack ofstratigraphic control it is unknown if they were temporally sympatric. The name C. antamba applied to some subfossil remains appears to be a teratological C. spelea. In different parts of Madagascar , people living in the countryside note the presence of two forms of Cryptoprocta —fosa mainty or “black Cryptoprocta’ and fosa mena or “reddish Cryptoprocta ”; the red form is said to be smaller. In the extreme south-west there are reports of a whitish morphotype. It remains unclear whether the differentiation of these formsis simply folklore or is associated with some general pattern of variation (age, sex, geographic) in extant C. ferox. Monotypic. Distribution. Madagascar . Descriptive notes. Head-body 70-80 cm, tail 65-70 cm, hindfoot 12-12. 8 cm ; weight 6.2-8. 6 kg (males) and 5.5-6. 8 kg (females). Sexually dimorphic, with males being larger. There have been previous reports of individuals weighing up to 20 kg ; either these measurements are incorrect or perhaps from unnaturally heavy captive animals. There is some indication of geographic variation in external measurements across the range of this species, but this needs further substantiation, as sample sizes are not extensive. This animal resembles a small Puma, with a sleek muscular body, long torso, and tail length nearly equivalent to head-body length. Fosa has a relatively short muzzle and short rounded ears. The pelage is fine and relatively dense, generally with uniform, pale, reddish-brown upperparts and dirty cream underparts. In some individuals, particularly males, the venter is colored orange from gland secretions. Habitat. Fosa is largely forest-dwelling. It is known from near sea level to 2600 m elevation. It occurs in all of the different natural forest types on Madagascar from the wettest (greater than 6000 mm of annual rainfall) to the driest zones (less than 400 mm ). This species appears to have higher population densities in the lowland western dry deciduous forests than in the lowland eastern rainforests. Densities decrease with increasing elevation in both sectors. Fosas are also found in the remaining forested islands in the central highlands. They are known on the Andringitra Massif from about 750 m (lower limit of the forest) to 2600 m (above forest line); this latter zone has extreme meteorological conditions with daily temperatures in August ranging from —-11°C to 30°C. Previous reports ofthis species on the off-shore island of Ile Sainte Marie are erroneous: the locality was Sainte Marie de Marovoay, not far from Mahajanga. Food and Feeding. The Fosa’s large size, considerable strength, carnassial teeth, broad paw pads, highly flexible ankle joints, and semi-retractable claws make it a formidable carnivore, the top predator of Madagascar . In captivity these animals eat 800-1000 g of meat per day. Wild populations have a broad dietary regime, at least in part associated with local prey availability. There appears to be no differences between the sexes in dietary regime. Fosa has been reported to feed on mammals, birds, snakes, lizards, freshwater turtles, and insects. In recent years several analyses of scats have been conducted to determine the diet of this animal, across the different biomes it inhabits. The scats of Fosa are easy to recognize; they form thin 10-14 cm long and 1.5-2. 5 cm wide rolls, with at least one of the ends twisted. Most examples are gray in color; they often contain hair and mammalian bone fragments. At the majority ofsites, mammals are the most important prey. Both by number of individuals and biomass, lemurs are regular elements in the Fosa’s diet; the larger diurnal species of lemurs are at least in part taken from their arboreal sleeping sites. In the dry deciduous forests of Kirindy Centre de Formation Professionnelle Forestiere ( CFPF ), primates comprise over 80% of the biomass and nearly 60% based on relative frequency of the prey taken. In the dry deciduous forests of Ankarafantsika, larger lemur species (Eulemur spp. and Verreaux’s Sikafa Propithecus verreauxi) are overrepresented in the diet of Fosa as compared to their relative local densities, while notably smaller species (mouse lemurs Microcebus spp. and Lesser Dwarf Lemur Cheirogaleus medius) are underrepresented. At this site there are notable seasonal shifts in the types of lemurs taken by Fosa. Fosas also take a wide variety of non-primate prey and clearly have considerable dietary plasticity. They are known to feed on other Eupleridae ; Fosa was a serious problem in a study of the Spotted Fanaloka, where it followed trap lines and preyed on captured individuals. Bone remains of Narrow-striped Boky have been found in its scats. Fosa can be a voracious chicken predator. During the dry season in western deciduous forests there is a notable increase in the number of chicken remains in scats. Towards a 2000 m summit in the south-east, small tenrecs of the genera Microgale and Oryzorictes (Oryzorictinae), all with adult body mass ofless than 35 g , were found in Fosa scats. Above the tree line in the high mountain zone of Andringitra, birds, rodents, and shrew tenrecs (Microgale) are important components of this animal’s diet; to a lesser extent, their diet includes frogs and crabs. Further, at thissite the average prey body mass is only 40 g , including vertebrates weighing less than 10 g . This contrasts with an average prey body mass of 480 g in the humid forests of the north and 1140 g in the western dry deciduous forests. Some of the prey animals found in the Andringitra scats recovered above tree line were of forest-dwelling animals, indicating that these Fosas have notably large home ranges and do not rely completely on the prey base available above the forest. Fosas are known to take prey nearly their own weight, such as 6 kg lemurs of the genus Propithecus, but assertions that the Fosa is a lemur specialist, with these animals representing more than 50% of its diet, cannot be supported acrossits complete geographic range. Bone fragments of even larger animals, such as cows and bush pigs (Potamochoerus), have been found in Fosa scats and it is presumed that these are scavenged. Fosas have also been cited as feeding on the 1 kg endemic and endangered rodent Votsovotsa Hypogeomys antimena, which is known only from a limited area in central western Madagascar ; heavy predation pressure and poor recruitment of young into the breeding population have been cited as reasons for the rodent’s rarity.

Non-retractable claws on the forelimbs are very well-developed. When walking, the claws touch the ground, which gives the animal a slow and sauntering gait. In the nominate subspecies, the dense and soft body and tail fur are a uniform reddish-brown and the venter a brownish-beige. Eupleres g. major is darker in color, with the dorsum and tail a dark brown grizzled with gray, and the thighs and underparts often have an orangish tinge.","The nominate form occurs across the eastern portion of the island at elevations from about 50 to 1600 m . Based on current limited data, it seems to prefer tracts of upland humid forest with natural aquatic habitats, and areas of marshland dominated by Cyperus and Raphia. There are a few observations of this animal in dense mesic forests away from aquatic and marshland habitats. On Montagne d’Ambre in the far north, this species can be seen with some regularity in an open grassy field that is seasonally flooded, close to irregularly used human habitations, and within 50 m of the forest edge. Even less is known about the habitat of the Wand NW form, E. g. major. This animal appears to have a relatively limited distribution, with most records coming from the Sambirano Region. However,it has been recorded as far south as the Baie de Baly near Soalala. Its preferred habitat has been cited as undisturbed forest areas and wetlands with Raphia and Afromomum; there is little in the way of undisturbed lowland forest in the Sambirano Region and the two cited plant genera are probably introduced to Madagascar . Much remains to be learned about this animal’s habitat requirements and distribution. This species might occur on the Manongarivo Massif, but two separate expeditions to different portions of this mountain found no evidence that it did. The geographical distribution of the two subspecies needs further research. The nominate form has been reported from the Tsaratanana Massif, a portion of which falls within the Sambirano Domain, a zone that has been cited as the stronghold of E. g. major. The previously cited record of this species on Ile Sainte Marie, an offshore island in the east, is actually from Sainte Marie de Marovoay, in the west, near a large marsh system and not far from the Ankarafantsika reserve.","The dentition of Falanouc is notably reduced, with tiny conical and flattened cusps, adapted to a soft-bodied invertebrate diet.

Ring-tailed Vontsira Galidia elegans French: Galidie a queue annelée / German: Ringelschwanzmungo / Spanish: Galidia de cola anillada Other common names: Ring-tailed Mongoose , Vontsira , Vontsira Mena , Kokia , Vontsika Taxonomy. Galidia elegans Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1837 , Madagascar , subsequently restricted to the region of “Tamatave” [= Toamasina ]. The relationships between the subspecies have not been examined in a modern phylogeographic sense and in certain cases the characters used to separate them are ambiguous. The subspecific status of certain geographically intermediate populations remains unresolved (e.g. Sambirano Basin, lake region to the west of Bemaraha, and the forests near Daraina). Captive hybrids between these different geographical forms produce fertile young. Three subspecies recognized. Subspecies and distribution. G. e. elegans Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1837 — E Madagascar (from the region surrounding the Andapa Basin S to Tolagnaro). G. e. dambrensis Tate & Rand, 1941 — N Madagascar (originally described from Montagne d’Ambre, but animals at Ankarana are also referable to this form). G. e. occidentalis Albignac, 1971 — CW Madagascar (limestone regions of Bemaraha, Namoroka & Kelifely). Descriptive notes. Measurements of the nominate form elegans: head-body 30-38 cm, tail 26-29. 1 cm , hindfoot 6.7-2 cm, ear 2.8-3 cm; weight 6565-965 g. The external measurements of the other subspecies largely overlap. There is some indication of sexual dimorphism in body size based on measurements made at Ranomafana in the eastern humid forest— eight adult males averaged 992 g (range 900-1085 g) and two adult females weighed 760 and 890 g respectively. The body form is typically mongoose-like (hence the inappropriate English common name “Ring-tailed Mongoose” that has been used in the past), with relatively short feet and a fluffy furred tail that is slightly more than two-thirds of the body length. The nominate form is the darkest, with body coloration a somber dark or reddish-chestnut, throat fulvous, top and sides of the head fulvous grizzled with black, and venter, feet and flanks nearly black. There is considerable variation in the pelage coloration of this subspecies, particularly with regard to the venter. The tail is marked with five to seven alternating dark reddishbrown and nearly black bands. The ears are noticeable, but not prominent, and are edged with a light-colored border. The other recognized subspecies tend to be paler than the nominate form, without dark venters, but the characters generally used to differentiate them are highly variable. Galidia e. dambrensis tends to have five dark tail rings. Ring-tailed Vontsira have relatively large feet, with well-developed and naked footpads. There is also webbing at the bases of the toes. The hindfeet are longer than the forefeet, and the claws are not retractable. These various adaptations allow the Ring-tailed Vontsira to walk and run on the ground, climb trees, and swim. Habitat. This species is the most conspicuous native carnivoran on the island, and occurs in most types of natural forest formations with the exception of the southern portion of the western deciduous forest and the south-western spiny bush. Populations in eastern Madagascar are known from littoral forests on sandy substrates and close to sea level, through the complete range of eastern humid forests up to the forest line at 1950 m . The Ring-tailed Vontsira can be seen short distances from relatively intact forest, in secondary forest and even in clearings. In the far northern end of the island, G. e. dambrensis occurs in the distinctly humid forests of Montagne d’Ambre, which grow on lateritic soils, from about 650 m to the summital zone at 1475 m , as well as in areas of mixed mesic-dry deciduous forest within the exposed karst of Ankarana. Galidia e. occidentalis is known from widely separated zones of limestone and occurs in canyons and zones with relatively mesic habitat. Animals recorded at Tsimembo, in close proximity to Bemaraha and outside of the limestone zone, are presumably of this subspecies. Food and Feeding. This species is omnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of small mammals (rodents, tenrecs, and lemurs), aquatic animals (fish and frogs), reptiles (including large snakes), invertebrates (crabs, crayfish, snails, worms, pill millipedes, and insects, including larvae), as well as bird eggs. It has been recorded digging rodents weighing up to 200 g out of burrows, and feeding on different species of lemur, the largest being Eastern Wooly Lemur Avahi laniger, which weighs on average 1-2 kg. It is not clear whether Ring-tailed Vontsira caught the Avahi or stole it from a bird of prey. On several occasions, Ring-tailed Vontsira have been observed resting silently at the edge of small streams, then leaping into the water and seizing prey that was presumed to be fish, frogs, or crayfish. The partially webbed forefeet help with aquatic propulsion to subdue prey. Ring-tailed Vontsiras are camp pests; once accustomed to the presence of humans they do not hesitate to raid food supplies or scavenge in camp trash. They are reputed by rural villagers to feed on poultry. This vontsira has a semidigitgrade gait and notably fleshy footpads that aid it in climbing nearly vertical tree trunks, fine horizontal branches, and lianas. This species has the ability to jump from horizontal to vertical vegetation. The population at Montagne d’Ambre (dambrensis) often searches for food in trees, up to 15 m off the ground. Here animals frequently can be seen probing in tree holes and epiphytic plants for invertebrates and small vertebrates, which they consume immediately upon capture. In the eastern central lowland, at Betampona, nearly 13% of all observations were in arboreal situations, generally less than 5 m off the ground, although in one case an animal was found at around 12 m . Various diurnal forest birds will mob this carnivore, presumably because of its habit of stealing eggs and young birds from nests. In the eastern humid forests, Ring-tailed Vontsira is sympatric with other relatively small carnivores, particularly the slightly larger Broad-striped Vontsira and the slightly smaller Brown-tailed Vontsira. Temporal niche separation may reduce competition between Ring-tailed Vontsira, which is diurnal, and Galidictis , which is nocturnal. Few details are available on the diet of the latter species to evaluate this hypothesis. A comparative study at Betampona, where the largely diurnal Brown-tailed Vontsira and Ring-tailed Vontsira co-occur, noted a number of differences between them in prey type and habitat utilization. Activity patterns. Recent work on radio-collared Ring-tailed Vontsira has demonstrated that they are not exclusively diurnal, as previously thought, but are occasionally active during the night. Ring-tailed Vontsiras tend to have bouts of activity in the early morning and late afternoon. They are generally considered to be terrestrial, but are agile climbers oftrees. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Roland Albignac conducted fieldwork on this species in several different forest types and consistently estimated home range size, extrapolated from trapping studies, to be 20 to 25 ha. On the basis of a short-term capture-mark-release study in humid forest in the Ranomafana National Park, the density index was estimated to be 37 animals per km? which may be a slight overestimation. An animal marked in the humid forest in the extreme south-east at 810 m elevation was observed several days later at 1200 m , a straight-line distance of about 2-5 km. In some zones it can reach noticeably high densities. For example, at 1000 m on Montagne d’Ambre, it was very common in the mid-1990s. During the course of seven days of trapping at this locality, with 20 carnivore traps set each day, more than 28 Ring-tailed Vontsira were captured in a relatively limited area. This forested site has high densities of introduced Rattus, which the Ring-tailed Vontsira feed upon. Little is published about the social organization of this species in the wild, but based on field studies it appearsto live, at least seasonally, solitarily or in small groups of three to four individuals. The small groups presumably are composed of a male-female pair and their sub-adult young. Aggressive encounters between individuals, particularly adult males, often include a distinctive submissive display by the non-dominant animal. The submissive animal bends the front limbs so the chest practically touches the ground, the ears are folded backwards, the teeth exposed, and the snout is pointed up, almost touching the face of the dominant animal. When the dominant individual approaches, the submissive animal gives a loud, high-pitched screeching vocalization. Trapped animals produce a two-part threat call, a guttural growl followed by a raspy spitting sound. This species is rather vocal and its auditory signals have been classified into four types : a whistle-like contact call between family members, often given while moving through the forest; a specific prey capture call; growl and shrill screams as intimidation, attack or defense calls; and a copulation vocalization. Adults regularly scent-mark within their home range using urine and a form of musk produced by their perineal, cheek, and sub-mandibular glands. Dens of this species have been found in a variety of settings, and it is capable of digging its own burrow systems. In exposed sedimentary rock zones, such as the Bemaraha Plateau, lairs have been found in rock crevices and subterranean passages. In the humid forests of the east, dens tend to be in the ground underlarge trees, in carved-outsoil fissures along riverbanks, or in the hollow bases of large standing trees or downed hollow logs. Often the dens have numerous openings. They are not necessarily used by the same individuals on consecutive nights. Breeding. Mating in the eastern forests generally takes place between July and November. The gestation period is about 75 days and litter size is one. Females have one pair of inguinal mammae. Before copulation the male pursues the female with increasing intensity and both animals mark prominent objects with the cheek and sub-mandibular glands. Males frequently sniff the females’ urogenital region. Copulation takes place after the female solicits the male by lowering and quivering the anterior portion of the body and slowly treading the hindquarters. Neck biting was not observed in this species. Individual copulation bouts usually last 10-30 seconds and the complete sequence of 7-12 copulations takes place during a period of 15-80 minutes. Neonates are fully furred, generally weigh between 40 and 50 g , and have the same pelage coloration as adults. The auditory canal is open at birth, the eyes open on day 4, the incisors erupt on day 8, and the premolars on day 21. Walking commences at day 12. Weaning takes place at approximately 2 to 2-5 months and the young start to hunt small prey at three months; they retain the deciduous dentition until seven months. After the young become active, they can be seen foraging in the forest with their parents; they probably remain with their parents for up to one year, when they reach adult size. They reach reproductive age at two years. There is some evidence that in some portions of this species’ range, females may reproduce twice in good years. This might explain pairs being observed with two young of different sizes. Status and Conservation. Listed in The IUCN Red List as Least Concern. The result of a Conservation Breeding Specialist Group workshop sponsored by the SSC / IUCN held in 2001 and attended by specialists working on Madagascar Carnivores gave the status of G. e. elegans and G. e. occidentalis as Least Concern and that of G. e. dambrensis as Vulnerable. Continued reduction of forest cover across this species’ range is a major pressure on existing populations. Perhaps of less importance is the utilization of body parts of this animal, particularly in the southern portions of its range, for various medicinal and supernatural potions, as well as its being hunted for bush meat. It can be found at the ecotone between forest and anthropogenic zones, where it is in contact and conflict with people and their domestic animals. Ring-tailed Vontsira are considered poultry raiders and are hunted and persecuted. Their bad reputation may not be deserved, since Ring-tailed Vontsira is a conspicuous diurnal animal. In general, given the wide distribution of Ring-tailed Vontsira on Madagascar and their relatively high densities in certain areas, they are among the less threatened native Carnivora on the island. Further, they occur in regenerating forests, cross open areas between forest fragments, and are seen where there are non-native trees in close proximity to native forests. Bibliography.

After the recent description of this species based on two modern specimens, one of which had precise collection information, subfossil remains were identified from a cave about 50 km south ofthis site. If the subfossil remains had been studied before the recent description of this taxon, it would have been named as an extinct taxon. Monotypic.",Extreme SW Madagascar .,"Head-body 45-48 cm, tail 30-32. 6 cm , ear 9.9-5 cm, hindfoot 3.9-4. 5 cm ; weight 1.1-5 kg. Recent fieldwork of|. Jeglinski and colleagues has provided additional body mass data: one adult male weighed 1723 g and four adult females had a mean weight of 1494 g . Other than body mass, there is no evidence of sexual dimorphism in this species. The body is typically mongoose-like, with a relatively long pointed snout. The bushy tail lacks rings and is a little less than one-half of the head and body length. The dorsal and ventral pelage is dark grayish-beige, the tail white, and the rostrum and feet grizzled reddish-brown. The distal portions of the ears are covered with a fine layer of short fur. Eight dark brown longitudinal stripes on the dorsum, all roughly parallel and about 5-7 mm wide, run from behind the ears and converge at the base of the tail. The 8-12 mm spaces between thestripes are white and slightly wider than the stripes but with considerable variation between individuals. The feet are notably elongated and there is webbing between the toes. The hindfeet are longer than the forefeet. The claws are long and non-retractable.","This species occurs in the rugged limestone zone to the south of the Onilahy River known as the Mahafaly Plateau, which is aligned along a north-south axis. It is known from an elevational range of 35 to 145 m. This portion ofthe island receives on average less than 400 m of rainfall per year and daily temperatures can exceed 40°C. Soon after its original description in 1986, Grandidier’s Vontsira was “rediscovered” in the portion of the Mahafaly Plateau just to the east of the coastal plain comprising the large alkaline Lac Tsimanampetsotsa; one of the type specimens was collected at this site. Grandidier’s Vontsira can be found in two distinct local xerophytic vegetational communities: at the base of the plateau, which is dominated by Didierea madagascariensis ( Didiereaceae ) and a variety of Euphorbiaceae and Burseraceae ; and in the spiny bush formation on the exposed limestone escarpment on the western portion of the Mahafaly Plateau. At numerous sites on the lower western side of the plateau, there is the resurgence of an underground aquifer along a north-south geological fault. Considerable portions of the upland and eastern portions of the plateau are without water sources for tens of kilometers. Most of the recent sightings ofthis species are at sites along this fault line, where there are natural water sources. While it is unknown if Galidictis is obliged to drink water on a regular basis, the prey base near these water sourcesis higher in density and diversity than surrounding areas without water.","Little is known about the food habits of this Vontsira. During an ornithological expedition to Lac Tsimanampetsotsa in 1929, this carnivore was found soon after dark digging up the carcasses of skinned birds. On the basis of some unpublished scat analyses of material collected at Lac Tsimanampetsotsa, it feeds predominantly on invertebrates. By far the most common was hissing cockroaches ( Gromphadorhina ). Other prey types include locusts, scorpions, and rarely, vertebrates. There is some evidence that it might feed on radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) and perhaps carrion. Activity patterns. Grandidier’s Vontsira is strictly nocturnal, becoming active shortly after sunset and returning to its den well before dawn. It was thought to be exclusively terrestrial, but recent observations ofJ. Jeglinski indicate that it climbs in trees. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Few details are currently available, but an ongoing radio-tracking study by researchers from the University of Hamburg should fill in numerous details. Preliminary results, based on a trapping study, indicate that minimum densities are about five animals per km®. Current data indicate that the home range of malesis relatively large and probably overlapping between individuals, resulting in lower density than the females. In one case, an animal moved during a single night 1-5 km direct-line distance. Solitary individuals and groups of two are frequently observed. More rarely, groups of up to five are seen. Observations of single animals are most likely predominantly of males; pairs are generally of females with their offspring; and sightings of three or more animals are disproportionately of males. In male groups, aggressive interactions can be observed and the females generally initiate these encounters towards the males. Easily visible at night, the white tail probably has an important signaling function. This species places its dens in the labyrinth of holes and caves in the karstic limestone making up the Mahafaly Plateau. These are generally located in areas of exposed rock without vegetation and generally associated with nearby latrine sites. In a few known cases, the crevices reach depths of several meters, where these animals can escape the intense day heat. One den was found in a hollow tree about 3 m off the ground. On the basis of a radiotracking study, during a period of 16 consecutive days, a female with juvenile utilized seven different dens aligned along the limestone cliff across a maximum distance of 1 km . Current evidence seems to indicate that the same burrow is not necessarily used on consecutive days. There is no evidence that this species excavates burrows, but given the rocky substrate it lives on, this is not unexpected. Latrine sites are notably conspicuous and found near prominent features of the landscape (e.g., hill crests, prominent rocks, and outcrops).",,"Grandidier’s Vontsira is strictly nocturnal, becoming active shortly after sunset and returning to its den well before dawn.

It has been proposed that there is not a fixed reproductive season in this species, and they breed throughout the year. During a rapid survey at Lac Tsimanampetsotsa in November 1989 , a number of captured females were in different stages of reproduction, including lactating, pregnant, and in estrus; sub-adults of different ages were also trapped. Thus,it was concluded that this species breeds throughout the year. However, given the high degree of seasonality of meteorological patterns, particularly rainfall, it is assumed that the prey base of Grandidier’s Vontsira would show notable fluctuations. These patterns might be partially offset in places by the permanent water sources along the fault line. Recent data document some seasonality in the testicle volume of adult males, which suggests some seasonality in reproduction. However, females were observed during the same period with offspring of notably different sizes, which supports the hypothesis that reproductive activity is not seasonal. A specimen collected in March had two placental scars, which would indicate a litter size of up to two. Females have one pair of inguinal mammae.","Listed in The IUCN Red List as Endangered. However, the result of a Conservation Breeding Specialist Group workshop sponsored by the [UCN/ SSC held in 2001 and attended by specialists working on Madagascar Carnivores gave the status of this species as Threatened. The calculated surface area of the narrow band of habitat where Grandidier’s Vontsira has been observed is 442 km ?, of which 118 km ? falls within the Parc National de Tsimanampetsotsa. On the basis of preliminary trapping data from different areas along the Mahafaly Plateau, a rough estimate of 6-8 individuals per km* has been advanced. This translates to a population within its known distribution of approximately 2650-3540 animals. Recently, based on more extensive trapping data, an estimate of five individuals per km* has been suggested, which provides an estimate of about 2200. A significant portion ofits range is in a zone of relatively undisturbed spiny bush habitat at the western edge of the Mahafaly Plateau and in a region that has been proposed for an extension of the Parc National de Tsimanampetsotsa. This zone is relatively free of heavy anthropogenic pressure, other than browsing by cattle, which occurs mostly at the foot of the plateau, and some exploitation of forest resources for local utilization (construction wood and medicinal plants).","Conservation Breeding Specialist Group ( SSC / IUCN) | (2002) | Goodman (1996b) | Goodman, Ganzhorn & Rakotondravony (2003) | Goodman, Raherilalao et al.

Galidictis grandidiensis Wozencraft, 1986 , Madagascar . Galidictis grandidiensis was subsequently emended to G. grandidieri . After the recent description of this species based on two modern specimens, one of which had precise collection information, subfossil remains were identified from a cave about 50 km south ofthis site. If the subfossil remains had been studied before the recent description of this taxon, it would have been named as an extinct taxon. Monotypic. Distribution. Extreme SW Madagascar . Descriptive notes. Head-body 45-48 cm, tail 30-32. 6 cm , ear 9.9-5 cm, hindfoot 3.9-4. 5 cm ; weight 1.1-5 kg. Recent fieldwork of|. Jeglinski and colleagues has provided additional body mass data: one adult male weighed 1723 g and four adult females had a mean weight of 1494 g . Other than body mass, there is no evidence of sexual dimorphism in this species. The body is typically mongoose-like, with a relatively long pointed snout. The bushy tail lacks rings and is a little less than one-half of the head and body length. The dorsal and ventral pelage is dark grayish-beige, the tail white, and the rostrum and feet grizzled reddish-brown. The distal portions of the ears are covered with a fine layer of short fur. Eight dark brown longitudinal stripes on the dorsum, all roughly parallel and about 5-7 mm wide, run from behind the ears and converge at the base of the tail. The 8-12 mm spaces between thestripes are white and slightly wider than the stripes but with considerable variation between individuals. The feet are notably elongated and there is webbing between the toes. The hindfeet are longer than the forefeet. The claws are long and non-retractable. Habitat. This species occurs in the rugged limestone zone to the south of the Onilahy River known as the Mahafaly Plateau, which is aligned along a north-south axis. It is known from an elevational range of 35 to 145 m. This portion ofthe island receives on average less than 400 m of rainfall per year and daily temperatures can exceed 40°C. Soon after its original description in 1986, Grandidier’s Vontsira was “rediscovered” in the portion of the Mahafaly Plateau just to the east of the coastal plain comprising the large alkaline Lac Tsimanampetsotsa; one of the type specimens was collected at this site. Grandidier’s Vontsira can be found in two distinct local xerophytic vegetational communities: at the base of the plateau, which is dominated by Didierea madagascariensis ( Didiereaceae ) and a variety of Euphorbiaceae and Burseraceae ; and in the spiny bush formation on the exposed limestone escarpment on the western portion of the Mahafaly Plateau. At numerous sites on the lower western side of the plateau, there is the resurgence of an underground aquifer along a north-south geological fault. Considerable portions of the upland and eastern portions of the plateau are without water sources for tens of kilometers. Most of the recent sightings ofthis species are at sites along this fault line, where there are natural water sources. While it is unknown if Galidictis is obliged to drink water on a regular basis, the prey base near these water sourcesis higher in density and diversity than surrounding areas without water.

The previous statement that the type locality is the “east coast of Madagascar ” is incorrect . An animal from the Toliara region was described as Galidictis vittata. This species was subsequently transferred to the genus Mungotictis by Pocock, which contained two species: M. vittatus, which was preoccupied by G. wvittata, and M. substriatus, which was renamed as M. lineatus. To further complicate the situation, Pocock was apparently unaware of the description of Galidia decemlineata, the senior synonym that replaced vittatus (sensu Gray, 1848). Finally, R . Albignac divided the species into two geographic forms, M. d. decemlineata and M. d. lineata, but the single specimen he referred to the latter form was actually of Grandidier’s Vontsira. The name M. d. lineata has been retained for the south-western population, which until 2005 was only known from a single specimen associated with M. lineatus. M. d. lineata is maintained here as a geographical form. Several measurement and pelage coloration characters separate this population from those occurring farther north. These differences may warrant the two geographical forms being recognized as full species; molecular studies should help to resolve this point. Two subspecies recognized.","M. d. decemlineata Grandidier, 1867 — CW Madagascar (Menabe region). M. d. lineata Pocock, 1915 — SW Madagascar (S of the Mangoky River). The previous records ofthis form in the Lac Tsimanampetsotsa area are misidentified specimens of Grandidier’s Vontsira.","Adults of the nominate form from the central Menabe region, M. d. decemlineata: head-body 26.4-29. 4 cm , tail 19.1-20. 9 cm , hindfoot 6.6-2 cm, ear 2-4— 2-5 cm; weight of adult males is 475-625 g, adult females is 450-740 g, and juveniles 350-490 g. No apparent sexual dimorphism in external measurements. Measurements of an adult female M. d. lineata include: head-body 33-5 cm,tail 21-5 cm, hindfoot 5-9 cm, ear 2-5 cm. The Narrow-striped Boky’s long, pointed snout, cylindrical body, short legs, and long bushy tail easily distinguish this relatively small animal from other Madagascar Carnivores. The dorsal pelage coloration of the nominate form is a grizzled gray mixed with light brown or beige and is characterized by eight to ten broadly-spaced, thin longitudinal stripes running from the nape to the base ofthe tail. The venter and legs are monochrome pale brownish-beige to pale orangish-brown. The ears are short and rounded. The light gray tail is without stripes or rings. There is webbing between the toes and the claws are long. Mungotictis d. lineata has a darker dorsum and the back stripes are darker and more distinct. They start as well-defined stripes higher on the nape andjust behind the ears. The venteris distinctly darker than the nominate form’s and approaches a russet color.","In the central and northern portions ofits distribution, the Narrow-striped Boky occurs at elevations from near sea level to 400 m in dry deciduous forests on sandy substrate. Baobab trees are often the dominant vegetation. These forested zones tend to have relatively intact habitat, with a dense understory and notably homogenous vegetational structure and floristic composition. The Tsiribihina River formsits northern distributional limit. This species tends to be distinctly more common in the larger areas of native forest and is uncommon, absent or extirpated from smaller and degraded forest blocks. In 2004, an individual referable to M. d. lineata was captured on the southern bank of the Manombo River at approximately 400 m above sea level and in dry deciduous forest. On both banks of the river, thin alluvial soils support a 25-50 m wide band of disturbed gallery forest immediately adjacent to the flood plain. Beyond this, the gallery forest gives way to dry deciduous forest, with a taller canopy layer.","Narrow-striped Boky is primarily insectivorous. In one study 69 of 71 scats contained insects. Particularly during the extended dry-cold season, it feeds largely on insect larvae, which are extracted by digging them out from soil or rotten wood. This speciesis also known to feed on a variety of vertebrates, including reptiles, birds, and small mammals (tenrecs, shrew-tenrecs, native rodents, and lemurs), as well as other invertebrates such as snails. Scat analyses found a variety of primate remains, including Gray Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus), Lesser Dwarf Lemur, Giant Mouse Lemur (Mirza coquereli), and Red-tailed Sportive Lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), of which the Red-tailed Sportive Lemur, weighing close to 850 g , is the largest and was probably scavenged. Remains of the rodent Votsovotsa, which can weigh over 1 kg ,also were found and presumably were also the result of scavenging. There are records of this species cooperatively hunting prey such as mouse-lemurs, adults of which weigh more than 50 g . Based on local folklore, Narrow-striped Boky is reputed to feed on large boas and regularly on wild honey. There is no evidence of extensive fat storage before the onset of the dry season. Activity patterns. Narrow-striped Boky is largely diurnal, but on occasion can be active at night. This speciesis considered scansorial; it mainly moves on the ground but can climb and descend trees, including vertical surfaces. It has been reported to swim, but no recent confirmation of this behavioris available. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Earlier studies, largely of Narrowstriped Boky in captivity, concluded that they were not particularly social but tend to live in couples. Recent research in the wild indicates that they are notably gregarious and have a complex social system with some particularly interesting intricacies. In a telemetry study conducted in the Kirindy forest Centre de Formation Professionnelle Forestiére by L.. Razafimanantsoa, 26 animals ( 20 adults and six sub-adults) were captured and marked in an area of about 90 ha. These animals belonged to different groups and included dispersing solitary individuals. A good proportion of the marked animals were not seen again in the study area, which was occupied by two different groups. The first group was composed of two adult females, an adult male, a sub-adult female, and one of the previous season’s young; the second group was two adult females and a sub-adult male. The home range ofthe first group was calculated as about 18 ha and the second group 13 ha. These figures are notably smaller than previous inferred estimates of 20-25 ha. The ranges of the two groups overlapped over an area of about 1-5 ha. In the overlap zone, group members intensively scent-marked using glandular secretions and no aggressive interactions were observed between them. Based on these radio-tracking studies, individual Narrow-striped Boky can traverse a distance of 2200 m in a single day, of which two-thirds is covered during the morning. This species often can be observed in groups with three to five adults , and depending on the season, with numerous sub-adults. Groups of more than ten individuals have been observed and, in certain areas, the age and sex ratio remains stable over the course of years. As a group moves through the forest, the alpha female plays the role of “leader”. After mating, the males will generally leave the female group for several months. Lone individuals can be observed, particularly towards the end of the dry season, and these are presumed to be solitary males. During the mating period, males were tolerant of visiting males and even allowed them to copulate with group females. Some marked males visited the female groups frequently both during and outside the mating period, and this social configuration has been referred to as a “super-group”. Narrow-striped Bokys appear to have a limited vocal repertoire. After birth, the young emit a shrill call that is very similar to a communication call between adult males and females, and can be transcribed as “bouk-bouk”. Almost certainly, the Malagasy name of this animal is the onomatopoeic form of this vocalization. The Narrow-striped Boky often erects its fluffy tail, which is undoubtedly for visual communication. Narrowstriped Boky has well-developed jaw, neck, and anal glands that it uses to mark vertcal vegetation, tree trunks, and the ground. This animal uses three different types of night shelters, depending on the season: partially collapsed and abandoned ant burrows during the dry, cold season; hollows in fallen dead trees at the beginning of the rainy, warm season; and cavities up to 10 m above the ground in standing dead or living trees during the rainy, warm season. Underground burrows are at least partially excavated, with a single tunnel entrance terminating as a chamber. This carnivore is known to share tree hollows with a variety of nocturnal lemurs, but the species are not in direct contact, as they occupy different portions of the cavity. Groups regularly move between different resting shelters, generally along the periphery of their home range, which may help to reduce ectoparasite loads.

Groups regularly move between different resting shelters, generally along the periphery of their home range, which may help to reduce ectoparasite loads. Narrow-striped Bokys are preyed upon by Fossa . Breeding. In the Kirindy ( CFPF ) Forest, mating takes place in August. In the early morning, soon after sunrise, the male arrives at the burrow entrance of the female and waits for her to exit. At the onset of each encounter, females are vocal and aggressive towards the males. These agonistic interactions decrease over the course of an hour, and eventually the male can mount the female. They then copulate up to three times, and in each case, the period of intromission decreases. Subsequently, the male leaves the group for several months. The alpha-female is apparently receptive before any other females of the same group. The gestation period is estimated to be between 90 and 105 days; however, a recent estimate of 74 days has been advanced. Females give birth to a single baby weighing about 50 g , and there appears to be some synchrony between females living in the same group. At birth, neonates already have their ears and eyes open; their fur coloration is slightly lighter than that of adults. The young appear to be particularly precocious, walking within a day of being born. The incisors erupt by four days, and they eat solid food within 15 days, although they continue to nurse for about two months. They are agile climbers by 45 days and are actively hunting within three months. Soon after birth, the young are placed in communal creche sites, with an opening small enough that adult Narrow-striped Boky cannot enter. The young exit the site and feed when they are called by their mothers; they nurse three times a day the first week after birth. In late afternoon, before sunset, mothers take their respective babies from the créche to a night shelter. Sexual maturity is apparently reached at two years of age.","Listed in The IUCN Red List as Vulnerable; however, the result of a Conservation Breeding Specialist Group workshop sponsored by the IUCN / SSC held in 2001 and attended by specialists working on Madagascar Carnivores gave the status of decemlineata as Threatened and that of lineata as Data Deficient. On the basis of a recent trapping survey of the central portion of the Menabe region, the local population is estimated to be 2000-3400 adults and that of the S Menabe region (to the northern bank of the Mangoky River) as 6400-8650 adults. In the central Menabe, the area of occupancy was estimated as 900 km * and the extent of occurrence as 1524 km ?. For the southern Menabe population, the figures are 1871 km ® and 8729 km ? respectively. No comparable information is available on the population of lineata occurring south of the Mangoky River. The factors limiting the distribution of this species are associated with forest cover, but at a series of sample sites, the abundance of decemlineata was not correlated with variables such as soil structure,litter depth, or invertebrate abundance. It has been proposed that building access roads for logging or other forms of exploitation greatly increases threats to this animal, including predation or harassment by dogs, and the destruction of the forest understory by domestic livestock. Further, in certain portions of this species’ range people hunt it for bush meat. The dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar are under the most severe human pressures of any natural forest formation on the island. The recently trapped M. d. lineata specimen was obtained in a region known as the Mikea Forest, spanning the zone from the Fiherenana River north to the Mangoky River. In this region there are several species of locally restricted endemic animals, including two recently described species of small mammals discovered during a 2003 expedition to the zone. The occurrence of M. d. lineata in this forest block helps to underscore the need to protectit. Initial steps have been taken to place a portion of the southern Mikea Forest, the zone between the Manombo and Fiherenana Rivers, into a conservation area.","Albignac (1971b, 1972, 1973, 1976, 1984) | Conservation Breeding Specialist Group ( SSC / IUCN) | (2002) | Goodman (2003a) | Goodman & Raselimanana (2003) | Goodman, Thomas & Kidney (2005) | Hawkins, A.FA. et al.

Narrow-striped Boky Mungotictis decemlineata French: Galidie a dix raies / German: Schmalstreifenmungo / Spanish: Galidia rayada Other common names: Narrow-striped Mongoose , Boky , Boky-boky Taxonomy. Galidia decemlineata Grandidier, 1867 , “a la cote ouest de Madagascar ”. The previous statement that the type locality is the “east coast of Madagascar ” is incorrect . An animal from the Toliara region was described as Galidictis vittata. This species was subsequently transferred to the genus Mungotictis by Pocock, which contained two species: M. vittatus, which was preoccupied by G. wvittata, and M. substriatus, which was renamed as M. lineatus. To further complicate the situation, Pocock was apparently unaware of the description of Galidia decemlineata, the senior synonym that replaced vittatus (sensu Gray, 1848). Finally, R . Albignac divided the species into two geographic forms, M. d. decemlineata and M. d. lineata, but the single specimen he referred to the latter form was actually of Grandidier’s Vontsira. The name M. d. lineata has been retained for the south-western population, which until 2005 was only known from a single specimen associated with M. lineatus. M. d. lineata is maintained here as a geographical form. Several measurement and pelage coloration characters separate this population from those occurring farther north. These differences may warrant the two geographical forms being recognized as full species; molecular studies should help to resolve this point. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. M. d. decemlineata Grandidier, 1867 — CW Madagascar (Menabe region). M. d. lineata Pocock, 1915 — SW Madagascar (S of the Mangoky River). The previous records ofthis form in the Lac Tsimanampetsotsa area are misidentified specimens of Grandidier’s Vontsira. Descriptive notes. Adults of the nominate form from the central Menabe region, M. d. decemlineata: head-body 26.4-29. 4 cm , tail 19.1-20. 9 cm , hindfoot 6.6-2 cm, ear 2-4— 2-5 cm; weight of adult males is 475-625 g, adult females is 450-740 g, and juveniles 350-490 g. No apparent sexual dimorphism in external measurements. Measurements of an adult female M. d. lineata include: head-body 33-5 cm,tail 21-5 cm, hindfoot 5-9 cm, ear 2-5 cm. The Narrow-striped Boky’s long, pointed snout, cylindrical body, short legs, and long bushy tail easily distinguish this relatively small animal from other Madagascar Carnivores. The dorsal pelage coloration of the nominate form is a grizzled gray mixed with light brown or beige and is characterized by eight to ten broadly-spaced, thin longitudinal stripes running from the nape to the base ofthe tail. The venter and legs are monochrome pale brownish-beige to pale orangish-brown. The ears are short and rounded. The light gray tail is without stripes or rings. There is webbing between the toes and the claws are long. Mungotictis d. lineata has a darker dorsum and the back stripes are darker and more distinct. They start as well-defined stripes higher on the nape andjust behind the ears. The venteris distinctly darker than the nominate form’s and approaches a russet color. Habitat. In the central and northern portions ofits distribution, the Narrow-striped Boky occurs at elevations from near sea level to 400 m in dry deciduous forests on sandy substrate. Baobab trees are often the dominant vegetation. These forested zones tend to have relatively intact habitat, with a dense understory and notably homogenous vegetational structure and floristic composition. The Tsiribihina River formsits northern distributional limit. This species tends to be distinctly more common in the larger areas of native forest and is uncommon, absent or extirpated from smaller and degraded forest blocks. In 2004, an individual referable to M. d. lineata was captured on the southern bank of the Manombo River at approximately 400 m above sea level and in dry deciduous forest. On both banks of the river, thin alluvial soils support a 25-50 m wide band of disturbed gallery forest immediately adjacent to the flood plain. Beyond this, the gallery forest gives way to dry deciduous forest, with a taller canopy layer. Food and Feeding. Narrow-striped Boky is primarily insectivorous. In one study 69 of 71 scats contained insects. Particularly during the extended dry-cold season, it feeds largely on insect larvae, which are extracted by digging them out from soil or rotten wood. This speciesis also known to feed on a variety of vertebrates, including reptiles, birds, and small mammals (tenrecs, shrew-tenrecs, native rodents, and lemurs), as well as other invertebrates such as snails. Scat analyses found a variety of primate remains, including Gray Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus), Lesser Dwarf Lemur, Giant Mouse Lemur (Mirza coquereli), and Red-tailed Sportive Lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), of which the Red-tailed Sportive Lemur, weighing close to 850 g , is the largest and was probably scavenged. Remains of the rodent Votsovotsa, which can weigh over 1 kg ,also were found and presumably were also the result of scavenging. There are records of this species cooperatively hunting prey such as mouse-lemurs, adults of which weigh more than 50 g . Based on local folklore, Narrow-striped Boky is reputed to feed on large boas and regularly on wild honey. There is no evidence of extensive fat storage before the onset of the dry season. Activity patterns. Narrow-striped Boky is largely diurnal, but on occasion can be active at night. This speciesis considered scansorial; it mainly moves on the ground but can climb and descend trees, including vertical surfaces. It has been reported to swim, but no recent confirmation of this behavioris available. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Earlier studies, largely of Narrowstriped Boky in captivity, concluded that they were not particularly social but tend to live in couples. Recent research in the wild indicates that they are notably gregarious and have a complex social system with some particularly interesting intricacies. In a telemetry study conducted in the Kirindy forest Centre de Formation Professionnelle Forestiére by L.. Razafimanantsoa, 26 animals ( 20 adults and six sub-adults) were captured and marked in an area of about 90 ha. These animals belonged to different groups and included dispersing solitary individuals. A good proportion of the marked animals were not seen again in the study area, which was occupied by two different groups. The first group was composed of two adult females, an adult male, a sub-adult female, and one of the previous season’s young; the second group was two adult females and a sub-adult male. The home range ofthe first group was calculated as about 18 ha and the second group 13 ha. These figures are notably smaller than previous inferred estimates of 20-25 ha. The ranges of the two groups overlapped over an area of about 1-5 ha. In the overlap zone, group members intensively scent-marked using glandular secretions and no aggressive interactions were observed between them. Based on these radio-tracking studies, individual Narrow-striped Boky can traverse a distance of 2200 m in a single day, of which two-thirds is covered during the morning. This species often can be observed in groups with three to five adults , and depending on the season, with numerous sub-adults. Groups of more than ten individuals have been observed and, in certain areas, the age and sex ratio remains stable over the course of years. As a group moves through the forest, the alpha female plays the role of “leader”. After mating, the males will generally leave the female group for several months. Lone individuals can be observed, particularly towards the end of the dry season, and these are presumed to be solitary males. During the mating period, males were tolerant of visiting males and even allowed them to copulate with group females. Some marked males visited the female groups frequently both during and outside the mating period, and this social configuration has been referred to as a “super-group”. Narrow-striped Bokys appear to have a limited vocal repertoire. After birth, the young emit a shrill call that is very similar to a communication call between adult males and females, and can be transcribed as “bouk-bouk”. Almost certainly, the Malagasy name of this animal is the onomatopoeic form of this vocalization. The Narrow-striped Boky often erects its fluffy tail, which is undoubtedly for visual communication. Narrowstriped Boky has well-developed jaw, neck, and anal glands that it uses to mark vertcal vegetation, tree trunks, and the ground. This animal uses three different types of night shelters, depending on the season: partially collapsed and abandoned ant burrows during the dry, cold season; hollows in fallen dead trees at the beginning of the rainy, warm season; and cavities up to 10 m above the ground in standing dead or living trees during the rainy, warm season. Underground burrows are at least partially excavated, with a single tunnel entrance terminating as a chamber. This carnivore is known to share tree hollows with a variety of nocturnal lemurs, but the species are not in direct contact, as they occupy different portions of the cavity. Groups regularly move between different resting shelters, generally along the periphery of their home range, which may help to reduce ectoparasite loads. Narrow-striped Bokys are preyed upon by Fossa . Breeding. In the Kirindy ( CFPF ) Forest, mating takes place in August. In the early morning, soon after sunrise, the male arrives at the burrow entrance of the female and waits for her to exit. At the onset of each encounter, females are vocal and aggressive towards the males. These agonistic interactions decrease over the course of an hour, and eventually the male can mount the female. They then copulate up to three times, and in each case, the period of intromission decreases. Subsequently, the male leaves the group for several months. The alpha-female is apparently receptive before any other females of the same group. The gestation period is estimated to be between 90 and 105 days; however, a recent estimate of 74 days has been advanced. Females give birth to a single baby weighing about 50 g , and there appears to be some synchrony between females living in the same group. At birth, neonates already have their ears and eyes open; their fur coloration is slightly lighter than that of adults. The young appear to be particularly precocious, walking within a day of being born. The incisors erupt by four days, and they eat solid food within 15 days, although they continue to nurse for about two months. They are agile climbers by 45 days and are actively hunting within three months. Soon after birth, the young are placed in communal creche sites, with an opening small enough that adult Narrow-striped Boky cannot enter. The young exit the site and feed when they are called by their mothers; they nurse three times a day the first week after birth. In late afternoon, before sunset, mothers take their respective babies from the créche to a night shelter. Sexual maturity is apparently reached at two years of age. Status and Conservation. Listed in The IUCN Red List as Vulnerable; however, the result of a Conservation Breeding Specialist Group workshop sponsored by the IUCN / SSC held in 2001 and attended by specialists working on Madagascar Carnivores gave the status of decemlineata as Threatened and that of lineata as Data Deficient. On the basis of a recent trapping survey of the central portion of the Menabe region, the local population is estimated to be 2000-3400 adults and that of the S Menabe region (to the northern bank of the Mangoky River) as 6400-8650 adults. In the central Menabe, the area of occupancy was estimated as 900 km * and the extent of occurrence as 1524 km ?. For the southern Menabe population, the figures are 1871 km ® and 8729 km ? respectively. No comparable information is available on the population of lineata occurring south of the Mangoky River. The factors limiting the distribution of this species are associated with forest cover, but at a series of sample sites, the abundance of decemlineata was not correlated with variables such as soil structure,litter depth, or invertebrate abundance. It has been proposed that building access roads for logging or other forms of exploitation greatly increases threats to this animal, including predation or harassment by dogs, and the destruction of the forest understory by domestic livestock. Further, in certain portions of this species’ range people hunt it for bush meat. The dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar are under the most severe human pressures of any natural forest formation on the island. The recently trapped M. d. lineata specimen was obtained in a region known as the Mikea Forest, spanning the zone from the Fiherenana River north to the Mangoky River. In this region there are several species of locally restricted endemic animals, including two recently described species of small mammals discovered during a 2003 expedition to the zone. The occurrence of M. d. lineata in this forest block helps to underscore the need to protectit. Initial steps have been taken to place a portion of the southern Mikea Forest, the zone between the Manombo and Fiherenana Rivers, into a conservation area. Bibliography.

A small terrestrial civet, with no erectile dorsal crest, a short muzzle, and ears set close on the forehead. The coat color is gray, tawny, or brown. The body is covered by small brown or black spots on the flanks, which tend to run as three to five longitudinal lines on the back. This pattern of lines and spots is variable and does not seem to be correlated with geographic origin. The black and white neck-stripes are narrower and more variable than in the Viverra civets. There are white patches on both sides of the muzzle and white spots between the eyes, but these are not clearly defined. The tail has six to nine dark rings and a white tip. The feet are dark brown or black and have five digits; however, the hallux and pollex are reduced and elevated. The metacarpal pads are reduced to one small lobe and the metatarsal pads are absent. The perineal gland is larger in males. This gland opens into specialized pouches; the inner pockets are enclosed by antero-posteriorly elongated lips (these are everted when the gland secretion is applied). There are at least two pairs ofteats. The skull is low and elongated, with well-developed post-orbital processes. The posterior chamber of the auditory bullae is well-developed. Dental formula: 13/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The first upper premolars are reduced and the lower premolars have well-developed cusps. The largest teeth are the carnassials.","Semi-evergreen and deciduous forest, mixed deciduous forest, bamboo forest, scrubby areas, grasslands, and riverine habitat. Also found near plantations and human settlements. Reported up to 1200 m in north-east India . In Thailand , a radio-collared male moved in an area consisting of 62% dry deciduous forest, 25% dry evergreen forest, and 13% mixed deciduous forest. In Thailand , out of 29 individuals live-trapped, 16 captures were in open shrub habitat, ten were semi-evergreen/mixed deciduous forest, and four were in grassland; camera-trapping produced 14 photographs, with 13 photos from semi-evergreen/mixed deciduous forest, and one from open shrub habitat. In India (Western Ghats), Small Indian Civets were found to be more abundant in rainforest fragments than in relatively undisturbed large tracts of rainforest.","Omnivorous; feeds largely on small vertebrates and invertebrates (particularly insects). In China , the most common prey was rodents (80%) and insects (23%). In southeastern China , the frequency of occurrence of food items in 44 scats was 89% rodents, 39% insects, 21% birds, 14% fruit, 9% leaves, 5% shrews, 5% acorns, 2% crustaceans, and 2% paddy rice. In Taiwan , the percentage of occurrence was 95% insects, 67% earthworms, 58% plants, 40% mammals, 16% amphibians, and 11% reptiles; the occurrence of birds, fish, crustaceans, chilopods, gastropods, and arachnids, were all less than 10%. There was some variation in the diet due to seasonal availability; insects were consumed more in the summer and less in the winter, and plants were consumed more in the spring and summer. The contents of seven stomachs from India comprised rats, babblers, frogs, scorpions, crabs, crickets, centipedes, millipedes, beetles, seeds, berries (Zizyphus oenoplia and Aporusa lindleyana), pineapple, and grass. The stomachs of Small Indian Civets captured near human habitations contained boiled rice and fish bones. The heads of vertebrates are chewed and other parts of the body are merely crushed. Activity patterns. Nocturnal: activity during the night has been recorded by cameratraps, field sightings, and radio-telemetry. In Thailand , a radio-collared male was active over 50% of the time between 16:30 h and 04:30 h, with a peak of activity between 19:30 h and 01:30 h. The highest monthly activity level was in the rainy month of February. In Myanmar , two Small Indian Civets showed peak activity from 19:30-22:00 h, and from 00:30-03:00 h. In southeastern China , two males were active over 50% of the time between 18:00 h and 05:00 h. In Thailand , rest sites were located in trees and on the ground, all in mixed deciduous forest. In southeastern China , daybeds were on the ground, under bushes or among tall grass, and were often adjacent to each other. They were used once (43%) or twice (29%), but four were used 6-10 times each. In Myanmar , Small Indian Civets rested on the ground, within dense shrub cover, or less often, in a hole in the ground; 60% ofthe sites were used only once, although one was re-used 15 times over a period of 250 days. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, single individuals have been observed in the field and recorded by camera-traps. Terrestrial, but is said to climb well. In southeastern China , the resting home range of a male was 2-3 km*. The mean distance moved between consecutively used daybeds was 613 m . In Thailand , the home range of a male was 3-1 km?®; his core home range was 1-1 km?and the mean daily movement was 500 m . In India (Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve), the home range of a male was 2-2 km? the distance between successive daytime locations ranged from 193 m in September to 2260 m in October. In Myanmar , the mean distance moved between consecutive resting sites was 214 m . Scent marking activity, using the secretions from the perineal gland, occurs in both sexes, but is more frequent in males. They mark any object, but vertical objects seem to be preferred. Scent marking varies between days and season. In captivity, it occurs mainly at night, with three peaks at 18:00-19:00 h, 21:00-23:00 h, and before dawn. Scent marking is more common in the spring, during the breeding season. Vocal communication in captive civets includes: a scream (given by the female during fights with a male); threat calling (given under stress and when an animal is terrified); courtship calling, “da da da” (given by the male as an estrus female approaches).",,"Nocturnal: activity during the night has been recorded by cameratraps, field sightings, and radio-telemetry.

Vocal communication in captive civets includes: a scream (given by the female during fights with a male); threat calling (given under stress and when an animal is terrified); courtship calling, “da da da” (given by the male as an estrus female approaches). Breeding. In China , captive Small Indian Civets had two breeding periods. Breeding occurred mostly between February and April; and less frequently in August and September. In southern India , breeding in captive civets occurred during March to May and October to December. When the female is in estrus, both the male and female increase scent marking, inter-individual contacts, and locomotor activity (which is highest between 20:00 h and 21:00 h). Scent marking increases in the male first and then in the female, with a peak during estrus; it decreases after copulations. The male also sniffs the posterior quarters of a female in estrus. Courtship commences with a series of “duk-duk-duk” calls from the male. During the first mounting attempts, the female responds with a sharp scream and bites the male. This often ends in a fight, in which both animals can be injured on the nape and tail. Courtship calls resume after 5-30 minutes. After three or four such attempts, the female runs around the cage, often touching and slightly pushing the male. The male follows and sniffs at the perineal region of the female and finally she lies down, allowing the male to mount; the body of the female is fully extended, with the hindlegs slightly raised. The male mounts with the forepaws placed on either side of the female’s shoulders. He grips the hair on her nape and begins pelvic thrusts. After some time, the female makes a low cat-like call and the male then dismounts. Immediately after dismounting, the female growls and tries to bite the male; they then go to separate corners of the cage. During the first ten days after copulation, females are less active than before, but their appetite increases. Scent marking decreases to a base level and stops around 20 days after a successful mating. Females do not resume scent marking until two months after the parturition date. Movements of the fetuses within a pregnant female are noticeable from the sixth week of pregnancy. Females do not eat on the day of parturition. The mean gestation period is 67 + 2 days. Thelitter size varies from two to five, with two being the most common. The mother nurses the young three to four times every hour during the first week after parturition, but this decreases to once every hour by the second week, to once every two hours by the third week, and to two to three times a day by the seventh week. The mother licks the whole body of her offspring and eats their excreta. If alarmed, she will hold a kitten in her mouth, gripping the fur on its nape. At birth, the newborn civets are blind and covered with fur; their weight ranges from 90 to 110 g . They immediately cluster beside the belly of the mother and crawl to reach a teat. Their eyes open on the fifth day and from the eighth day onwards they can walk slowly. They start eating solid food by four weeks of age. Scent marking behavioris first observed when they are eight weeks old, but perineal gland secretions are not noted until they are eight months old. The body weight is 180-200 g by the end of the second week, 250-300 g by the end of the fourth, 400-500 g by the end of the eighth week, and 1 kg by ten weeks. They reach adult size at six months of age.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Small Indian Civet is considered unthreatened due to its widespread distribution and generalist habitat and food preferences. However, it is not fully understood how habitat disturbance may affect this species, and more ecological studies are needed. Small Indian Civets are hunted for their meat and scent, and are particularly vulnerable to snare trapping. They are also farmed in India to extract their perineal gland secretion for medicinal purposes. These farmed civets are not captive-bred, but are trapped in the wild, and this could be causing declines in local populations. Field surveys are needed to monitor populations, especially in areas where their numbers may be depressed due to high trapping pressures.","Austin & Tewes (1999b) | Ayyadurai et al.

It has been introduced to Madagascar , Zanzibar Island , the Comoro Islands , and Socotra Island for the production of civet or to be used as rat catchers; its presence on some of the Indonesian islands (Bali, Bawean, Kangean, Lombok, and Sumbawa) could also have resulted from introductions. Descriptive notes. Head-body 48.5-68 cm, tail 30-43 cm, hindfoot 8:5-10 cm, ear 3.9-5 cm; weight 2—4 kg . A small terrestrial civet, with no erectile dorsal crest, a short muzzle, and ears set close on the forehead. The coat color is gray, tawny, or brown. The body is covered by small brown or black spots on the flanks, which tend to run as three to five longitudinal lines on the back. This pattern of lines and spots is variable and does not seem to be correlated with geographic origin. The black and white neck-stripes are narrower and more variable than in the Viverra civets. There are white patches on both sides of the muzzle and white spots between the eyes, but these are not clearly defined. The tail has six to nine dark rings and a white tip. The feet are dark brown or black and have five digits; however, the hallux and pollex are reduced and elevated. The metacarpal pads are reduced to one small lobe and the metatarsal pads are absent. The perineal gland is larger in males. This gland opens into specialized pouches; the inner pockets are enclosed by antero-posteriorly elongated lips (these are everted when the gland secretion is applied). There are at least two pairs ofteats. The skull is low and elongated, with well-developed post-orbital processes. The posterior chamber of the auditory bullae is well-developed. Dental formula: 13/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The first upper premolars are reduced and the lower premolars have well-developed cusps. The largest teeth are the carnassials. Habitat. Semi-evergreen and deciduous forest, mixed deciduous forest, bamboo forest, scrubby areas, grasslands, and riverine habitat. Also found near plantations and human settlements. Reported up to 1200 m in north-east India . In Thailand , a radio-collared male moved in an area consisting of 62% dry deciduous forest, 25% dry evergreen forest, and 13% mixed deciduous forest. In Thailand , out of 29 individuals live-trapped, 16 captures were in open shrub habitat, ten were semi-evergreen/mixed deciduous forest, and four were in grassland; camera-trapping produced 14 photographs, with 13 photos from semi-evergreen/mixed deciduous forest, and one from open shrub habitat. In India (Western Ghats), Small Indian Civets were found to be more abundant in rainforest fragments than in relatively undisturbed large tracts of rainforest. Food and Feeding. Omnivorous; feeds largely on small vertebrates and invertebrates (particularly insects). In China , the most common prey was rodents (80%) and insects (23%). In southeastern China , the frequency of occurrence of food items in 44 scats was 89% rodents, 39% insects, 21% birds, 14% fruit, 9% leaves, 5% shrews, 5% acorns, 2% crustaceans, and 2% paddy rice. In Taiwan , the percentage of occurrence was 95% insects, 67% earthworms, 58% plants, 40% mammals, 16% amphibians, and 11% reptiles; the occurrence of birds, fish, crustaceans, chilopods, gastropods, and arachnids, were all less than 10%. There was some variation in the diet due to seasonal availability; insects were consumed more in the summer and less in the winter, and plants were consumed more in the spring and summer. The contents of seven stomachs from India comprised rats, babblers, frogs, scorpions, crabs, crickets, centipedes, millipedes, beetles, seeds, berries (Zizyphus oenoplia and Aporusa lindleyana), pineapple, and grass. The stomachs of Small Indian Civets captured near human habitations contained boiled rice and fish bones. The heads of vertebrates are chewed and other parts of the body are merely crushed. Activity patterns. Nocturnal: activity during the night has been recorded by cameratraps, field sightings, and radio-telemetry. In Thailand , a radio-collared male was active over 50% of the time between 16:30 h and 04:30 h, with a peak of activity between 19:30 h and 01:30 h. The highest monthly activity level was in the rainy month of February. In Myanmar , two Small Indian Civets showed peak activity from 19:30-22:00 h, and from 00:30-03:00 h. In southeastern China , two males were active over 50% of the time between 18:00 h and 05:00 h. In Thailand , rest sites were located in trees and on the ground, all in mixed deciduous forest. In southeastern China , daybeds were on the ground, under bushes or among tall grass, and were often adjacent to each other. They were used once (43%) or twice (29%), but four were used 6-10 times each. In Myanmar , Small Indian Civets rested on the ground, within dense shrub cover, or less often, in a hole in the ground; 60% ofthe sites were used only once, although one was re-used 15 times over a period of 250 days. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, single individuals have been observed in the field and recorded by camera-traps. Terrestrial, but is said to climb well. In southeastern China , the resting home range of a male was 2-3 km*. The mean distance moved between consecutively used daybeds was 613 m . In Thailand , the home range of a male was 3-1 km?®; his core home range was 1-1 km?and the mean daily movement was 500 m . In India (Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve), the home range of a male was 2-2 km? the distance between successive daytime locations ranged from 193 m in September to 2260 m in October. In Myanmar , the mean distance moved between consecutive resting sites was 214 m . Scent marking activity, using the secretions from the perineal gland, occurs in both sexes, but is more frequent in males. They mark any object, but vertical objects seem to be preferred. Scent marking varies between days and season. In captivity, it occurs mainly at night, with three peaks at 18:00-19:00 h, 21:00-23:00 h, and before dawn. Scent marking is more common in the spring, during the breeding season. Vocal communication in captive civets includes: a scream (given by the female during fights with a male); threat calling (given under stress and when an animal is terrified); courtship calling, “da da da” (given by the male as an estrus female approaches). Breeding. In China , captive Small Indian Civets had two breeding periods. Breeding occurred mostly between February and April; and less frequently in August and September. In southern India , breeding in captive civets occurred during March to May and October to December. When the female is in estrus, both the male and female increase scent marking, inter-individual contacts, and locomotor activity (which is highest between 20:00 h and 21:00 h). Scent marking increases in the male first and then in the female, with a peak during estrus; it decreases after copulations. The male also sniffs the posterior quarters of a female in estrus. Courtship commences with a series of “duk-duk-duk” calls from the male. During the first mounting attempts, the female responds with a sharp scream and bites the male. This often ends in a fight, in which both animals can be injured on the nape and tail. Courtship calls resume after 5-30 minutes. After three or four such attempts, the female runs around the cage, often touching and slightly pushing the male. The male follows and sniffs at the perineal region of the female and finally she lies down, allowing the male to mount; the body of the female is fully extended, with the hindlegs slightly raised. The male mounts with the forepaws placed on either side of the female’s shoulders. He grips the hair on her nape and begins pelvic thrusts. After some time, the female makes a low cat-like call and the male then dismounts. Immediately after dismounting, the female growls and tries to bite the male; they then go to separate corners of the cage. During the first ten days after copulation, females are less active than before, but their appetite increases. Scent marking decreases to a base level and stops around 20 days after a successful mating. Females do not resume scent marking until two months after the parturition date. Movements of the fetuses within a pregnant female are noticeable from the sixth week of pregnancy. Females do not eat on the day of parturition. The mean gestation period is 67 + 2 days. Thelitter size varies from two to five, with two being the most common. The mother nurses the young three to four times every hour during the first week after parturition, but this decreases to once every hour by the second week, to once every two hours by the third week, and to two to three times a day by the seventh week. The mother licks the whole body of her offspring and eats their excreta. If alarmed, she will hold a kitten in her mouth, gripping the fur on its nape. At birth, the newborn civets are blind and covered with fur; their weight ranges from 90 to 110 g . They immediately cluster beside the belly of the mother and crawl to reach a teat. Their eyes open on the fifth day and from the eighth day onwards they can walk slowly. They start eating solid food by four weeks of age. Scent marking behavioris first observed when they are eight weeks old, but perineal gland secretions are not noted until they are eight months old. The body weight is 180-200 g by the end of the second week, 250-300 g by the end of the fourth, 400-500 g by the end of the eighth week, and 1 kg by ten weeks. They reach adult size at six months of age. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Small Indian Civet is considered unthreatened due to its widespread distribution and generalist habitat and food preferences. However, it is not fully understood how habitat disturbance may affect this species, and more ecological studies are needed. Small Indian Civets are hunted for their meat and scent, and are particularly vulnerable to snare trapping. They are also farmed in India to extract their perineal gland secretion for medicinal purposes. These farmed civets are not captive-bred, but are trapped in the wild, and this could be causing declines in local populations. Field surveys are needed to monitor populations, especially in areas where their numbers may be depressed due to high trapping pressures. Bibliography. Austin & Tewes (1999b), Ayyadurai et al.

In South Africa , females are larger and heavier than males, but there is a large overlap. A large terrestrial civet, with large hindquarters and an erectile dorsal crest. The pelage is coarse, with long thick guard hairs. The coat color varies from white to yellow to reddish-buff. The body spots are brown to black and are arranged in irregular lines along the body. Melanistic individuals have been reported from some areas, including up to one third of the population in the Congo Basin. The head is broad, with a pointed muzzle and small rounded ears. There is a black band across the face and white patches between the eyes and ears and on the sides of the muzzle. The forehead is whitish or grayish; the ears are white at the front and black at the back, with a white tip. The neck has conspicuous large black and white bands. The hairs along the dorsal crest increase in length from the forehead and reach their maximum on the posterior back, where the maximum length reaches 10-12 cm. The tail is dark on the dorsal surface and marked with five diffuse white rings; the tip is broadly black. There are five digits on each foot, although the hallux and pollex are set back and do not appear in prints. The claws are long and curved, and slightly retractile. The metacarpal and metatarsal pads are reduced and fused, and form a small rounded bi-lobed pad. The perineal gland is well-developed, forming a doublepocketed invagination. This gland is visible externally as paired swellings (each about 30 mm long and 19 mm wide), with an oblong opening about 25 mm long that is kept closed by a pair of labia (which are everted when the secretion is applied). Inside each gland there is a large hair-lined sac; the secretion from the glands enters a space that functions as a storage reservoir. Up to 15 g of civet oil can be extracted each week from captive animals. Anal glands are present, but are simple; they are situated in the wall of the rectum and open directly into the rectum. There are two pairs of teats. The skull is heavily built with developed crests, especially in males. The auditory bullae are large and oval, with the posterior chamber rounded and swollen. The paroccipital process is well-developed and extends beyond the bullae ventrally. The post-orbital constriction is not well marked and the post-orbital processes are short and blunt. Dental formula: I 3/3,C1/1,P4/4,M 2/2 = 40. The canines are short and heavily built. The carnassials and post-carnassial teeth are well-developed; the molars are blunt and broad, adapted for crushing.","Forest and open habitats (particularly with dense ground cover). Often associated with riverine habitat in drier regions and sometimes found in plantations and near human settlements. Found up to 1700 m . In Ethiopia , a radio-tracked male used Hagenia and Juniper forests (62% of the time), bush (19%), grassland (11%), and farmland (8%).","Omnivorous: invertebrates, fruits, small vertebrates, eggs, and grass. In Zimbabwe , an examination of 27 stomachs revealed that during the warm, wet summer months (October to April), 70% contained insects, (predominantly grasshoppers and beetles), followed by 40% fruits, 30% rodents ( Muridae , mainly multimammate mice Mastomys spp. , and the Angoni Vlei Rat, Otomys angoniensis), 30% reptiles, 20% amphibians, 20% myriapodes, 20% grass, and 10% birds. In the colder, dryer months (May to September), the highest percentage of occurrence was 57% fruits, followed by 43% insects, 43% Muridae , 21% birds, 21% grass, 14% reptiles, and 7% amphibians. Animal prey also included Scrub Hare (Lepus saxatilis), Banded Mongoose, Common Slender Mongoose, Smith’s Bush Squirrel (Paraxerus cepapr), South African Spring Hare (Pedetes capensis), and helmeted guineatowl (Numida meleagris). Carrion of Impala (Aepyceros melampus), Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), Bushbuck (7: scriptus), and Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) was also eaten. A similar diet has been reported in West and East Africa, but aquatic organisms (crabs, snails, and mudskippers) were also eaten. In Nigeria , stomach contents contained rodents, reptiles, insects, birds, amphibians, gastropods, and plants. In the Central African Republic , the frequency of occurrence in scats was 97% arthropods, 73% fruits, 30% rodents, 3% reptiles, and 3% birds. In Zaire, scats contained eleven fruit species ( Arecaceae , Burseraceae , Moraceae , Myristicaceae , and Sapindaceae ); seasonal variations were observed and a wider diversity of fruits was consumed during the rainy season. A civet feeding on a fruiting tree immediately exploited a nearby outbreak of millipedes. Their behavior in captivity suggests that they detect their prey mainly by scent and sound, rather than vision. Animal prey is seized by the mouth, the paws are not usually used in the capture and the killing bite is often directed at the head. Various methods have been observed when attacking live prey: run-away bite (a quick nip aimed at any part of the prey’s body, followed by instant release and retreat); bite-and-throw (the prey is held long enough to be thrown quickly aside with a quick movement of the head); bite-and-shake (the grip is retained and the prey is shaken to break the vertebrae); killing bite (the jaws bite home firmly). Activity patterns. Predominantly nocturnal, with peaks in activity one to two hours before sunset until midnight, and around sunrise. Occasionally seen in the morning or afternoon on overcast days. In Ethiopia , diurnal rest sites were in dense vegetation on the ground, mostly in an area of dense Juniper forest (nine out of eleven sites). In Zaire, African Civets selected dens close to fruit-bearing trees and moved away when the fruiting season was over. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although groups consisting of an adult and young have been observed. Terrestrial; they are poor climbers, but are known to clamber along low stout branches to get at ripening fruit. In Ethiopia , a radio-collared sub-adult male had a home range of 11-1 km? the core area was 0-4 km?, centered on Hagenia and Juniper forests. On one occasion, this male was found within 20 meters of a White-tailed Mongoose. African Civets deposit their feces in latrines (civetries); these are usually located along game trails and in clearings and may play a role in marking territories. Some are used frequently and then abandoned for periods of several months. They tend to use the same sites, even when the accumulation of scats is removed. In Zimbabwe , latrines were found in Asparagus thickets, in grassland, and in the cover of dense reed beds. In Zaire, four latrines were separated by several kilometres; each one was used by a single civet. These latrines were in natural hollows in the ground left by uprooted trees (35-65 cm deep and 60-170 cm wide), and all were close to a river (8-30 m). Urine may also play a role in scent marking: captive males have been observed to sniff a female’s urine, which prompted them to flehm. African Civets scent-mark objects with their perineal gland secretion (called civet), both on the ground and on vertical surfaces. In South Africa , they were found to mark trees (50%), rocks (29%), shrubs (19%), and herbs (10%); the mean height of marks above ground was 35 cm . They mark trees and shrubs that bear fruits eaten by them and also at or nearcivetries. Scent marks retain a strong musk odor for one month and are still detectable after four months. To mark a tree, the civet backs up, raises its tail, and presses the everted perineal gland against the trunk. Both sexes scent-mark, but males do it more frequently than females (the perineal gland is larger in the male). Captive females mark horizontal surfaces more than vertical ones; the opposite is true for males. Young animals scent-mark only in the squatting posture, whereas adults only perform the backing-up technique. African Civets do not emit perineal civet when alarmed, but they do sometimes mark when anxious or feeling insecure. Their senses of smell and hearing are acute (particularly for high pitched sounds). When at ease and alert, they move with the head held higher than the shoulder and the legs well extended. When anxious or in fear, they lower their head and flex the legs; the whole body sags, the eyes are narrowed, and the erectile crest is depressed. In a defensive threat, the dorsal crest is erected, the head is directed toward the source of alarm, and the body is turned sideways so that the change in size is visible to the opponent. An appeasement posture has been observed in captive civets and consists of lying down on one side. Although generally silent, several distinct vocalizations have been detected in captive animals: growl (frequently emitted by a female in defense of her kittens); cough-spit (when a terrified civet is approached); and scream (heard during serious fights). There are three different types of meow: a distress meow from kittens; a cat-like meow (made by the female during copulation); and the female sex call (emitted by the female before and during estrus). The most frequent vocalization is the contact call: a short sound, usually repeated three or four times, and sounds like “ha-ha-ha” emitted with the mouth closed.",,"Predominantly nocturnal, with peaks in activity one to two hours before sunset until midnight, and around sunrise.

The most frequent vocalization is the contact call: a short sound, usually repeated three or four times, and sounds like “ha-ha-ha” emitted with the mouth closed. Breeding. Breeding seems to occur throughout the year in West Africa, but there may be favored breeding seasons in East Africa (March to October) and southern Africa (August to January). Sexual maturity is attained at around twelve months. Females are polyoestrous and can have two or three litters a year; the estrus period appears to last up to six days. Natal den sites are in holes made by other animals or in cavities under tangled roots. Breeding behavior has been observed in captivity. As the female comes into estrus, the male and female became more aggressive, the male gives more contact calls, and both sexes increase their locomotor activity. The male makes several mounting attempts before the female accepts him; she will often move away and sometimes turn to snap at the male. When the female is receptive, she shows this by breaking into a run and inciting the male to pursue her. After several unsuccessful mounting attempts, the female finally lies down (with her hindquarters slightly raised) and permits the male to mount. The male places his forelegs on both sides of the female’s shoulders and makes treading movements with his hindlegs on each side of her flanks. Pelvic thrusting then takes place, during which the male bites the female’s fur between the shoulders. During copulation, the female gives a long meow; the male dismounts after forty seconds. After copulating, each civetlicks its genitals. Copulations take place at night. Gestation is 60 to 81 days. Litter size in captivity ranges from one to four. The young are born with short dark soft fur; the neck stripe is present, but is pale grayish and less conspicuous than in the adult. The facial pattern is indistinct, but the white muzzle marks are present. The perineal gland in the young is genet-like; the pouch is marked by an area of pale hairs, in the center of which the naked lips of the gland are visible. In female young, there is a patch of naked skin around the anus and a hairless isthmus links the lips of the gland. At one month old, the dark hairlines that traverse the adult pocket start to appear. Growth of the pocket conceals the naked lips, which are then only visible when everted. The eyes are open at birth or within the first few days. Newborns can crawl at birth; at five days they can stand on their hindlegs. They start to play at 14 days and to explore outside the den at 17-18 days. The motherlicks her young all over, with special attention to the perineal region, and consumes the urine and feces voided in response to this stimulation. The young are not given the opportunity to urinate independently before they are 25 days old. They are dependant on the mother’s milk for up to six weeks; they usually suckle from the posterior teats and it seems that each young always uses the same one. They start eating solid food in their second month and weaning occurs at around 14 to 16 weeks. In the second month, the young begin to catch insects and at 42 days the mother provides solid food. Mouth suckling (the young lick their mother’s mouth) is exhibited immediately before the mother begins to provide solid food. Weights of young are: 162 g at six days; 440-540 g at 17 days; 480-550 g at 21 days; and 680-810 g at 33 days. During the fifth month, the young begin to mark vertical objects with the backing-up technique, the perineal gland secretion becomes strongly scented, and males first flehm in response to female urine.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Considered common and widespread, and is not thought to be threatened. However, some local populations could be threatened by hunting and civet farming. African Civets are hunted and sold in markets for bushmeat and for their skins. They are also kept on farms in Ethiopia for the purpose of extracting their perineal secretions for the perfume industry. Although exact numbers are not known, one estimate is that there are 180 civet farmers holding over 2700 African Civets. They are not bred on these farms and to replenish those that die, new animals are taken from the wild. There is still not much known about this species acrossits range and field studies are needed.","Admasu et al. (2004b) | Angelici (2000) | Angelici, Luiselli, Politano & Akani (1999) | Colyn et al.

Head-body 67-84 cm, tail 34-46. 9 cm , hindfoot 12:3-13. 9 cm , ear 5.4-5. 8 cm ; weight 7-20 kg. In South Africa , females are larger and heavier than males, but there is a large overlap. A large terrestrial civet, with large hindquarters and an erectile dorsal crest. The pelage is coarse, with long thick guard hairs. The coat color varies from white to yellow to reddish-buff. The body spots are brown to black and are arranged in irregular lines along the body. Melanistic individuals have been reported from some areas, including up to one third of the population in the Congo Basin. The head is broad, with a pointed muzzle and small rounded ears. There is a black band across the face and white patches between the eyes and ears and on the sides of the muzzle. The forehead is whitish or grayish; the ears are white at the front and black at the back, with a white tip. The neck has conspicuous large black and white bands. The hairs along the dorsal crest increase in length from the forehead and reach their maximum on the posterior back, where the maximum length reaches 10-12 cm. The tail is dark on the dorsal surface and marked with five diffuse white rings; the tip is broadly black. There are five digits on each foot, although the hallux and pollex are set back and do not appear in prints. The claws are long and curved, and slightly retractile. The metacarpal and metatarsal pads are reduced and fused, and form a small rounded bi-lobed pad. The perineal gland is well-developed, forming a doublepocketed invagination. This gland is visible externally as paired swellings (each about 30 mm long and 19 mm wide), with an oblong opening about 25 mm long that is kept closed by a pair of labia (which are everted when the secretion is applied). Inside each gland there is a large hair-lined sac; the secretion from the glands enters a space that functions as a storage reservoir. Up to 15 g of civet oil can be extracted each week from captive animals. Anal glands are present, but are simple; they are situated in the wall of the rectum and open directly into the rectum. There are two pairs of teats. The skull is heavily built with developed crests, especially in males. The auditory bullae are large and oval, with the posterior chamber rounded and swollen. The paroccipital process is well-developed and extends beyond the bullae ventrally. The post-orbital constriction is not well marked and the post-orbital processes are short and blunt. Dental formula: I 3/3,C1/1,P4/4,M 2/2 = 40. The canines are short and heavily built. The carnassials and post-carnassial teeth are well-developed; the molars are blunt and broad, adapted for crushing. Habitat. Forest and open habitats (particularly with dense ground cover). Often associated with riverine habitat in drier regions and sometimes found in plantations and near human settlements. Found up to 1700 m . In Ethiopia , a radio-tracked male used Hagenia and Juniper forests (62% of the time), bush (19%), grassland (11%), and farmland (8%). Food and Feeding. Omnivorous: invertebrates, fruits, small vertebrates, eggs, and grass. In Zimbabwe , an examination of 27 stomachs revealed that during the warm, wet summer months (October to April), 70% contained insects, (predominantly grasshoppers and beetles), followed by 40% fruits, 30% rodents ( Muridae , mainly multimammate mice Mastomys spp. , and the Angoni Vlei Rat, Otomys angoniensis), 30% reptiles, 20% amphibians, 20% myriapodes, 20% grass, and 10% birds. In the colder, dryer months (May to September), the highest percentage of occurrence was 57% fruits, followed by 43% insects, 43% Muridae , 21% birds, 21% grass, 14% reptiles, and 7% amphibians. Animal prey also included Scrub Hare (Lepus saxatilis), Banded Mongoose, Common Slender Mongoose, Smith’s Bush Squirrel (Paraxerus cepapr), South African Spring Hare (Pedetes capensis), and helmeted guineatowl (Numida meleagris). Carrion of Impala (Aepyceros melampus), Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), Bushbuck (7: scriptus), and Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) was also eaten. A similar diet has been reported in West and East Africa, but aquatic organisms (crabs, snails, and mudskippers) were also eaten. In Nigeria , stomach contents contained rodents, reptiles, insects, birds, amphibians, gastropods, and plants. In the Central African Republic , the frequency of occurrence in scats was 97% arthropods, 73% fruits, 30% rodents, 3% reptiles, and 3% birds. In Zaire, scats contained eleven fruit species ( Arecaceae , Burseraceae , Moraceae , Myristicaceae , and Sapindaceae ); seasonal variations were observed and a wider diversity of fruits was consumed during the rainy season. A civet feeding on a fruiting tree immediately exploited a nearby outbreak of millipedes. Their behavior in captivity suggests that they detect their prey mainly by scent and sound, rather than vision. Animal prey is seized by the mouth, the paws are not usually used in the capture and the killing bite is often directed at the head. Various methods have been observed when attacking live prey: run-away bite (a quick nip aimed at any part of the prey’s body, followed by instant release and retreat); bite-and-throw (the prey is held long enough to be thrown quickly aside with a quick movement of the head); bite-and-shake (the grip is retained and the prey is shaken to break the vertebrae); killing bite (the jaws bite home firmly). Activity patterns. Predominantly nocturnal, with peaks in activity one to two hours before sunset until midnight, and around sunrise. Occasionally seen in the morning or afternoon on overcast days. In Ethiopia , diurnal rest sites were in dense vegetation on the ground, mostly in an area of dense Juniper forest (nine out of eleven sites). In Zaire, African Civets selected dens close to fruit-bearing trees and moved away when the fruiting season was over. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although groups consisting of an adult and young have been observed. Terrestrial; they are poor climbers, but are known to clamber along low stout branches to get at ripening fruit. In Ethiopia , a radio-collared sub-adult male had a home range of 11-1 km? the core area was 0-4 km?, centered on Hagenia and Juniper forests. On one occasion, this male was found within 20 meters of a White-tailed Mongoose. African Civets deposit their feces in latrines (civetries); these are usually located along game trails and in clearings and may play a role in marking territories. Some are used frequently and then abandoned for periods of several months. They tend to use the same sites, even when the accumulation of scats is removed. In Zimbabwe , latrines were found in Asparagus thickets, in grassland, and in the cover of dense reed beds. In Zaire, four latrines were separated by several kilometres; each one was used by a single civet. These latrines were in natural hollows in the ground left by uprooted trees (35-65 cm deep and 60-170 cm wide), and all were close to a river (8-30 m). Urine may also play a role in scent marking: captive males have been observed to sniff a female’s urine, which prompted them to flehm. African Civets scent-mark objects with their perineal gland secretion (called civet), both on the ground and on vertical surfaces. In South Africa , they were found to mark trees (50%), rocks (29%), shrubs (19%), and herbs (10%); the mean height of marks above ground was 35 cm . They mark trees and shrubs that bear fruits eaten by them and also at or nearcivetries. Scent marks retain a strong musk odor for one month and are still detectable after four months. To mark a tree, the civet backs up, raises its tail, and presses the everted perineal gland against the trunk. Both sexes scent-mark, but males do it more frequently than females (the perineal gland is larger in the male). Captive females mark horizontal surfaces more than vertical ones; the opposite is true for males. Young animals scent-mark only in the squatting posture, whereas adults only perform the backing-up technique. African Civets do not emit perineal civet when alarmed, but they do sometimes mark when anxious or feeling insecure. Their senses of smell and hearing are acute (particularly for high pitched sounds). When at ease and alert, they move with the head held higher than the shoulder and the legs well extended. When anxious or in fear, they lower their head and flex the legs; the whole body sags, the eyes are narrowed, and the erectile crest is depressed. In a defensive threat, the dorsal crest is erected, the head is directed toward the source of alarm, and the body is turned sideways so that the change in size is visible to the opponent. An appeasement posture has been observed in captive civets and consists of lying down on one side. Although generally silent, several distinct vocalizations have been detected in captive animals: growl (frequently emitted by a female in defense of her kittens); cough-spit (when a terrified civet is approached); and scream (heard during serious fights). There are three different types of meow: a distress meow from kittens; a cat-like meow (made by the female during copulation); and the female sex call (emitted by the female before and during estrus). The most frequent vocalization is the contact call: a short sound, usually repeated three or four times, and sounds like “ha-ha-ha” emitted with the mouth closed. Breeding. Breeding seems to occur throughout the year in West Africa, but there may be favored breeding seasons in East Africa (March to October) and southern Africa (August to January). Sexual maturity is attained at around twelve months. Females are polyoestrous and can have two or three litters a year; the estrus period appears to last up to six days. Natal den sites are in holes made by other animals or in cavities under tangled roots. Breeding behavior has been observed in captivity. As the female comes into estrus, the male and female became more aggressive, the male gives more contact calls, and both sexes increase their locomotor activity. The male makes several mounting attempts before the female accepts him; she will often move away and sometimes turn to snap at the male. When the female is receptive, she shows this by breaking into a run and inciting the male to pursue her. After several unsuccessful mounting attempts, the female finally lies down (with her hindquarters slightly raised) and permits the male to mount. The male places his forelegs on both sides of the female’s shoulders and makes treading movements with his hindlegs on each side of her flanks. Pelvic thrusting then takes place, during which the male bites the female’s fur between the shoulders. During copulation, the female gives a long meow; the male dismounts after forty seconds. After copulating, each civetlicks its genitals. Copulations take place at night. Gestation is 60 to 81 days. Litter size in captivity ranges from one to four. The young are born with short dark soft fur; the neck stripe is present, but is pale grayish and less conspicuous than in the adult. The facial pattern is indistinct, but the white muzzle marks are present. The perineal gland in the young is genet-like; the pouch is marked by an area of pale hairs, in the center of which the naked lips of the gland are visible. In female young, there is a patch of naked skin around the anus and a hairless isthmus links the lips of the gland. At one month old, the dark hairlines that traverse the adult pocket start to appear. Growth of the pocket conceals the naked lips, which are then only visible when everted. The eyes are open at birth or within the first few days. Newborns can crawl at birth; at five days they can stand on their hindlegs. They start to play at 14 days and to explore outside the den at 17-18 days. The motherlicks her young all over, with special attention to the perineal region, and consumes the urine and feces voided in response to this stimulation. The young are not given the opportunity to urinate independently before they are 25 days old. They are dependant on the mother’s milk for up to six weeks; they usually suckle from the posterior teats and it seems that each young always uses the same one. They start eating solid food in their second month and weaning occurs at around 14 to 16 weeks. In the second month, the young begin to catch insects and at 42 days the mother provides solid food. Mouth suckling (the young lick their mother’s mouth) is exhibited immediately before the mother begins to provide solid food. Weights of young are: 162 g at six days; 440-540 g at 17 days; 480-550 g at 21 days; and 680-810 g at 33 days. During the fifth month, the young begin to mark vertical objects with the backing-up technique, the perineal gland secretion becomes strongly scented, and males first flehm in response to female urine. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Considered common and widespread, and is not thought to be threatened. However, some local populations could be threatened by hunting and civet farming. African Civets are hunted and sold in markets for bushmeat and for their skins. They are also kept on farms in Ethiopia for the purpose of extracting their perineal secretions for the perfume industry. Although exact numbers are not known, one estimate is that there are 180 civet farmers holding over 2700 African Civets. They are not bred on these farms and to replenish those that die, new animals are taken from the wild. There is still not much known about this species acrossits range and field studies are needed.

Some authors have included the Feline Genet (G. felina) as a subspecies of G. genetta , G. felina is treated here as a separate species. High intra-specific variability within the Common Genet makes clear distinctions between populations difficult to assess and over thirty subspecies have been described. A taxonomic revision is needed, but five subspecies are recognized here.","G. g. genetta Linnaeus, 1758 — SW Europe and N Africa from Morocco to Libya .

A medium-sized genet, with a slender body and a long tail. The coat color ranges from whitish-gray to pale yellow-rufous; the underparts are whitish, pale yellowish-gray or gray. The pelage has relatively long guard hairs. In the arid parts ofits range, the pelage is shorter and the coat color and spots are lighter. The head is small, with a pointed muzzle and small, upstanding round ears. The facial mask is relatively well marked, with a dark line on the muzzle and contrasting white suband supraocular white spots. The nuchal stripes are well defined. There is a thin, dark mid-dorsal line with long erectile hairs (up to 7-5 cm), which begins after the shoulder and runs to the base of the tail. The dark dorsal spots merge into longitudinal lines. The tail is relatively long, with eight to ten pale rings alternating with dark rings; the tip ofthetail is whitish. The pale rings and the dark rings are the same width, although the margins of the rings are often not clearly distinguishable due to the overlapping long guard hairs of the preceding ring. The foreand hindlimbs are spotted; the upper parts of the feet are lightly spotted. The underparts of the hindlimb and feet are dark. There are five digits on each foot; the first digits are slightly set back and do not mark in the print. The central depression of the forefeet is hairy. The forefeet have reduced metacarpal pads and the hindfeet bear two very narrow, elongated metatarsal pads. The claws are sharp, curved, and retractile. The perineal gland opens into a longitudinal Y-shaped slit. There are two pairs of teats. The baculum in the male is well-developed. The skull is medium-size and ovoid, with a strong sagittal crest. The rostrum is narrow and elongated. The inter-orbital constriction is weakly marked and the zygomatic arches are lightly built. The post-orbital processes of the frontal and jugal bones are almost totally absent. The auditory bullae are elongated, with the anterior chambers only slightly smaller than the posterior chambers. The premaxillary-frontal contact is absent and the posterior extension of the frontal bones is moderate, overlapping about 50% of the dorsal region of the inter-orbital constriction. The ratio between the inter-orbital constriction and frontal width is 1 + 0-12. Dental formula: 1 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The upper canines are elongated, curved and sharp, and the second upper molar and the second lower molars are small. The presence and development of the inner cusp of the third upper premolar is variable. The maxillary-palatine suture is at the same level as the main cusp of P°.","Occurs in a wide range of habitats. Often associated with trees and bushes, but can also be found in rocky, treeless areas. Seems to avoid dense rainforest and very arid zones, but can be found in close proximity to human dwellings. In Morocco , the Common Genet is found in forests and bushy areas (mainly in the mountains), rocky ravines (preferably vegetated and near water), and in the Sahara fringe (where it is common in oases and other productive areas). In Algeria , it is found in riparian forests at sea level and up to 2000 m in the Djurjura Mountains, where it occupies all types of habitats (most abundant in old forests of Quercus ilex and Cedrus atlantica). In West Africa, it occurs in wooded savannahs. In the Ethiopian Highlands, a radio-collared female was found in woodland (84% of the time), bush (9%), farmland (5%), and grassland (2%). In Tanzania , Common Genets were camera-trapped in lowland forest. In the Serengeti, they are strongly associated with trees and thickets and are frequently seen on escarpments, rocky outcrops, and other hills. In Botswana , they are found in all the major vegetation associations (including riverine forests and open, dry scrub savannahs): 47 genets were captured in Acacia woodland or scrub, 16 in mopane (Colophospermum mopane) woodland or scrub, twelve in Terminalia-Bauhinia scrub, nine in unspecified riverine forests, nine in open grassland (with scattered bushes and trees), and lower numbers in other habitats. The Common Genet does not occur in open habitats unless there is some adjacent scrub cover or isolated patches of trees with underbrush, which suggests that scrub cover or woodland is an essential habitat requirement. In some places, the Common Genet can penetrate into deserts along seasonal watercourses. In Arabia, it is said to inhabit dry ravines in hills and mountains. In Europe, itis especially abundant in oak forests (Quercus spp.) and is also common in olive groves (Olea europaea), riparian copses, ash groves (Fraxinus spp.), pine forests, rocky areas, and scrublands, but is rare or absent in open areas, marshes, and agricultural fields. Common Genets prefer to live at low altitudes, especially in northern areas, which suggests that cold temperatures may restrict its distribution: in central Spain , genets were scarce on plateaux and the upper parts of mountains (not found above 1400 m ), but were widely distributed in lower mountain areas. They were present in areas with abundant scrub cover and high mean temperatures. In northern Spain , three radio-collared males showed a strong preference for holm oak forest; pine plantations were avoided, eucalyptus plantations were used according to availability, and other habitats such as meadows, gardens, and crops near houses, were used opportunistically by two of the three genets.","Feeds mainly on small mammals, but also eats other small vertebrates (including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish), invertebrates (mainly insects), eggs, fruits, and sometimes grass. Field studies have shown seasonal and geographical variations in the diet (frequency of occurrence of food items). In south-west France (woodlands with rocky areas): 73% small mammals, including rodents (mainly Apodemus sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus, Arvicola sapidus, Pitymys and Microtus spp.), insectivores ( Sorex spp. , Talpa europaea, Crocidura russula, and Neomys fodiens), and occasionally a few mustelids Least Weasel and Ermine. Other prey items included: 10% birds (mainly passerines), 9% insects (Coleoptera and Orthoptera), 1% amphibians, 0-7% reptiles, 0-6% European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), 0-2% fish, and a few eggs. Plant remains included 13% grass, and 10% fruits and berries. Some seasonal variations were observed. The percentage of small mammals in the diet remained stable, but more birds were eaten during winter and fewer during spring, and the consumption offruits followed the fruiting season, being consumed mainly in the summer and autumn. In north-west France (marshy forest): 71% small mammals, 18% birds, 8% arthropods, and 2% rabbits. In north-west France (broad-leaved forest with pastures): 59% small mammals, 26% birds, 7% arthropods, 3% rabbits, 0-7% reptiles, and 0-4% amphibians. In north-west Spain (broad-leaved forest and riparian forest): 67% small mammals, 18% arthropods, 8% birds, 4% amphibians, and 2% reptiles. In north-east Spain (riparian forest): 34% arthropods, 30% small mammals, 10% reptiles, 7% birds, 4% rabbits, and 1% amphibians. In central Spain (holm oak and broad-leaved forests): 36% arthropods, 30% birds, 28% small mammals, 7% reptiles, 4% amphibians, and 0-2% rabbits. In southern Spain (Mediterranean shrubs): 65% small mammals, 16% birds, 8% arthropods, 7% amphibians, 4% rabbits, and 3% reptiles. In central Portugal : 58% mammals (42% rodents, 8% insectivores, 8% rabbits), 15% arthropods, 11% birds, 2% reptiles, 1% gastropods, 0-7% eggs, 9% fruits and 2% plants. Small mammals were consumed more in the autumn and winter, birds and fruits in the spring and summer. In north-west Portugal , rodents were the main prey (particularly Apodemus sylvaticus and Microtus agrestis), followed by insectivores and birds (particularly in the spring). Reptiles were consumed mostly in the spring and fruits in the summer. On Mallorca (Mediterranean forest): 47% small mammals, 25% arthropods, 23% reptiles, 4% rabbits, 3% birds, and 1% amphibians. Another study on Mallorca (Mediterranean forest): 91% mammals, 39% plants, 20% birds, 18% arthropods, and 8% reptiles. On Ibiza (Mediterranean shrubs): 45% small mammals, 19% reptiles, 18% arthropods, 10% amphibians, 6% birds, and 0-7% rabbits. Another study on Ibiza (Mediterranean shrubs): 92% mammals, 42% plants, 32% birds, 18% reptiles, and 12% arthropods. On Cabrera Island (Mediterranean shrubs): 46% arthropods, 40% reptiles, 16% small mammals, 11% amphibians, 5% birds, and 2% rabbits. Another study on Cabrera Island (Mediterranean shrubs): 70% mammals, 48% birds, 31% plants, 26% reptiles, and 21% arthropods. In Morocco (oak forest): 72% small mammals, 19% arthropods, 4% birds, 3% reptiles, 1% amphibians, and 2% fruits. In north-east Algeria (riparian forest): 64% arthropods, 23% small mammals, 7% amphibians, 3% reptiles, 1% birds, 0-6% fish, and 2% fruit. In north-east Algeria (Mediterranean montane forest), 62% arthropods, 20% small mammals, 12% birds, 3% reptiles, and 1% amphibians. In Zimbabwe : 66% insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Isoptera), 51% rodents ( Mastomys spp. , Mus spp. , Tatera spp. , Rattus rattus, Saccostomus campestris, and Steatomys pratensis), 31% arachnids, 10% birds, 10% reptiles, 3% shrews ( Soricidae ), 3% amphibians, and 3% Myiaodia. In Botswana : 73% insects (Orthoptera, Isoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera), 53% arachnids, 50% rodents ( Mastomys spp. , Mus spp. , Tatera spp. , Rattus rattus, Saccostomus campestris, Steatomys pratensis, Gerbillurus paeba, Thallomys paedulcus, Otomys angoniensis, and Aethomys spp. ), 18% reptiles, 6% birds, 5% Myriapodia, 1% shrews ( Soricidae ), 1% Chiroptera, 1% dormice ( Muscardinidae ), and 5% fruits. Foraging takes place at night. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal. In Senegal , 25 nocturnal observations were recorded between 20:00-22:30 h. In Botswana , the earliest sightings were just after dark at 19:00 h, with activity recorded until 02:00 h. In Ethiopia , a radio-tracking study showed that Common Genets were nocturnal; four genets were also seen at night. In Spain , a radio-collared male was exclusively nocturnal; a young female was active 65% during the night, but was also active 19% of the time during the day. Both genets showed greater activity from sunset to midnight and the male had a secondary peak of activityjust before sunrise. In south-east Spain , radio-collared genets were primarily nocturnal, but were active 29% of the time during the day. Restsites are in trees (hollow trunks and branches), hollow logs, dense thickets and bushes, rocky areas, and holes in the ground. In Ethiopia , a female genet used several diurnal resting sites, most of them in trees. In Spain , a young female and an adult male both used areas with high ground cover for resting. The diurnal resting sites were located in dense thickets (86% in the young female, 36% in the male) and in treetops (14% and 64%, respectively). When both were available, they usually selected thickets. In treetops, they generally used old bird nests, pine-needle tufts, and dry pine branches, 4-15 m above the ground. Restsites changed each day. The mean distance between consecutive daybeds was 277 m for the female and 2175 m for the male. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although pairs have occasionally been observed. Common Genets are proficient climbers, but most of their activity appears to be on the ground. In Tanzania , one marked individual was observed using an area of 0-25 km®. In Ethiopia , a radio-collared juvenile female had a home range of 0-34 km?and a lactating female had a range of 0-62 km?*; both ranges closely overlapped with each other. In southern Ethiopia , a female had a home range of 1-7 km?, with a core area of 0-2 km* (centered on Hagenia and Juniperus woodlands). In southwestern Spain , a young female had a home range of 1-4 km? she used 0-2 km?® in the first month, 0-7 km? the second, and 1-2 km®in the third, suggesting that she was increasing her home range as she got older. The radio-collared male in this study appeared to be a dispersing individual as he covered an area of 50 km ? The mean daily distance travelled in 24 hours was 2978 m for the female and 8050 m for the male. Two types of movement were detected: a zig-zag run (associated with searching for food and hunting) and a more or less straight-line run (travelling). Further studies in southwestern Spain , revealed a mean home range size of 7-8 km? for eight individuals (range 0-73-14-71 km?); there was a large inter-sexual and a low intra-sexual overlap of ranges. The mean distance travelled was 2: 78 km /day; the mean distance between consecutive resting sites was 0-73 km. The density of adults was estimated to be 0-33 individuals/km?®. In northern Spain , three males had home ranges of 2-12, 3-39, and 10-16 km®. In north-east Spain , the mean annual home range size was 1-13 km” in males and 0-72 km? in females; resting home range sizes were nine times lower than overall home range sizes. Home range sizes changed with the seasons and were smallestin the summer (0-41 km? in males and 0-29 km? in females) and largest in the spring (0-79 km? in males and 0-56 km?” in females). Core areas represented 27% ofthe total home range in males and 19% in females. Intra-sexual home range overlap was lower than inter-sexual overlap; there was no overlap of core areas. The minimum density was 0-98 individuals/km*. Common Genets deposit their feces in latrines, which are either elevated (on rocks and in trees) or on the ground. More than one individual may use the same latrine and a large number of feces can be found in them. They are more frequently located on the edges of home ranges. In Spain , the number of feces in 27 latrines ranged from one to 27, with seven containing only one scat. More than one individual appeared to use these latrines. Feces were found in trees (44% on main trunks, 22% on secondary trunks, 15% on raptor nests, and 7% on branches), on thickets or hedges (7%), and on the ground (4%). Feces on trees were situated on average 4-2 m high. Each genet tended to deposit feces all over the surface of the latrine (never over fresh feces, but over old ones). Scattered feces were also found on the ground. Within the study area, Common Genets inhabited mesic scrubland patches and preferentially deposited their feces on the edges of these patches. The number of feces in latrines was highest in February-March and November-December, and lowest in April-August. Among 15 latrines, only five were continuously used for at least four months and only one was always used. All were close to resting sites and when these were deserted the latrines were no longer used. In central Spain , fecalsites were in areas with high rock and shrub cover, habitats that provided good feeding places and refuges. In south-west Portugal , the selection of latrine and scent marking sites was driven by the availability of shelter and food: latrines were more often in habitat with high understory cover. Latrines were usually located on conspicuous structures: old-growth trees were the dominant latrine sites. In south-west France , latrines were often located on rocks and were found to contain ten to 65 feces, but those with higher numbers were rare and isolated feces were also found. Common Genets also use the secretion from their perineal gland and urine as a means of communication. While scent marking, they adopt a handstand posture or a flexion of the hindlegs. In captivity, scent marking behavior increased in the male and decreased in the female during the breeding season; it increased again in the female after mating, but decreased again before parturition. Captive males and females sniffed the scent marks of unknown genets more than those of known genets (of the opposite sex). They also spent more time sniffing marks of other genets than their own marks. The Common Genet also scent-marks by flank rubbing, which consists of rubbing the cheek, neck and dorsal parts of the flank against unscented vertical surfaces; these body regions have a higher density of sebaceous glands. Males are able to recognize the physiological state offemales from sniffing scent marks left by flank rubbing. Flank rubbing increases during agonistic encounters and is generally associated with visual threat signals, such as piloerection of the dorsal crest and the tail. Intimidating behavior in Common Genets is very cat-like, with an arched-back stance, erection of the dorsal crest and tail hairs, hissing, and an open mouth showing the teeth.",,"Primarily nocturnal. In Senegal , 25 nocturnal observations were recorded between 20:00-22:30 h. In Botswana , the earliest sightings were just after dark at 19:00 h, with activity recorded until 02:00 h.

There may be two breeding seasons in Kenya , from March to May and September to December, which correspond to the wet seasons. One adult female was found lactating in southwestern Ethiopia at the end of November and a pregnant female was recorded in Zambia in February. Most pregnant females were detected in Botswana from October to February. Elsewhere in southern Africa, pregnant females have been taken in September, October, and January. In Europe and North Africa, mating mainly occurs in the spring and autumn; birth peaks are in April to June and September to November. Breeding behavior has been mainly observed in captivity. Several days before mating, the male and female increase their uro-genital marking activity; the male emits contact calls, and sniffs the ano-genital region and flanks of the female. Copulations occur at night, last two or three minutes, and are repeated up to five times. Gestation is 70 to 77 days. Natal den sites are in hollow trees, burrows, and rocky crevices. Litter size is one to four; the most common number is two. Newborns are covered with hair and have closed ears and eyes. Weight at birth is 60 to 85 g ; the young are 300 g at one month, 450 g at two months, 900 g at four months, and 1500 g at eight months. They nurse during the first four months and start eating solid food when they are about 45 days old. They start to pursue prey at twelve weeks and have acquired their predator skills by the 18"" week. They are sexually mature at around 19-24 months.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Possibly introduced to Spain during historical times and has spread to France and Portugal . Individuals have also been recorded in Belgium , Germany , Holland , Italy , and Switzerland .The populations on Ibiza Island, sometimes considered a distinct subspecies (G. g. isabelae), were classified as Vulnerable on the The IUCN Red List. Listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and on the EU Habitats and Species Directive, Annex V. The Common Genetis not considered threatened because of its wide distribution and its generalist habitat and food preferences. However, it is eaten by people in some African localities and the body parts are used for medicinal purposes. In southern Africa, they have been reported for sale in city markets.","Admasu et al.

High intra-specific variability within the Common Genet makes clear distinctions between populations difficult to assess and over thirty subspecies have been described. A taxonomic revision is needed, but five subspecies are recognized here. Subspecies and Distribution. G. g. genetta Linnaeus, 1758 — SW Europe and N Africa from Morocco to Libya . G. g. dongolana Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1833 — E, NE & C Africa. G. g. grantii Thomas, 1902 — SW Arabian Peninsula in Saudi Arabia and Yemen , and Oman . G. g. pulchra Matschie, 1902 — Angola , Namibia , Botswana , W Zambia , and NE South Africa . G. g. senegalensis Fischer, 1829 — W Africa. Descriptive notes. Head-body 46.5-52 cm (males), 46-5— 49 cm (females), tail 42-51. 6 cm (males), 40-51. 6 cm (females), hindfoot 8.9-7 cm (males), 8:2.9-1 cm (females), ear 4-6 cm (males), 4-:2.6-5 cm (females); weight 1:6.2-6 kg (males), 1.4-2. 3 kg (females). A medium-sized genet, with a slender body and a long tail. The coat color ranges from whitish-gray to pale yellow-rufous; the underparts are whitish, pale yellowish-gray or gray. The pelage has relatively long guard hairs. In the arid parts ofits range, the pelage is shorter and the coat color and spots are lighter. The head is small, with a pointed muzzle and small, upstanding round ears. The facial mask is relatively well marked, with a dark line on the muzzle and contrasting white suband supraocular white spots. The nuchal stripes are well defined. There is a thin, dark mid-dorsal line with long erectile hairs (up to 7-5 cm), which begins after the shoulder and runs to the base of the tail. The dark dorsal spots merge into longitudinal lines. The tail is relatively long, with eight to ten pale rings alternating with dark rings; the tip ofthetail is whitish. The pale rings and the dark rings are the same width, although the margins of the rings are often not clearly distinguishable due to the overlapping long guard hairs of the preceding ring. The foreand hindlimbs are spotted; the upper parts of the feet are lightly spotted. The underparts of the hindlimb and feet are dark. There are five digits on each foot; the first digits are slightly set back and do not mark in the print. The central depression of the forefeet is hairy. The forefeet have reduced metacarpal pads and the hindfeet bear two very narrow, elongated metatarsal pads. The claws are sharp, curved, and retractile. The perineal gland opens into a longitudinal Y-shaped slit. There are two pairs of teats. The baculum in the male is well-developed. The skull is medium-size and ovoid, with a strong sagittal crest. The rostrum is narrow and elongated. The inter-orbital constriction is weakly marked and the zygomatic arches are lightly built. The post-orbital processes of the frontal and jugal bones are almost totally absent. The auditory bullae are elongated, with the anterior chambers only slightly smaller than the posterior chambers. The premaxillary-frontal contact is absent and the posterior extension of the frontal bones is moderate, overlapping about 50% of the dorsal region of the inter-orbital constriction. The ratio between the inter-orbital constriction and frontal width is 1 + 0-12. Dental formula: 1 3/3, C 1/1, P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The upper canines are elongated, curved and sharp, and the second upper molar and the second lower molars are small. The presence and development of the inner cusp of the third upper premolar is variable. The maxillary-palatine suture is at the same level as the main cusp of P°. Habitat. Occurs in a wide range of habitats. Often associated with trees and bushes, but can also be found in rocky, treeless areas. Seems to avoid dense rainforest and very arid zones, but can be found in close proximity to human dwellings. In Morocco , the Common Genet is found in forests and bushy areas (mainly in the mountains), rocky ravines (preferably vegetated and near water), and in the Sahara fringe (where it is common in oases and other productive areas). In Algeria , it is found in riparian forests at sea level and up to 2000 m in the Djurjura Mountains, where it occupies all types of habitats (most abundant in old forests of Quercus ilex and Cedrus atlantica). In West Africa, it occurs in wooded savannahs. In the Ethiopian Highlands, a radio-collared female was found in woodland (84% of the time), bush (9%), farmland (5%), and grassland (2%). In Tanzania , Common Genets were camera-trapped in lowland forest. In the Serengeti, they are strongly associated with trees and thickets and are frequently seen on escarpments, rocky outcrops, and other hills. In Botswana , they are found in all the major vegetation associations (including riverine forests and open, dry scrub savannahs): 47 genets were captured in Acacia woodland or scrub, 16 in mopane (Colophospermum mopane) woodland or scrub, twelve in Terminalia-Bauhinia scrub, nine in unspecified riverine forests, nine in open grassland (with scattered bushes and trees), and lower numbers in other habitats. The Common Genet does not occur in open habitats unless there is some adjacent scrub cover or isolated patches of trees with underbrush, which suggests that scrub cover or woodland is an essential habitat requirement. In some places, the Common Genet can penetrate into deserts along seasonal watercourses. In Arabia, it is said to inhabit dry ravines in hills and mountains. In Europe, itis especially abundant in oak forests (Quercus spp.) and is also common in olive groves (Olea europaea), riparian copses, ash groves (Fraxinus spp.), pine forests, rocky areas, and scrublands, but is rare or absent in open areas, marshes, and agricultural fields. Common Genets prefer to live at low altitudes, especially in northern areas, which suggests that cold temperatures may restrict its distribution: in central Spain , genets were scarce on plateaux and the upper parts of mountains (not found above 1400 m ), but were widely distributed in lower mountain areas. They were present in areas with abundant scrub cover and high mean temperatures. In northern Spain , three radio-collared males showed a strong preference for holm oak forest; pine plantations were avoided, eucalyptus plantations were used according to availability, and other habitats such as meadows, gardens, and crops near houses, were used opportunistically by two of the three genets. Food and Feeding. Feeds mainly on small mammals, but also eats other small vertebrates (including birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish), invertebrates (mainly insects), eggs, fruits, and sometimes grass. Field studies have shown seasonal and geographical variations in the diet (frequency of occurrence of food items). In south-west France (woodlands with rocky areas): 73% small mammals, including rodents (mainly Apodemus sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus, Arvicola sapidus, Pitymys and Microtus spp.), insectivores ( Sorex spp. , Talpa europaea, Crocidura russula, and Neomys fodiens), and occasionally a few mustelids Least Weasel and Ermine. Other prey items included: 10% birds (mainly passerines), 9% insects (Coleoptera and Orthoptera), 1% amphibians, 0-7% reptiles, 0-6% European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), 0-2% fish, and a few eggs. Plant remains included 13% grass, and 10% fruits and berries. Some seasonal variations were observed. The percentage of small mammals in the diet remained stable, but more birds were eaten during winter and fewer during spring, and the consumption offruits followed the fruiting season, being consumed mainly in the summer and autumn. In north-west France (marshy forest): 71% small mammals, 18% birds, 8% arthropods, and 2% rabbits. In north-west France (broad-leaved forest with pastures): 59% small mammals, 26% birds, 7% arthropods, 3% rabbits, 0-7% reptiles, and 0-4% amphibians. In north-west Spain (broad-leaved forest and riparian forest): 67% small mammals, 18% arthropods, 8% birds, 4% amphibians, and 2% reptiles. In north-east Spain (riparian forest): 34% arthropods, 30% small mammals, 10% reptiles, 7% birds, 4% rabbits, and 1% amphibians. In central Spain (holm oak and broad-leaved forests): 36% arthropods, 30% birds, 28% small mammals, 7% reptiles, 4% amphibians, and 0-2% rabbits. In southern Spain (Mediterranean shrubs): 65% small mammals, 16% birds, 8% arthropods, 7% amphibians, 4% rabbits, and 3% reptiles. In central Portugal : 58% mammals (42% rodents, 8% insectivores, 8% rabbits), 15% arthropods, 11% birds, 2% reptiles, 1% gastropods, 0-7% eggs, 9% fruits and 2% plants. Small mammals were consumed more in the autumn and winter, birds and fruits in the spring and summer. In north-west Portugal , rodents were the main prey (particularly Apodemus sylvaticus and Microtus agrestis), followed by insectivores and birds (particularly in the spring). Reptiles were consumed mostly in the spring and fruits in the summer. On Mallorca (Mediterranean forest): 47% small mammals, 25% arthropods, 23% reptiles, 4% rabbits, 3% birds, and 1% amphibians. Another study on Mallorca (Mediterranean forest): 91% mammals, 39% plants, 20% birds, 18% arthropods, and 8% reptiles. On Ibiza (Mediterranean shrubs): 45% small mammals, 19% reptiles, 18% arthropods, 10% amphibians, 6% birds, and 0-7% rabbits. Another study on Ibiza (Mediterranean shrubs): 92% mammals, 42% plants, 32% birds, 18% reptiles, and 12% arthropods. On Cabrera Island (Mediterranean shrubs): 46% arthropods, 40% reptiles, 16% small mammals, 11% amphibians, 5% birds, and 2% rabbits. Another study on Cabrera Island (Mediterranean shrubs): 70% mammals, 48% birds, 31% plants, 26% reptiles, and 21% arthropods. In Morocco (oak forest): 72% small mammals, 19% arthropods, 4% birds, 3% reptiles, 1% amphibians, and 2% fruits. In north-east Algeria (riparian forest): 64% arthropods, 23% small mammals, 7% amphibians, 3% reptiles, 1% birds, 0-6% fish, and 2% fruit. In north-east Algeria (Mediterranean montane forest), 62% arthropods, 20% small mammals, 12% birds, 3% reptiles, and 1% amphibians. In Zimbabwe : 66% insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Isoptera), 51% rodents ( Mastomys spp. , Mus spp. , Tatera spp. , Rattus rattus, Saccostomus campestris, and Steatomys pratensis), 31% arachnids, 10% birds, 10% reptiles, 3% shrews ( Soricidae ), 3% amphibians, and 3% Myiaodia. In Botswana : 73% insects (Orthoptera, Isoptera, Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera), 53% arachnids, 50% rodents ( Mastomys spp. , Mus spp. , Tatera spp. , Rattus rattus, Saccostomus campestris, Steatomys pratensis, Gerbillurus paeba, Thallomys paedulcus, Otomys angoniensis, and Aethomys spp. ), 18% reptiles, 6% birds, 5% Myriapodia, 1% shrews ( Soricidae ), 1% Chiroptera, 1% dormice ( Muscardinidae ), and 5% fruits. Foraging takes place at night. Activity patterns. Primarily nocturnal. In Senegal , 25 nocturnal observations were recorded between 20:00-22:30 h. In Botswana , the earliest sightings were just after dark at 19:00 h, with activity recorded until 02:00 h. In Ethiopia , a radio-tracking study showed that Common Genets were nocturnal; four genets were also seen at night. In Spain , a radio-collared male was exclusively nocturnal; a young female was active 65% during the night, but was also active 19% of the time during the day. Both genets showed greater activity from sunset to midnight and the male had a secondary peak of activityjust before sunrise. In south-east Spain , radio-collared genets were primarily nocturnal, but were active 29% of the time during the day. Restsites are in trees (hollow trunks and branches), hollow logs, dense thickets and bushes, rocky areas, and holes in the ground. In Ethiopia , a female genet used several diurnal resting sites, most of them in trees. In Spain , a young female and an adult male both used areas with high ground cover for resting. The diurnal resting sites were located in dense thickets (86% in the young female, 36% in the male) and in treetops (14% and 64%, respectively). When both were available, they usually selected thickets. In treetops, they generally used old bird nests, pine-needle tufts, and dry pine branches, 4-15 m above the ground. Restsites changed each day. The mean distance between consecutive daybeds was 277 m for the female and 2175 m for the male. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, although pairs have occasionally been observed. Common Genets are proficient climbers, but most of their activity appears to be on the ground. In Tanzania , one marked individual was observed using an area of 0-25 km®. In Ethiopia , a radio-collared juvenile female had a home range of 0-34 km?and a lactating female had a range of 0-62 km?*; both ranges closely overlapped with each other. In southern Ethiopia , a female had a home range of 1-7 km?, with a core area of 0-2 km* (centered on Hagenia and Juniperus woodlands). In southwestern Spain , a young female had a home range of 1-4 km? she used 0-2 km?® in the first month, 0-7 km? the second, and 1-2 km®in the third, suggesting that she was increasing her home range as she got older. The radio-collared male in this study appeared to be a dispersing individual as he covered an area of 50 km ? The mean daily distance travelled in 24 hours was 2978 m for the female and 8050 m for the male. Two types of movement were detected: a zig-zag run (associated with searching for food and hunting) and a more or less straight-line run (travelling). Further studies in southwestern Spain , revealed a mean home range size of 7-8 km? for eight individuals (range 0-73-14-71 km?); there was a large inter-sexual and a low intra-sexual overlap of ranges. The mean distance travelled was 2: 78 km /day; the mean distance between consecutive resting sites was 0-73 km. The density of adults was estimated to be 0-33 individuals/km?®. In northern Spain , three males had home ranges of 2-12, 3-39, and 10-16 km®. In north-east Spain , the mean annual home range size was 1-13 km” in males and 0-72 km? in females; resting home range sizes were nine times lower than overall home range sizes. Home range sizes changed with the seasons and were smallestin the summer (0-41 km? in males and 0-29 km? in females) and largest in the spring (0-79 km? in males and 0-56 km?” in females). Core areas represented 27% ofthe total home range in males and 19% in females. Intra-sexual home range overlap was lower than inter-sexual overlap; there was no overlap of core areas. The minimum density was 0-98 individuals/km*. Common Genets deposit their feces in latrines, which are either elevated (on rocks and in trees) or on the ground. More than one individual may use the same latrine and a large number of feces can be found in them. They are more frequently located on the edges of home ranges. In Spain , the number of feces in 27 latrines ranged from one to 27, with seven containing only one scat. More than one individual appeared to use these latrines. Feces were found in trees (44% on main trunks, 22% on secondary trunks, 15% on raptor nests, and 7% on branches), on thickets or hedges (7%), and on the ground (4%). Feces on trees were situated on average 4-2 m high. Each genet tended to deposit feces all over the surface of the latrine (never over fresh feces, but over old ones). Scattered feces were also found on the ground. Within the study area, Common Genets inhabited mesic scrubland patches and preferentially deposited their feces on the edges of these patches. The number of feces in latrines was highest in February-March and November-December, and lowest in April-August. Among 15 latrines, only five were continuously used for at least four months and only one was always used. All were close to resting sites and when these were deserted the latrines were no longer used. In central Spain , fecalsites were in areas with high rock and shrub cover, habitats that provided good feeding places and refuges. In south-west Portugal , the selection of latrine and scent marking sites was driven by the availability of shelter and food: latrines were more often in habitat with high understory cover. Latrines were usually located on conspicuous structures: old-growth trees were the dominant latrine sites. In south-west France , latrines were often located on rocks and were found to contain ten to 65 feces, but those with higher numbers were rare and isolated feces were also found. Common Genets also use the secretion from their perineal gland and urine as a means of communication. While scent marking, they adopt a handstand posture or a flexion of the hindlegs. In captivity, scent marking behavior increased in the male and decreased in the female during the breeding season; it increased again in the female after mating, but decreased again before parturition. Captive males and females sniffed the scent marks of unknown genets more than those of known genets (of the opposite sex). They also spent more time sniffing marks of other genets than their own marks. The Common Genet also scent-marks by flank rubbing, which consists of rubbing the cheek, neck and dorsal parts of the flank against unscented vertical surfaces; these body regions have a higher density of sebaceous glands. Males are able to recognize the physiological state offemales from sniffing scent marks left by flank rubbing. Flank rubbing increases during agonistic encounters and is generally associated with visual threat signals, such as piloerection of the dorsal crest and the tail. Intimidating behavior in Common Genets is very cat-like, with an arched-back stance, erection of the dorsal crest and tail hairs, hissing, and an open mouth showing the teeth. Breeding. There may be two breeding seasons in Kenya , from March to May and September to December, which correspond to the wet seasons. One adult female was found lactating in southwestern Ethiopia at the end of November and a pregnant female was recorded in Zambia in February. Most pregnant females were detected in Botswana from October to February. Elsewhere in southern Africa, pregnant females have been taken in September, October, and January. In Europe and North Africa, mating mainly occurs in the spring and autumn; birth peaks are in April to June and September to November. Breeding behavior has been mainly observed in captivity. Several days before mating, the male and female increase their uro-genital marking activity; the male emits contact calls, and sniffs the ano-genital region and flanks of the female. Copulations occur at night, last two or three minutes, and are repeated up to five times. Gestation is 70 to 77 days. Natal den sites are in hollow trees, burrows, and rocky crevices. Litter size is one to four; the most common number is two. Newborns are covered with hair and have closed ears and eyes. Weight at birth is 60 to 85 g ; the young are 300 g at one month, 450 g at two months, 900 g at four months, and 1500 g at eight months. They nurse during the first four months and start eating solid food when they are about 45 days old. They start to pursue prey at twelve weeks and have acquired their predator skills by the 18"" week. They are sexually mature at around 19-24 months. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Possibly introduced to Spain during historical times and has spread to France and Portugal . Individuals have also been recorded in Belgium , Germany , Holland , Italy , and Switzerland .The populations on Ibiza Island, sometimes considered a distinct subspecies (G. g. isabelae), were classified as Vulnerable on the The IUCN Red List. Listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention and on the EU Habitats and Species Directive, Annex V. The Common Genetis not considered threatened because of its wide distribution and its generalist habitat and food preferences. However, it is eaten by people in some African localities and the body parts are used for medicinal purposes. In southern Africa, they have been reported for sale in city markets. Bibliography.

Head—body 32.1-40 cm (males), 34.6-39. 5 cm (females), tail 35-2— 40-2 cm (males), 34.0-38 cm (females), hindfoot 5.7-6. 4 cm (males), 5.7-6. 1 cm (females), ear 2:9.3-7 cm (males), 3.3-4 cm (females); weight 510-750 g (males), 455 g (females). A small, slender genetlike carnivore, with a short, soft pelage. The coat color is yellowishto reddish-brown, with small, brownish-black spots of various shapes and sizes on the back and flanks, coalescing into stripes on the neck. These spots do not form longitudinal lines and are very small on the thighs and forelimbs. There is a dark mid-dorsal line, sometimes interrupted or absent. The ventral pelage is pale gray and unspotted. The head has a pointed muzzle, a gray rhinarium, wide rounded ears, and large yellowish-brown eyes. The feet are grayish, unmarked, and with hairy soles (except for the digital pads and a narrow bare line on the plantar surface). The tail has 9-14 alternating broad and narrow black bands, interspersed with pale rings. Dental formula: 13/3,C1/1,P4/4,M 1/2 =38. Habitat. Lowland and montane forest. Food and Feeding. Said to eat rodents, birds, insects, fruits, and other plant matter. Activity patterns. Thought to be nocturnal. Has been observed sleeping on thick tangled vines in trees. On Bioko Island, at 17:10 h, an individual was observed walking in a dry, rocky streambed with little vegetation, before it fled to the forest. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Thought to be arboreal. Breeding. A lactating female has been noted in October. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. A poorly known species and field studies are needed. There are no known major threats, but it may be undergoing localized decline due to forest loss and hunting for bushmeat and skins. Bibliography.

The black mid-dorsal line is continuous and is flanked on each side by four rows of oblong to squared spots, and by a few small-scattered spots below. There is a dorsal erectile crest. The face has a dark mask and a pair of white sub-ocular spots. The tail has seven to nine black rings, alternating with pale rings; the intervening white spaces are pigmented with a brownish tinge on the dorsal midline. The width of the pale rings relative to the dark rings in the middle of the tail is 50-75%; the tip of the tail is dark.

A slender genet with a short, soft pelage. Both sexes are similar in color and size. The coat color is extremely variable: sandy-gray, pale yellow, rufousgray, or gray-yellow. The ventral pelage is whitish-gray to pale yellow. The nuchal stripes are well defined. The continuous mid-dorsal line is the same color as the body spots;it begins after the shoulder and runs to the base of the tail. There is no dorsal crest. The spots are black to rufous-brown and variable in size and shape; the first two dorsal rows are round or square and sometimes coalesce at the rump. The face has a well-marked mask, a thin dark vertical line on the muzzle, and white suband supra-ocular spots. The tail has seven to nine pale rings alternating with dark rings. The width of the pale rings relative to the dark rings in the middle ofthe tail is 50-75%. The elongated dark tail tip is due to the suffusion of dark hairs in the last two pale rings. The hindlimbs and forelimbs are well spotted. The posterior region of the hindlimbs is densely covered in dark hairs. This coloration extends to the bottom of the hindfeet and borders the toes. The upper parts of the forefeet and hindfeet are the same color as the coat and are lightly spotted. The central depression of the forefeet is hairy. There are two pairs of teats. In juveniles, the coat is densely spotted, with a very irregular pattern. The skull is of medium size, with a thin sagittal crest and a narrow inter-orbital constriction. The posterior extension of the frontal bones is very narrow. The posterior chamber ofthe auditory bulla is not ventrally inflated and has a broken curve line on the external side. The maxillary-palatine suture is at the same level as the main cusp of P*. The ratio between the inter-orbital constriction and frontal width is lesss than 1 + 0-07.

Said to prefer wet habitats such as swamps and riparian areas. In Nigeria , it was positively correlated with derived savannah, oil palm plantations, and other altered habitats, whereas it was negatively correlated with various types offorests. In south-east Africa, it only occurs in areas with a mean annual rainfall exceeding 450 mm . In Ethiopia and Eritrea , it is found in wet forest, woodlands, and humid grassland. In Tanzania , it was camera-trapped in both open and closed lowland forests from 280 to 1470 m . It can live at high altitudes, such as the Simien Mountains ( Ethiopia ) and Mount Kilimanjaro ( Tanzania ).","Mainly carnivorous, although in some parts ofits range, fruits, seeds, and berries can be important foods. Animal prey includes small mammals, birds (and eggs), terrestrial and aquatic gastropods,bivalves, centipedes, millipedes,spiders, scorpions, insects, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, and reptiles (including lizards and snakes). The frequency of occurrence of food items in the diet has been determined in several places throughoutits range. In Zambia , scats contained 100% rodents (including Mastomys denniae, Mastomys sp. , Grammomys dolichurus, Otomys sp. , and Mus minuloides), 67% invertebrates, 67% insects (including Orthoptera), 39% grass, 33% amphibians, 11% insectivores ( Crocidura sp. ), and 6% reptiles. In Zimbabwe , stomach contents contained 68% murids (including Mastomys sp. ), 40% insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), 15% birds, 9% arachnids, 8% reptiles, 8% wild fruits, 3% shrews, 3% centipedes, 2% amphibians, 1% lagomorphs and 1% fish. In Botswana , the diet comprised 90% insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Isoptera), 47% murids (including the Pouched Mouse Saccostomus campestris), 27% arachnids, 17% wild fruits, 10% centipedes, 7% birds, and 1% reptiles, amphibians and other arthropods. In Kenya , the relative occurrence of food items found in scats was 74% seeds and fruit (more than 40 species) versus 82% arthropods and 44% other food remains (small mammals, reptiles, birds, snails, and leaves). In Nigeria , stomach contents contained small mammal species ( Praomys tullbergi, Cricetomys sp., Mus musculoides, Lemniscomys striatus, Hybomys univittatus, Dendromus sp., Crocidura nigeriae, Crocidura poensis , and Crocidura sp. ), insects (including Orthoptera and Coleoptera), birds, eggs, reptiles, fruits, seeds, centipedes, and spiders; there was a 70% overlap in diet with the sympatric Crested Genet, indicating strong interspecific competition for food between these two species. Bats have been recorded as prey items in South Africa (Pipistrellus capensis and genera Eptesicus, Scotophilus, and Rhinolophus) and Somalia (genus Tadarida). There are reports of Rusty-spotted Genets killing poultry: in Zimbabwe , stomach contents included domestic fowl (pheasants, young peafowl, pigeons, and chickens). There is little evidence that carrion is eaten, although some stomachs from South Africa did contain maggots. Rusty-spotted Genets forage both in trees and on the ground. Prey is caught by careful stalking, followed by a pounce. Before being killed,its prey is bitten several times or sometimes shaken. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal. In Kenya and Ethiopia , radio-collared genets were more active between sunset and sunrise than during daylight hours. Restsites include trees, hollow logs, under tree roots, in disused Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) or spring hare burrows, under boulders, rock overhangs, caves, and man-made shelters. Resting sites are reused by both sexes. On following pages: 17. Pardine Genet ( Genetta pardina ); 18. Aquatic Genet ( Genetta piscivora ); 19. King Genet ( Genetta poensis ): 20.

Two breeding peaks have been reported from Kenya : a main peak from October to December and another between March and May. In southern Africa, it appears that the breeding season extends from August to March. In South Africa , three young were found in February and two pregnant females, both with three fetuses, were recorded in November. Three two-week-old kittens were found in a hollow tree in northern Namibia in October. In Botswana , a female was found lactating during February and in Zimbabwe births were recorded from August to February. In Zambia , four-week-old juveniles were taken in October and November. Breeding behavior has been observed in captivity. A courting male, after sniffing the vulva of the female, exhibits a facial grimace (flehmen). He follows the female closely and produces grumbling and coughing calls. During the early stages of courtship, the female keeps turning away from the male, with hertail and hindquarters low, and flees. She eventually answers the male’s calls and allows him to come into close contact. Each partner then sniffs the other’s face and genitals, and they rub their cheeks. The female holds her tail up and crouches with raised hindquarters and tail deflected sideways. The male then clasps the female on the groin area, with his chest and belly resting on her lower back. As the female curves her spine, intromission occurs with pelvic thrusting. The male may sometimes bite the neck of the female during the final seconds of copulation, which usually lasts five minutes. Coupling pairs often meow. After copulating, the female may anal-drag and roll on her back, and both partners lick their genitals. Gestation is 70-77 days. Litter size appears to be two to five. Births take place in hollow trees, nests of leaves, and under roofs in urbanized habitats. Neonates are blind; they are covered with hair and have a discernable coat pattern. The eyes open at ten days and the first set of canines erupts at four weeks. These are shed after the permanent canines have erupted, at around 10-11 months. The mother licks her kittens ano-genitally and consumes their excrement. The young begin to take solid food at about six weeks, and may start to kill and eatlive vertebrates at about 28 weeks. At approximately eight weeks of age, the young start running, jumping, rolling, and playing fighting games.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Considered unthreatened as it has a wide range and occurs in a number of habitats. However, it may be declining in some areas due to hunting: it is found in bushmeat markets and is frequently trapped.

Rusty-spotted Genet Genetta maculata French: Genette a grandes taches / German: GroRfleckgenette / Spanish: Gineta de manchas grandes Other common names: Central African Large-spotted Genet Taxonomy. Viverra maculata Gray, 1830 , Ethiopia . The name G. rubiginosa has been also used for this species, butthis is now considered invalid. Has been considered conspecific with the Cape Genet ( G. tigrina ) and Pardine Genet (G. pardina ), and was sometimes also designated under the name G. tigrina . Recent morphometric and molecular studies have suggested that race letabae is a separate species, but this requires further investigation. Four subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. G. m. maculata Gray, 1830 — Ethiopia and Eritrea . G. m. letabae Thomas & Schwann, 1906 — W, C & E Africa, also in Angola , NE Namibia , Botswana , and SW Zambia . G. m. mossambica Matschie, 1902 — Mozambique and South Africa . G. m. zambesiana Matschie, 1902 — Malawi and Zimbabwe . Descriptive notes. Head-body 44:3-52. 1 cm (males), 41:1-49. 9 cm (females), tail 41.4-53. 5 cm (males), 39.5-54 cm (females), hindfoot 8:1.9-8 cm (males), 8.9-3 cm (females), ear 4.1-5 cm (males), 4.1-6. 5 cm (females); weight 1.4-3. 2 kg (males), 1.3-2. 5 kg (females). A slender genet with a short, soft pelage. Both sexes are similar in color and size. The coat color is extremely variable: sandy-gray, pale yellow, rufousgray, or gray-yellow. The ventral pelage is whitish-gray to pale yellow. The nuchal stripes are well defined. The continuous mid-dorsal line is the same color as the body spots;it begins after the shoulder and runs to the base of the tail. There is no dorsal crest. The spots are black to rufous-brown and variable in size and shape; the first two dorsal rows are round or square and sometimes coalesce at the rump. The face has a well-marked mask, a thin dark vertical line on the muzzle, and white suband supra-ocular spots. The tail has seven to nine pale rings alternating with dark rings. The width of the pale rings relative to the dark rings in the middle ofthe tail is 50-75%. The elongated dark tail tip is due to the suffusion of dark hairs in the last two pale rings. The hindlimbs and forelimbs are well spotted. The posterior region of the hindlimbs is densely covered in dark hairs. This coloration extends to the bottom of the hindfeet and borders the toes. The upper parts of the forefeet and hindfeet are the same color as the coat and are lightly spotted. The central depression of the forefeet is hairy. There are two pairs of teats. In juveniles, the coat is densely spotted, with a very irregular pattern. The skull is of medium size, with a thin sagittal crest and a narrow inter-orbital constriction. The posterior extension of the frontal bones is very narrow. The posterior chamber ofthe auditory bulla is not ventrally inflated and has a broken curve line on the external side. The maxillary-palatine suture is at the same level as the main cusp of P*. The ratio between the inter-orbital constriction and frontal width is lesss than 1 + 0-07. Dental formula:13/3,C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. Habitat. Primary and secondary rainforest, woodland savannah, savannah-forest mosaic, and montane forest. Also occurs in cultivated areas, farmlands, and suburbs. Said to prefer wet habitats such as swamps and riparian areas. In Nigeria , it was positively correlated with derived savannah, oil palm plantations, and other altered habitats, whereas it was negatively correlated with various types offorests. In south-east Africa, it only occurs in areas with a mean annual rainfall exceeding 450 mm . In Ethiopia and Eritrea , it is found in wet forest, woodlands, and humid grassland. In Tanzania , it was camera-trapped in both open and closed lowland forests from 280 to 1470 m . It can live at high altitudes, such as the Simien Mountains ( Ethiopia ) and Mount Kilimanjaro ( Tanzania ). Food and Feeding. Mainly carnivorous, although in some parts ofits range, fruits, seeds, and berries can be important foods. Animal prey includes small mammals, birds (and eggs), terrestrial and aquatic gastropods,bivalves, centipedes, millipedes,spiders, scorpions, insects, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, and reptiles (including lizards and snakes). The frequency of occurrence of food items in the diet has been determined in several places throughoutits range. In Zambia , scats contained 100% rodents (including Mastomys denniae, Mastomys sp. , Grammomys dolichurus, Otomys sp. , and Mus minuloides), 67% invertebrates, 67% insects (including Orthoptera), 39% grass, 33% amphibians, 11% insectivores ( Crocidura sp. ), and 6% reptiles. In Zimbabwe , stomach contents contained 68% murids (including Mastomys sp. ), 40% insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera), 15% birds, 9% arachnids, 8% reptiles, 8% wild fruits, 3% shrews, 3% centipedes, 2% amphibians, 1% lagomorphs and 1% fish. In Botswana , the diet comprised 90% insects (Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Isoptera), 47% murids (including the Pouched Mouse Saccostomus campestris), 27% arachnids, 17% wild fruits, 10% centipedes, 7% birds, and 1% reptiles, amphibians and other arthropods. In Kenya , the relative occurrence of food items found in scats was 74% seeds and fruit (more than 40 species) versus 82% arthropods and 44% other food remains (small mammals, reptiles, birds, snails, and leaves). In Nigeria , stomach contents contained small mammal species ( Praomys tullbergi, Cricetomys sp., Mus musculoides, Lemniscomys striatus, Hybomys univittatus, Dendromus sp., Crocidura nigeriae, Crocidura poensis , and Crocidura sp. ), insects (including Orthoptera and Coleoptera), birds, eggs, reptiles, fruits, seeds, centipedes, and spiders; there was a 70% overlap in diet with the sympatric Crested Genet, indicating strong interspecific competition for food between these two species. Bats have been recorded as prey items in South Africa (Pipistrellus capensis and genera Eptesicus, Scotophilus, and Rhinolophus) and Somalia (genus Tadarida). There are reports of Rusty-spotted Genets killing poultry: in Zimbabwe , stomach contents included domestic fowl (pheasants, young peafowl, pigeons, and chickens). There is little evidence that carrion is eaten, although some stomachs from South Africa did contain maggots. Rusty-spotted Genets forage both in trees and on the ground. Prey is caught by careful stalking, followed by a pounce. Before being killed,its prey is bitten several times or sometimes shaken. Activity patterns. Mainly nocturnal. In Kenya and Ethiopia , radio-collared genets were more active between sunset and sunrise than during daylight hours. Restsites include trees, hollow logs, under tree roots, in disused Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) or spring hare burrows, under boulders, rock overhangs, caves, and man-made shelters. Resting sites are reused by both sexes. On following pages: 17. Pardine Genet ( Genetta pardina ); 18. Aquatic Genet ( Genetta piscivora ); 19. King Genet ( Genetta poensis ): 20. Servaline Genet ( Genetta servalina ): 21. Hausa Genet ( Genetta thierry), 22. Cape Genet ( Genetta tigrina ); 23. Giant Genet ( Genetta victoriae ). Movements, Home range and Social organization. Generally solitary, except pairs are seen during the breeding season. A radio-tracking study in Kenya (June-August), found mean home ranges of 5-9 km? for three males and 2: 8 km ” for two females; male ranges overlapped those of females. Males may move at 3 km /hour. Often seen on the ground, but also regularly observed climbing in trees; it can descend headfirst and usesits tail as a balancing organ. Uses regular latrine sites; some ground latrines are shared by other genet and mongoose species. Territories are marked using the perineal gland secretion, urine, and feces (with anal gland secretions). Tree scratching also may play a role in marking. A threatening attitude is achieved by arching the back and erecting the hairs on the back and tail. Breeding. Two breeding peaks have been reported from Kenya : a main peak from October to December and another between March and May. In southern Africa, it appears that the breeding season extends from August to March. In South Africa , three young were found in February and two pregnant females, both with three fetuses, were recorded in November. Three two-week-old kittens were found in a hollow tree in northern Namibia in October. In Botswana , a female was found lactating during February and in Zimbabwe births were recorded from August to February. In Zambia , four-week-old juveniles were taken in October and November. Breeding behavior has been observed in captivity. A courting male, after sniffing the vulva of the female, exhibits a facial grimace (flehmen). He follows the female closely and produces grumbling and coughing calls. During the early stages of courtship, the female keeps turning away from the male, with hertail and hindquarters low, and flees. She eventually answers the male’s calls and allows him to come into close contact. Each partner then sniffs the other’s face and genitals, and they rub their cheeks. The female holds her tail up and crouches with raised hindquarters and tail deflected sideways. The male then clasps the female on the groin area, with his chest and belly resting on her lower back. As the female curves her spine, intromission occurs with pelvic thrusting. The male may sometimes bite the neck of the female during the final seconds of copulation, which usually lasts five minutes. Coupling pairs often meow. After copulating, the female may anal-drag and roll on her back, and both partners lick their genitals. Gestation is 70-77 days. Litter size appears to be two to five. Births take place in hollow trees, nests of leaves, and under roofs in urbanized habitats. Neonates are blind; they are covered with hair and have a discernable coat pattern. The eyes open at ten days and the first set of canines erupts at four weeks. These are shed after the permanent canines have erupted, at around 10-11 months. The mother licks her kittens ano-genitally and consumes their excrement. The young begin to take solid food at about six weeks, and may start to kill and eatlive vertebrates at about 28 weeks. At approximately eight weeks of age, the young start running, jumping, rolling, and playing fighting games. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Considered unthreatened as it has a wide range and occurs in a number of habitats. However, it may be declining in some areas due to hunting: it is found in bushmeat markets and is frequently trapped. Rusty-spotted Genets have a bad reputation as poultry thieves and farmers sometimes poison or trap them in retaliation. Bibliography.

The posterior extension of the frontal bone is very narrow and the posterior chamber of the auditory bulla has a continuous curve line on the external side. The premaxillary-maxillary suture is at the same level as P! and the maxillary-palatine suture is at the same level as the main cusps of P*-M, (reduced). Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. Habitat. Rainforest. Nearly all specimens were trapped near small rivers and some were collected in forests dominated by limbali trees (Gilbertiodendron). Found from 460 to 1500 m . Food and Feeding. Thought to be semi-aquatic and to primarily eat fish; natives say that fish is the favored prey. The stomach of one specimen contained bones of a small fish and an entire catfish ( Clariidae ) about 10 cm in length. The dentition may be adapted to dealing with slippery prey and the bare palms may be an adaptation for feeling and handling fish in muddy holes. Also reported to feed on crustaceans, but this is considered unlikely by some authors. Two captive adults never ate frogs, tadpoles, or crabs, but a young animaltried to eat all three. None showed any interest in moths or beetles that flopped into the pools in their enclosure. Small pools, or slowly flowing brooks, were approached with an extremely slow, gliding stalk. As the animal moved slowly along the water’s edge, the surface was alternately tested with the vibrissae and patted with the forefoot. The wrist was bent back almost to the vertical and the surface struck with a downward pivoting action. Insect-eating fish such as barbel (Barbus, up to 30 cm ), catfish ( Clarias ), squeaker (Synodontis), and Labio were caught with a rapid, open-mouthed strike, and carried away. Activity patterns. Thought to be crepuscular and nocturnal. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Considered solitary. Has been caught in snare-traps set on the ground. Breeding. A pregnant female was collected in late December with a single foetus, which was about 15 mm in length. A captive male made very aggressive tom-cat-like meows when pursuing a female and trying to mate. A chuffing call is used between individuals. Status and Conservation. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Mostly known from museum specimens (around 30) and considered among the rarest of the African carnivores. Has been given complete protection by the DR Congo government. Major threats are unclear, but Aquatic Genets are hunted for bushmeat by Bambuti pygmies. This speciesis a high priority for field studies to better understand its ecology, distribution, and population status. Bibliography.

Giant Genet Genetta victoriae French: Genette géante / German: Riesengenette / Spanish: Gineta gigante Taxonomy. Genetta victoriae Thomas, 1901 , type locality debated: Uganda or Zaire . Monotypic. Distribution. DR Congo and W Uganda . Descriptive notes. Head-body 55-60 cm, tail 41:3—-49 cm, hindfoot 9.2-10. 5 cm , ear 4.5-5. 1 cm ; weight 2.5-3. 5 kg . A large genet. Both sexes are similar in color and size. The coat color ranges from yellowish to ochraceous-white; the ventral pelage is paler. There is a pair of wide nuchal stripes and a nuchal crest. The dark mid-dorsal line is discontinuous, but has long hairs that give it a continuous appearance; these hairs form an erectile dorsal crest. The dorsal spots are small and randomly distributed. The face has a dark mask and a pair of supraand sub-ocular white spots. The tail has about six pale rings alternating with dark rings. The width of the pale rings relative to the dark rings in the middle of the tail is less than 20%; the tip of the tail is dark. The hindlimbs and forelimbs are brown to black. There is one pair of teats. The posterior chamber of the auditory bulla is ventrally inflated, with a continuous curve line on the external side. The premaxillary-frontal contact is present and the maxillary-palatine suture is just behind the main cusp of P2. The ratio between the inter-orbital constriction and frontal width is less than 1 + 0-12. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. Habitat. Rainforest. Ranges up to 2000 m . Ecological niche modelling has predicted potential suitable regions in lowland forests in Cameroon , southwestern Central African Republic , northern Gabon , and north-western PR Congo (plus a small area of swamp forest between the PR Congo and the DR Congo ). Deciduous forest and woodlands in southern DR Congo and Angola , and patches of deciduous forest and woodland in Tanzania , northern Zambia , and Uganda , also offer possible habitat. Its apparent absence west of the Congo and Oubangirivers might be due to lack of survey effort, low dispersal abilities, or riverine geographical barriers. Food and Feeding. Nothing known. Activity patterns. Appears to be nocturnal: a single animal was observed trotting along a forest road at about 22:30 h, and a captive individual was only active at night. Reported to sleep in hollow trunks of dead trees or among vines. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Thought to be solitary. Breeding. Nothing known. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. A poorly known species and field studies are needed. There are no known major threats, but it is hunted for bushmeat and skins, which are used to make hats and other ceremonial objects. Bibliography.

A small civet with a dark mask and long tail. The coat color is gray, grayish-brown or rusty; the body spots and stripes are brown or black. The head pattern is very variable, but generally consists of a dark mask, with white or pale gray patches below the eyes, on the forehead, and at the bases of the ears. Variations include: a muzzle with white nose patches, ear and forehead patches that are fused, facial patches that are very small, and facial patterns that are absent or very faint. The rhinarium is large and has a deep groove in the middle. There are black spots along the back that merge to form three lines, which run longitudinally from the shoulders to the base of the tail. The spots on the flanks are well separated, but tend to be in rows. This pattern is variable and can be obscure in some populations; on Borneo and the Philippines , the whole body can be dark brown or black, and the stripe pattern is indistinguishable. In the northern parts of the range, the length of the guard hairs seems to vary seasonally; when the pelage is long, the coat pattern tendsto be faint. Some individuals have faint rings at the base of the tail, and the tail tip can sometimes be white or yellow. The feet have five digits. The metapodial pads are large and not well separated from the plantar pads. They cover the whole sole and the area between them is naked. On the hindfoot, the third and fourth digit pads are fused at their base. The perineal gland is simple and consists of a naked elongated area. There are three pairs of teats, but the third pair is reduced. The skull is long and low, with prominent post-orbital processes, low crests, a rising rather than flat zygomatic arch, and a marked post-orbital constriction. The posterior chamber of the auditory bullae is ovoid and extends anteriorly, covering largely the anterior chamber. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The carnassials have reduced shearing blades. Sometimes the upper carnassial is short and triangular, with a strong postlingual cingulum; it also can be elongated and narrower, with a reduced post-lingual cingulum. The shape of the premolars and molars is variable. The first premolars are reduced; the second and third premolars are rather simple and pointed. The teeth of old individuals are often very worn.","A wide range of habitats, including evergreen and deciduous forest (primary and secondary), plantations, and around human dwellings and settlements. Found up to 2400 m . In Thailand , one radio-collared male moved through an area that constituted 44% dry dipterocarp forest, 30% mixed deciduous forest, and 26% dry evergreen forest; another male moved within 55% dry dipterocarp forest, 32% dry evergreen forest, and 12% mixed deciduous forest.","Mainly frugivorous, but also eats small vertebrates and invertebrates. On Borneo, specimen stomachs contained 90% arthropods and 45% fruits and leaves (no vertebrate remains were found). In Nepal , 193 scats contained 85% fruits; insects, molluscs, small reptiles, birds, and small mammals were also included in the diet. The major source of fruit was Coffea benghalensis (from mid-December to February) and Bridelia stipularis (in March and April). All scats contained fruits during the fruiting seasons. When ripe fruits were not available, the diet shifted to small vertebrates and invertebrates. Field observations showed that they also fed on the nectar of Bombax ceiba and sap from the stems of Vallaris solanacea. In India , scats contained 83% fruits (including 23% papaya, Carica papaya), rodents (Roof Rats Rattus rattus, House Mice Mus musculus, and Indian Gerbils Tatera indica ), and insects (beetles and cockroaches). Common Palm Civets sometimes drink the juice (called “toddy’) from tapped coconut palms, hence the local colloquial name “Toddy Cat” for this species. Activity patterns. Nocturnal. Camera-traps and field sightings have recorded this species as active during the night. In Thailand , radio-collared individuals were active over 50% of the time between 16:30 h and 04:30 h, with a peak between 19:30 h and 01:30 h. In Nepal , an adult female was active 79% of the time during the hours of darkness, and five other radio-tracked individuals were active from 18:00-04:00 h; they were more active on darker nights, and none of them left their resting sites when there was a full moon. Common Palm Civets rest in trees, choosing the tallest and largest tree in their immediate area at the onset of daylight. They rest more often in trees covered with dense vines (63%) than in trees with holes (21%) or without vines or holes (16%). Trees with vines or holes were used for several consecutive days, but those without these features were not. Common Palm Civets are also known to sleep in buildings. They rest alone, except for females with young. In Myanmar ,rest sites were usually in tall trees (greater than 10 m in height) that had dense tangles of climbing plants (e.g. lianas). In shrubby areas, rest sites are in a tangle of shrubs (sometimes surrounding a tall tree), 2-3 m above the ground. About 45% ofrestsites were used once only; one site was used 55 times over a period of 294 days. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary. Mainly arboreal, but can be active on the ground. In Nepal , a radio-collared adult female had a home range of 0-12 km? In another study in Nepal , three males had home ranges of 0-17, 0-17, and 0-20 km?, and two females had home ranges of 0-06 and 0-12 km*. Home ranges were smaller during February and June, when the fruits of Coffea benghalensis and Murraya koeniggii were abundant, and largest in March to May, when ripe fruits were clumped or scarce. There was considerable overlap of home ranges among adjacent civets, but this changed according to food availability; more overlap was observed when ripe fruiting trees were at low density or clumped in distribution. In Thailand , the home ranges of two males were 4-2 and 17 km ?: a shift in the range of the latter male occurred during the study. Mean daily movements were from 660 m to 1 km . In another study in Thailand , two males had home ranges of 1-1 and 3-4 km*, and a female had a home range of 1-4 km? The mean daily movement was 0-43 km for males and 0-48 km for the female.

Common Palm Civets deposit scats on the ground and on tree branches. Breeding. Breeding seems to occur throughout the year, although young are more frequently seen between October and December. Littersize is two to five. The female often gives birth in a hollow tree. In Nepal , a female palm civet was captured in May with five young, estimated to be a week old; they were found in a den within a hollow tree. In captivity, gestation is 61 to 63 days. The eyes of neonates are closed and they weigh 69-102 g. They attain sexual maturity at 11-12 months.","CITES Appendix III ( India ). Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. P. h. lignicolor (Mentawai Islands, Indonesia ) is classified as Vulnerable. The subspecies kangeanus (Kangean Islands, Indonesia ) and P. h. lignicolor are listed as Threatened in the 1989 IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids. Although widespread and generally considered common (even in disturbed habitats), on Borneo, it was found that the overall density of civets (including this species) in a logged forest was found to be significantly lower than in a primary forest. Common Palm Civets are often considered pests by fruit farmers and are killed. They are also trapped and traded for meat. Common Palm civets are kept as pets and used as rat catchers, which may explain why they were introduced to several areas. They may be under threat on the Mentawai Islands due to forest loss from commercial logging. Field surveys and ecological studies are needed to ascertain their distribution and conservation status, particularly on small islands on which they are known to occur.","Abegg (2003) | Austin & Tewes (1999b) | Azlan (2003, 2005) | Bartels (1964) | Blanford (1885a, 1885b) | Corbet & Hill (1992) | Davis (1962) | Dhungle & Edge (1985) | Duckworth (1997) | Goldman (1982) | Grassman (1998c) | Groves (1984) | Heydon & Bulloh (1996) | Holden (2006) | Joshi, Smith & Cuthbert (1995) | Krishnakumar & Balakrishnan (2003) | Krishnakumar et al.

In India , scats contained 83% fruits (including 23% papaya, Carica papaya), rodents (Roof Rats Rattus rattus, House Mice Mus musculus, and Indian Gerbils Tatera indica ), and insects (beetles and cockroaches). Common Palm Civets sometimes drink the juice (called “toddy’) from tapped coconut palms, hence the local colloquial name “Toddy Cat” for this species. Activity patterns. Nocturnal. Camera-traps and field sightings have recorded this species as active during the night. In Thailand , radio-collared individuals were active over 50% of the time between 16:30 h and 04:30 h, with a peak between 19:30 h and 01:30 h. In Nepal , an adult female was active 79% of the time during the hours of darkness, and five other radio-tracked individuals were active from 18:00-04:00 h; they were more active on darker nights, and none of them left their resting sites when there was a full moon. Common Palm Civets rest in trees, choosing the tallest and largest tree in their immediate area at the onset of daylight. They rest more often in trees covered with dense vines (63%) than in trees with holes (21%) or without vines or holes (16%). Trees with vines or holes were used for several consecutive days, but those without these features were not. Common Palm Civets are also known to sleep in buildings. They rest alone, except for females with young. In Myanmar ,rest sites were usually in tall trees (greater than 10 m in height) that had dense tangles of climbing plants (e.g. lianas). In shrubby areas, rest sites are in a tangle of shrubs (sometimes surrounding a tall tree), 2-3 m above the ground. About 45% ofrestsites were used once only; one site was used 55 times over a period of 294 days. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary. Mainly arboreal, but can be active on the ground. In Nepal , a radio-collared adult female had a home range of 0-12 km? In another study in Nepal , three males had home ranges of 0-17, 0-17, and 0-20 km?, and two females had home ranges of 0-06 and 0-12 km*. Home ranges were smaller during February and June, when the fruits of Coffea benghalensis and Murraya koeniggii were abundant, and largest in March to May, when ripe fruits were clumped or scarce. There was considerable overlap of home ranges among adjacent civets, but this changed according to food availability; more overlap was observed when ripe fruiting trees were at low density or clumped in distribution. In Thailand , the home ranges of two males were 4-2 and 17 km ?: a shift in the range of the latter male occurred during the study. Mean daily movements were from 660 m to 1 km . In another study in Thailand , two males had home ranges of 1-1 and 3-4 km*, and a female had a home range of 1-4 km? The mean daily movement was 0-43 km for males and 0-48 km for the female. Common Palm Civets deposit scats on the ground and on tree branches. Breeding. Breeding seems to occur throughout the year, although young are more frequently seen between October and December. Littersize is two to five. The female often gives birth in a hollow tree. In Nepal , a female palm civet was captured in May with five young, estimated to be a week old; they were found in a den within a hollow tree. In captivity, gestation is 61 to 63 days. The eyes of neonates are closed and they weigh 69-102 g. They attain sexual maturity at 11-12 months. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix III ( India ). Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. P. h. lignicolor (Mentawai Islands, Indonesia ) is classified as Vulnerable. The subspecies kangeanus (Kangean Islands, Indonesia ) and P. h. lignicolor are listed as Threatened in the 1989 IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation of Mustelids and Viverrids. Although widespread and generally considered common (even in disturbed habitats), on Borneo, it was found that the overall density of civets (including this species) in a logged forest was found to be significantly lower than in a primary forest. Common Palm Civets are often considered pests by fruit farmers and are killed. They are also trapped and traded for meat. Common Palm civets are kept as pets and used as rat catchers, which may explain why they were introduced to several areas. They may be under threat on the Mentawai Islands due to forest loss from commercial logging. Field surveys and ecological studies are needed to ascertain their distribution and conservation status, particularly on small islands on which they are known to occur. Bibliography.

There is a scarcity of recent records, especially from Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand , and little is known about current populations. As it is found primarily in lowland forest, particularly near streams and wetland areas, the loss of lowland forest within its range has probably reduced populations of this species and threatens its persistence. Riverine habitats are increasingly being polluted and disturbed. Selective logging may also be responsible for its apparent rarity: in northern Borneo, the abundance of civets was significantly lower in logged forest than in primary forest, with the most specialized civets (such as the Otter Civet), being less tolerant of logged forests than generalist civet species. Conversion of peat swamp forests to oil palm plantations is an additional threat. Field surveys and ecological studies are needed to ascertain its current distribution, to monitor populations, and to determineits tolerance to habitat disturbance.","Chen (1988) | Corbet & Hill (1992) | Davies & Payne (1982) | Goldman (1982) | Harrison (1974) | Heydon & Bulloh (1996) | Heydon & Ghaffar (1997) | Lekagul & McNeely (1991) | Payne et al.

The perineal gland is simple, consisting of an area of naked skin and openings (a pair of small depressions in the female and a series of median pores in the male). The skull is long and low, with only a slight sagittal crest and a flat zygomatic arch; there is a very slight post-orbital process and a low ascending ramus. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The canines are only a little longer than the premolars. The premolars are set close together and are triangular in shape, with high, pointed crowns; the molars are broad with low cusps. Habitat. Primary lowland dry forest, swamp forest, bamboo forest, and secondary forest. It has been recorded as high as 1200 m in Borneo, but most records are from lowland forest. The majority of field observations and camera-trap records are in the vicinity of water, near streams and swampy areas. Food and Feeding. Thought to be semi-aquatic and is said to feed on aquatic prey (small vertebrates and invertebrates). Activity patterns. May be nocturnal: several field observations were at dusk, at night, and in the early morning, and one camera-trap in Riau Province ( Indonesia ) recorded an Otter Civet at 03:20 h. However, camera-trapping in the Way Kambas National Park ( Sumatra ) recorded Otter Civets as active at all times of the day. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Terrestrial, but there is one camera-trap photograph showing an Otter Civet climbing a tree. Mainly solitary, but photographs of mothers with young have been recorded: of 59 camera-trap pictures in Sumatra , 53 were of single individuals, four were of two individuals, and two were of three individuals. Breeding. Females with two and three embryos have been recorded, and camera-traps have photographed females with one and two young. In captivity, the litter size has been reported to range from two to three. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Endangered on The [UCN Red List. Listed as Threatened in the 1989 IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation ofMustelids and Viverrids. Most museum specimens are from 1826 to 1940. There is a scarcity of recent records, especially from Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand , and little is known about current populations. As it is found primarily in lowland forest, particularly near streams and wetland areas, the loss of lowland forest within its range has probably reduced populations of this species and threatens its persistence. Riverine habitats are increasingly being polluted and disturbed. Selective logging may also be responsible for its apparent rarity: in northern Borneo, the abundance of civets was significantly lower in logged forest than in primary forest, with the most specialized civets (such as the Otter Civet), being less tolerant of logged forests than generalist civet species. Conversion of peat swamp forests to oil palm plantations is an additional threat. Field surveys and ecological studies are needed to ascertain its current distribution, to monitor populations, and to determineits tolerance to habitat disturbance. Bibliography.

The coat color varies from gray, light brown, or blond to dark brown; the underparts are paler. There are no stripes or spots on the body and tail. The facial mask generally consists of a median white stripe from the nose to the top of the head, bordered by large black patches on both sides. Below each eye is a small white patch and above there is a large white mark that extends to the base of the ear and beyond. In the northern regions, the white band on the nose can extend beyond the forehead to the neck and shoulders. In the Sundaic region, the facial mask can be almost absent or yellowish, with no distinct patches, or black and white pattern. The rhinarium is large and deeply grooved up to its dorsal surface. The distal end of the tail may be darker than the basal part, and sometimes has a whitishyellow tip. The feet have five digits and are blackish. The metapodial pads are large and wide. The plantar and metacarpal pads on the forefeet are clearly separated by ridges. The metatarsal pads on the hindfeet are long and partly fused anteriorly to the plantar pads; the depression in between is naked and covered by horny papillae. On the hindfoot, the third and fourth digit pads are fused at the base. There are two pairs of teats. The perineal gland is simple: it consists of a pair of thickened ridges of skin that form the walls of a longitudinal fossa (the external parts of the ridge are hairy and the inner sides are naked). The skull is quite similar to the Common Palm Civet, but is larger and wider. Dental formula: 13/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The teeth are small and low, and the blades on the carnassials are reduced. The premolars are small and separated from each other.","Primary evergreen and deciduous forest, and in disturbed habitats. Found up to 2500 m .

Figs were found to be the main food item in one specimen stomach collected from Borneo and in a scat collected from a trapped animal in Thailand ; Binturongs have been observed in fig trees frequently. One individual was photographed eating fallen jackfruit ( Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Sumatra. Activity patterns. In Thailand , radio-collared Binturongs were found to be arrhythmic; they were active 47% of the time and had activity peaks between 04:00-06:00 h and 20:00-22:00 h. Also in Thailand , two Binturongs were observed feeding at night (00:30 h and 03:30 h), but several diurnalfield observations were also reported: feeding animals were seen between dawn and early afternoon, with a peak active period from 06:30-08:00 h. In Sabah, Binturongs were seen almost as often by day as by night. On Sumatra, sightings were frequently reported during the day, but they were also cameratrapped at night. A captive female and two males showed an arrhythmic activity pattern: moving, feeding, and agonistic behavior were highest from 09:00-12:00 h, resting was highest from 00:00-03:00 h, and reproductive activities were more frequent from 03:00-06:00 h. Another captive male from Vietnam was found to be strictly nocturnal. Rest sites are in the upper branches oftall trees; when resting,it lies curled up, with the head tucked underthe tail. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, but sometimes females are seen with young. Arboreal, but will descend to the ground. Binturongs can climb trees with ease, but progress slowly and deliberately, using their long prehensile tails for balance and to hold branches for support. On the ground, they are plantigrade and walk along on the soles oftheir feet. In Thailand , five radio-collared males had a mean annual range size of 6-2 km? (range 4-7 to 7-7 km?); wet season ranges were larger. The home range overlaps were substantial (mean= 35%) indicating a lack of territories. The mean one-day movement distance was 688 m . In another study in Thailand , the home range of a female was 4-0 km? and 20-5 km? for a male (with a core area of 3-5 km?).

Captive Binturongs utter high-pitched whines and howls, rasping growls, and a variety of grunts and hisses when excited. Breeding. Breeding seems to occur throughout the year, at least in captivity. Captive females are non-seasonally polyoestrous and may give birth to twolitters annually; however, there is a pronounced birth peak from January to March. Littersize is one to six, most commonly two. Gestation is 84 to 99 days. Observations in captivity have shown that copulations usually take place in trees. Captive males and females had their first copulations between 13 and 48 months old. Both sexes remain fertile until 15 years old; the maximum lifetime productivity is estimated to be 23 young. The mean estrous cycle is 83 days. Copulations are observed during a period of up to 15 days, suggesting a long estrous period. During estrus, females increase their activity and calling; this call consists of a single blowing sound (made by expelling air through the nose) that is also emitted by males in adjacent cages. During encounters, the male follows the restless female, frequently sniffing both her and the cage. After mutual sniffing, the male investigates the female's perineal region and often exposes this area by pulling her tail aside with his forepaws; males often flehmen after licking the perineal region of the female. The female indicates her receptivity by emitting a coarse purring sound and incites the male to follow her by trotting briskly. She will then lie down and the male mounts by either standing on the female’s back, clasping her around the midbody with his forepaws, or by standing and straddling the female with his forelegs. Thrusting occurs in bouts and frequently alternates with periods of back licking; the female emits a continuous loud coarse purring noise during copulations. The female terminates copulations by quickly departing. The male remains at the copulation site and licks his penis; the female licks her perineal gland and vulva. After a pause, the female walks around the cage and initiates another mounting sequence. Mean newborn birth weight is 319 g , which is about 3% the weight of the mother. The young start to eat solid food at the age ofsix to eight weeks.","CITES Appendix III ( India ). Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Classified as Critically Endangered on the China Red List. Habitat loss and degradation could be a major threat: in South-east Asia, there has been forest loss and degradation through logging and conversion to non-forest land-uses. On Borneo, the overall density of civets (including the Binturong ) in logged forests was found to be significantly lower than in primary forests. In the Philippines , Binturongs are harvested for the pet trade. Hunting is a threat, particularly snaring, as they descend to the ground occasionally; in Vietnam , a Binturong was found in a snare-trap. There has been an increased demand for civet meat in Chinese and Vietnamese markets;it is considered particularly tasty in parts of Laos and civets are also taken for human consumption in southern areas. Binturongs are found in markets in Laos and skins are traded to Vietnam . They are hunted in north-east India , as civet oil is believed to have aphrodisiac properties. Field surveys, ecological studies, and assessments of threats are needed. In order to manage captive breeding programs of this species, there is a Population Management Plan in American zoos and a European Studbook Programme in European zoos.","Arivazhagan & Thiyagesan (2001) | Austin (2002) | Austin & Tewes (1999b) | Azlan (2003) | Corbet & Hill (1992) | Cosson et al.

On the hindfeet, the divisions between the plantar pads, metatarsal pads, and the medial depression also are not well defined. The naked area on the foot extends to the back of the heel, which is covered by horny pointed papillae. On the hindfoot, the third and fourth digit pads are fused at their base. The claws are strong, sharp and retractile, but are unguarded by lobes of skin. There are two pairs of teats. The perineal gland is simple and consists of a pair of haired labia. The skull is large and not constricted in the post-orbital area. Dental formula: I 3/3, C1/1,P 4/4, M 2/2 = 40. The teeth are quite small, with the shearing blades of the carnassials reduced, and the incisors well separated. Habitat. Primary and secondary forest, including grassland/forest mosaic. Found up to 1500 m on Borneo, and from 700 to 2500 m on Sumatra. In north-east India ,it is restricted to dense tropical and subtropical forests up to 2000 m . Food and Feeding. Said to feed on small vertebrates, invertebrates, and fruits, but 1s believed to be predominantly frugivorous. Figs were found to be the main food item in one specimen stomach collected from Borneo and in a scat collected from a trapped animal in Thailand ; Binturongs have been observed in fig trees frequently. One individual was photographed eating fallen jackfruit ( Artocarpus heterophyllus) in Sumatra. Activity patterns. In Thailand , radio-collared Binturongs were found to be arrhythmic; they were active 47% of the time and had activity peaks between 04:00-06:00 h and 20:00-22:00 h. Also in Thailand , two Binturongs were observed feeding at night (00:30 h and 03:30 h), but several diurnalfield observations were also reported: feeding animals were seen between dawn and early afternoon, with a peak active period from 06:30-08:00 h. In Sabah, Binturongs were seen almost as often by day as by night. On Sumatra, sightings were frequently reported during the day, but they were also cameratrapped at night. A captive female and two males showed an arrhythmic activity pattern: moving, feeding, and agonistic behavior were highest from 09:00-12:00 h, resting was highest from 00:00-03:00 h, and reproductive activities were more frequent from 03:00-06:00 h. Another captive male from Vietnam was found to be strictly nocturnal. Rest sites are in the upper branches oftall trees; when resting,it lies curled up, with the head tucked underthe tail. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Solitary, but sometimes females are seen with young. Arboreal, but will descend to the ground. Binturongs can climb trees with ease, but progress slowly and deliberately, using their long prehensile tails for balance and to hold branches for support. On the ground, they are plantigrade and walk along on the soles oftheir feet. In Thailand , five radio-collared males had a mean annual range size of 6-2 km? (range 4-7 to 7-7 km?); wet season ranges were larger. The home range overlaps were substantial (mean= 35%) indicating a lack of territories. The mean one-day movement distance was 688 m . In another study in Thailand , the home range of a female was 4-0 km? and 20-5 km? for a male (with a core area of 3-5 km?). Captive Binturongs utter high-pitched whines and howls, rasping growls, and a variety of grunts and hisses when excited. Breeding. Breeding seems to occur throughout the year, at least in captivity. Captive females are non-seasonally polyoestrous and may give birth to twolitters annually; however, there is a pronounced birth peak from January to March. Littersize is one to six, most commonly two. Gestation is 84 to 99 days. Observations in captivity have shown that copulations usually take place in trees. Captive males and females had their first copulations between 13 and 48 months old. Both sexes remain fertile until 15 years old; the maximum lifetime productivity is estimated to be 23 young. The mean estrous cycle is 83 days. Copulations are observed during a period of up to 15 days, suggesting a long estrous period. During estrus, females increase their activity and calling; this call consists of a single blowing sound (made by expelling air through the nose) that is also emitted by males in adjacent cages. During encounters, the male follows the restless female, frequently sniffing both her and the cage. After mutual sniffing, the male investigates the female's perineal region and often exposes this area by pulling her tail aside with his forepaws; males often flehmen after licking the perineal region of the female. The female indicates her receptivity by emitting a coarse purring sound and incites the male to follow her by trotting briskly. She will then lie down and the male mounts by either standing on the female’s back, clasping her around the midbody with his forepaws, or by standing and straddling the female with his forelegs. Thrusting occurs in bouts and frequently alternates with periods of back licking; the female emits a continuous loud coarse purring noise during copulations. The female terminates copulations by quickly departing. The male remains at the copulation site and licks his penis; the female licks her perineal gland and vulva. After a pause, the female walks around the cage and initiates another mounting sequence. Mean newborn birth weight is 319 g , which is about 3% the weight of the mother. The young start to eat solid food at the age ofsix to eight weeks. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix III ( India ). Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Classified as Critically Endangered on the China Red List. Habitat loss and degradation could be a major threat: in South-east Asia, there has been forest loss and degradation through logging and conversion to non-forest land-uses. On Borneo, the overall density of civets (including the Binturong ) in logged forests was found to be significantly lower than in primary forests. In the Philippines , Binturongs are harvested for the pet trade. Hunting is a threat, particularly snaring, as they descend to the ground occasionally; in Vietnam , a Binturong was found in a snare-trap. There has been an increased demand for civet meat in Chinese and Vietnamese markets;it is considered particularly tasty in parts of Laos and civets are also taken for human consumption in southern areas. Binturongs are found in markets in Laos and skins are traded to Vietnam . They are hunted in north-east India , as civet oil is believed to have aphrodisiac properties. Field surveys, ecological studies, and assessments of threats are needed. In order to manage captive breeding programs of this species, there is a Population Management Plan in American zoos and a European Studbook Programme in European zoos. Bibliography.

On Borneo, the frequency of occurrence of prey items found in twelve stomachs was: 656% insects (including Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoteran larvae, and ants), 22% earthworms, 9% other arthropods (spiders, pedipalps, centipedes, millipedes, and crabs), 2% molluscs, and 1% amphibians (toads and frogs). No fruits or other plants were found, except fragments of dead leaves and pieces of rotten wood. Based on its diet, it appears to forage mainly on the forest floor and along stream banks. Activity patterns. Data from camera-traps and field observations indicate it is nocturnal. In captivity, is active when the enclosure is in the dark. Said to rest in hollow logs or in tree holes. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Appears to be terrestrial: has been captured and camera-trapped on the ground, three specimens were shot along forest streams, and its diet suggests that it forages on the forest floor. However,it is also believed to be partly arboreal: it climbs well in captivity, one live animal was found in a hole in a large tree, and another was trapped 8 m above the ground. Captive animals have been observed scent marking by rubbing the perineal gland onto a solid surface; this was more common in males than females. While in a defensive, agitated, or startled state, a civet may squirt an oily spray from the perineal gland (from a standing position and with a sudden quick lift of the tail). Breeding. A pregnant female with one foetus was recorded from Borneo in February. In captivity, litter size has been reported as one to two. One newborn female weighted 125 g and measured 25 cm . Newborns are scarcely able to crawl, their eyes are closed, and the ears are folded. The eyes open between eight and twelve days. The young start walking at around 18 days and can climb trees at four weeks. At four months, one young female weighed 1050 g and was 76 cm long. At ten weeks, the young start to eat on their own. At six months, they are adultsized. The adult orange buff coloration on the neck and belly appears when the young civets are sexually mature. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The Mentawai subspecies are listed as Threatened in the 1989 IUCN Action Plan for the Conservation ofMustelids and Viverrids. Habitat loss and degradation are major threats. In South-east Asia, there has been loss and degradation offorests (particularly lowland forests), through logging and conversion to other land-uses. Although the Banded Palm Civet has been recorded in disturbed forests, on Borneo, the overall density of civets (including this species) in a logged forest was found to be significantly lower than in a primary forest. Hunting and trade could also be threats. Field surveys, ecological studies, and assessments of threats are needed. Bibliography.
