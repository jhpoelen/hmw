The Northern Bottlenose Whale is the only beaked whale where there is evidence that adult males are consistently larger than adult females.

Unlike many other species of beaked whales, Northern Bottlenose Whales, even older males, do not accumulate white linear scars resulting from intraspecific aggression. Rostrum and lower jaw form a short but well-defined beak, and there are two grooves on the throat. Shape of forehead is notably sexual dimorphic. In young males and females, forehead is rounded and similar to that of the bottlenose dolphins (7ursiops spp.). As males mature, forehead becomes enlarged and flattened due to growth of bony crests on maxillary bones of the skull. When fully mature, heads of adult males can rise almost vertically from the beak. With maturity, pigmentation of skin on the front of the forehead may become reduced until it becomes a pale white in the oldest males. Unlike many other species of beaked whales, adult males have no functional teeth and lack tusks that are one of the most distinctive features of the family Ziphiidae .","Deep oceanic waters and generally in areas where water depths are greater than 500 m. Northern Bottlenose Whales appear to favor areas with complex seabed topography and are most commonly recorded in canyons along shelf margins, around oceanic islands, or around seamounts. Northern Bottlenose Whales may be yearround residents in some locations. In others, there is evidence of large-scale seasonal movements. In particular, a large number of individuals seem to move into the Norwegian Sea in early spring and summer and move out again in late summer and early autumn. Its not known where these individuals go, but seasonal patterns of strandings around the Faroe Islands, UK, and the Republic of Ireland suggest that they may move through the Faroe-Shetland channel and into the Atlantic Frontier region to the west of the British Isles. During these movements, it is not uncommon for some individual Northern Bottlenose Whales to stray into shallower shelf waters, where they may remain for extended periods of time before either leaving or stranding.","Primary prey of the Northern Bottlenose Whale throughout most of its distribution is the squid Gonatusfabricii, but they consume a wide range ofspecies of deep-water squid, and deep-water fish are not uncommon in the diet in some locations. They primarily consume a very narrow range of prey sizes. Most prey is 0-5-6% of an individual whale’s total body length. Prey capture is almost certainly achieved through suction feeding. Information from dive tags suggests that most foraging of Northern Bottlenose Whales occurs at or near the seabed and that they spend ¢.67% of theirlife at water depths greater than 1000 m. Individual dives are commonly longer than 30 minutes and may last more than an hour.","Northern Bottlenose Whales become sexually mature at a body length of ¢.600 cm for females and c.730 cm for males when they are 7-8 years old. Gestation lasts for ¢.12 months, and a single offspring is born at a length of ¢.300-350 cm. Weaning is thought to occur after one year, and there may be a minimum of two years between births. Nothing is known of the courtship behavior of Northern Bottlenose Whales, but it appears that males engage in aggressive interactions that involve head butting, and this may be the function of the large maxillary crests found in adult males. Males also appear to form long-term alliances, but it is not known how this relates to mating. Northern Bottlenose Whales maylive as long as 37 years, with males possibly living longer than females.","There is no specific information available for this species, but the majority of their time is spent foraging at depths greater than 500 m.","Some populations of Northern Bottlenose Whales, such as the one found in and around the Gully (a submarine canyon off the east coast of Nova Scotia, Canada), are known to be resident, but there is evidence of large-scale seasonal movements in other areas, such as the Norwegian Sea. Movements of individuals have only been studied in the population found in the Gully. Individuals studied remain resident in this area for extended periods of time; however, it is not known how representative this population is of the species as a whole. Northern Bottlenose Whales usually occur in small groups of 1-4 individuals, with a maximum group size of¢.20 individuals. Studies ofthe social organization of the Gully population suggest that it has a social system similar to that of some populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ), where males form long-term stable alliances and females form loose and more fluid associations. Nevertheless, it is not known how representative thisis of the species as a whole. Evidence from whaling suggests that a tight social bond can exist among individuals in a single group, with other whales coming to the aid of a harpooned individual.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. There are no estimates of global population size of Northern Bottlenose Whales, although estimates are available from some regions. A population of ¢.40,000 individuals has been estimated for the eastern North Atlantic as a whole, with estimates ofjust over 3000 individuals for Icelandic waters and just under 300 for Faroese waters. However,it is not clear how reliable these estimates are due to difficulties associated with conducting surveys for deep-diving species that spend prolonged periods of time below the surface. An isolated population of ¢.160 individuals is known to occur around the Gully off Nova Scotia. Commercial whalers hunted Northern Bottlenose Whales, and more than 65,000 were killed between the mid-1800s when they were first targeted and 1977 when whaling for this species was banned. By then, the global population may have been as low as 30% ofits pre-whaling size. It is now estimated to have rebounded to ¢.60% of that size, but it is thought that many subpopulations are still depleted. Small numbers of Northern Bottlenose Whales are still killed in traditional drive fisheries in the Faroe Islands from time to time. Although whaling was the main conservation issue for Northern Bottlenose Whales in the past, at present other known or potential impacts are of more concern. These include damage to deep-water ecosystems from fishing and noise pollution from shipping and military activities. Impacts of such activities on oceanic species are difficult to study and quantify, and it is not currently known how great a threat they are to Northern Bottlenose Whales as a species or to individual populations or subpopulations within their distribution.

It has been taken in small numbers by whalersin several parts of the world, including Japan, but has never been the target of a full-scale commercial fishery. It is one of the main species that has been affected by mass strandings associated with the use of mid-frequency military sonars, which may have conservation implications for local populations. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales may also be affected by overfishing of deep-water ecosystems. They occasionally occur as bycatch in driftnet fisheries. Plastic debris is commonly recorded in the stomachs of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. In some parts of the world, such as the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean,as many as 80% of individuals contain plastic debris at the time of death. This plastic can cause erosion to the stomach lining and has been implicated in the deaths of several individuals. Nevertheless, effects of these impacts on oceanic species are difficult to study and quantify, and it is not currently known how great a threat they are to Cuvier’s Beaked Whales as a whole or to individual populations or subpopulations.","Baird et al.

Cuvier’s Beaked Whale Ziphius cavirostris French: Baleine-a-bec de Cuvier / German: Cuvier-Schnabelwal / Spanish: Zifio de Cuvier Other common names: Goose-beaked Whale , Goosebeak Whale Taxonomy. Ziphius cavirostrnis G. Cuvier, 1823 , France, “dans le département des Bouches-du-Rhone, entre de Fos et I’embouchure du Galégeon” (= between Fos and the mouth of the Galégeon River). No subspecies are currently recognized, but further research may reveal genetic differences between populations in different ocean areas. Monotypic. Distribution. All warm temperate to tropical waters of the world and perhaps in cooler waters in the Southern Ocean and the N Pacific Ocean. It is the only species of beaked whales that commonly occurs in the Mediterranean Sea. Descriptive notes. Total length 600-700 cm; weight 2500-3500 kg. Body of Cuvier’s Beaked Whale is spindle-shaped, with greatest girth around its midpoint. Flukes are wide in relation to body length, and tailstock is compressed laterally. Dorsalfin is small and set approximately two-thirds the distance between tip of the beak and end of the tail. Coloration is typically dark brown or dark gray. Adults of both sexes may have paler heads. In adult males, the pale head is usually very distinct, and a pale patch extends backward from it as far as the dorsal fin. Dorsal surface of adult males may also be covered in pale linear scars that are concentrated between head and dorsal fin. Rostrum and lower jaw form a short beak that is barely distinguishable from the bulbous forehead; there are two grooves on the throat. Adult males have a pair of conical tusksat the tip of the lowerjaw that may become worn down as far as the gums in older individuals. On following pages: 4. Northern Bottlenose Whale ( Hyperoodon ampullatus ); 5. Southern Bottlenose Whale ( Hyperoodon planifrons ); 6. Shepherd's Beaked Whale ( Tasmacetus shepherd). Habitat. Deep, oceanic waters and generally in areas where water depths are more than 500 m. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales appearto favor areas with complex seabed topography and are most commonly recorded in canyons along the shelf margins, around oceanic islands, or around seamounts. Food and Feeding. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales primarily prey on deep-water squid, but they may consume deep-water crustaceans in some parts of their distribution. They primarily consume a very narrow range of prey sizes, with most prey being 0-5-7% of an individual whale’s total body length, with a clear mode at 2-3%. Prey capture is almost certainly achieved by suction feeding. Information from dive tags suggests that most foraging of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales occurs at or near the seabed and that they spend ¢.67% oftheir life at water depths greater than 1000 m. Individual dives are commonly longer than 30 minutes and may last more than an hour. Breeding. Cuvier’'s Beaked Whales become sexually mature at a body length of ¢.580 cm for females and ¢.550 cm for males. Gestation lasts ¢.12 months, and a single offspring is born at a length of ¢.270 cm. Weaning is thought to occur after one year; there may be a minimum of two years between successive offspring for individual females. Nothing is known of their courtship behavior, but it appears that males engage In aggressive interactions, using their tusks, which results in high levels of scarring on the dorsal surface from the head to as far back as the dorsal fin. Activity patterns. There is no specific information available for this species, but the majority of their time is spent foraging at depths greater than 500 m. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Although little is known about movements or home ranges of individual Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, the same individuals have been encountered in the same area repeatedly over several years, which suggests that there is some degree ofsite fidelity. There is evidence of seasonal movements in some parts of the world, such as the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean. In other places, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales appear to be present throughout the year. They typically occur in small groups of one to five individuals, and groups of more than ten are rare. Some groups consist solely of females and their offspring, but a single adult male may also be present in some groups. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, but the Mediterranean subpopulation is classified as Data Deficient. There are no estimates of the global population size of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, although estimates are available from some regions. For example, a population of ¢.80,000 individuals has been estimated for the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and c.15,000 for the waters around Hawaii. This would suggest that Cuvier’s Beaked Whale is one of the most abundant species of beaked whale in these regions.

Endemic to subtropical and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean in an area ranging from N USA to Brazil and from Ireland to Guinea-Bissau; its distribution may continue as far S as Uruguay in the W, and possibly as far S as Angola in the E. It is occasionally recorded stranding in temperate waters, but these may represent vagrant individuals. Descriptive notes. Total length 420-485 cm; weight ¢.800 kg (unconfirmed). Gervais’s Beaked Whale is one of the few species of beaked whales where females are larger than males, although this difference is relatively small: females are only 6% longer than males. Body is spindle-shaped, with greatest girth around its midpoint. Flukes are wide in relation to body length, and tailstock is compressed laterally. Dorsal fin is small and set approximately two-thirds the distance between tip of the beak and end of the tail. Coloration is typically dark brown, dark gray, or black and paler underneath. There may be a white patch around the genitalslit in some adult females. Rostrum and lower jaw form a beak thatis indistinct from the low, sloping forehead. There are two grooves on the throat. Adult male Gervais’s Beaked Whales have a single triangular tusk on each side of the lower jaw. Tusks are positioned close to but not at tip of mandible. Adult males may have long, linear pale scars on their backs that are caused by tusks of other males during male-male combat. Habitat. Primarily waters greater than 200 m deep. Occurrence of Gervais’s Beaked Whale may be linked to areas of complex seabed topography. Food and Feeding. Little is known about the diet of Gervais’s Beaked Whales. In common with other species of beaked whales, they are thought to consume deep-water squid and,to a lesser extent, deep-water fish. They may also be one of the few species of beaked-whales that commonly consume deep-water crustaceans. Breeding. Almost nothing is known about the reproductive biology of Gervais’s Beaked Whale. Females give birth to a single offspring after gestation that is likely twelve months. Offspring are likely dependent on their mothers for at least one year. Individuals may live as long as 48 years. Activity patterns. There is no information available for this species. Movements, Home range and Social organization. There is no specific information available for this species, but they are known to occur in small groups that typically consist of fewer than five individuals. Nothing is known about the typical composition of these groups. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The [UCN Red List. There are no estimates of global population size of Gervais’s Beaked Whale. Like other species of beaked whales, Gervais’s Beaked Whale is potentially affected by ingestion of plastic debris and noise pollution, and it may be caught as bycatch in driftnet fisheries. Nevertheless, nothing is known about the form or extent of these potential impacts. Bibliography. Macleod (2006), MacLeod & D'Amico (2006), MacLeod et al. (2006), Mead (1989b), Norman & Mead (2001)."

Distribution of Sowerby’s Beaked Whaleis restricted to cooler waters, and most records come from waters cooler than 15°C. Food and Feeding. Sowerby’s Beaked Whale is one of the few species of beaked whales that seems to primarily consume deep-water fish rather than deep-water squid. It is known to take a wide range of bentho-pelagic fish, including deep-water gadoids. Almost all of its prey is 1-6% of an individual’s total body length, with a clear mode at 2-3%. In common with other species of beaked whales, feeding likely occursat great depth, often over 500 m and possibly as deep as 3000 m or more. Foraging dives may be up to an hourin length. Breeding. Little is known about breeding in Sowerby’s Beaked Whale. Although unconfirmed,it is thought that reproduction is seasonal, with offspring born in spring or summer, and that gestation is twelve months. Activity patterns. There is no information available for this species. Movements, Home range and Social organization. There is no specific information available for this species, but as with other species of Mesoplodon , Sowerby’s Beaked Whale is seen in small groups, typically of five individuals or less, and groups larger than ten individuals are rarely encountered. Small groups tend to consist of females and immature individuals with one adult male. Larger groups may contain more than one adult male. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The [UCN Red List. There are no estimates of global population size of Sowerby’s Beaked Whale. It is one of the most commonly encountered species of Mesoplodon within much ofits distribution. As with other species of beaked whales, Sowerby’s Beaked Whale may be at risk from climate change, noise pollution, bycatch by driftnetfisheries, and ingestion ofplastic debris. Nevertheless, nothing is known about the form or extent of these potential impacts. Bibliography. Hooker & Baird (1999b), Macleod (2006), MacLeod & DAmico (2006), MacLeod, Perrin et al.

This species is monotypic.","Araguaia-Tocantins Basin in the Brazilian states of Goias, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, and Para.","Few data available, but body measurements from individuals below and above Tucurui Dam fall into the range of other botos; the largest individual male recorded was 236 cm long (n = 9) and the largest female 201 cm (n = 12). One individual found at Curuca Estuary was 252 cm in total length. Like the other species of botos, the Araguaian Boto is strongly sexually dimorphic with adult males larger, more robust, more pink and with a more “ragged” appearance than females. Newborn and young individuals are dark gray; adults are lighter gray and with pinkish coloration below. The main differences between the skull of the Araguaian Boto and that of the two other species of botos are the larger biparietal width: males 8:1.9-2 cm (mean 8-7 cm, n = 2) and females 9.6-11.5 cm (mean 10-6 cm, n = 2), and larger greatest width of maxillaries (females 11.3-11.8 cm, mean 11:6 cm, n = 2). The length of the rostrum is 68% oftotal length of the skull in males and 66% in females, but based on measurements ofjust two animals of each sex. Number of teeth may be slightly less than in the Amazon River Dolphin, with total number per row ranging 24-28 (n = 3) teeth. Each upper and lower tooth row has 6-8 molar-type teeth on both sides.","The Araguaia River is a floodplain river with sinuous bed and muddy waters from the substantial sediment load. During the peak of the dry season (July/August) the depth of the river is dramatically reduced, exposing extensive sandbanks. The Tocantins River, however, is embanked, with relatively clear water, several rapids and a faster current. Botos occurin all habitats in this river, but highest densities occur (both during the seasons of low and falling water) in confluences and bays.","Very little information is available for this species, but accounts of fishermen and observations of Araguaian Botos stealing fish from hooks and nets and pursuing schools of fish in an apparently cooperative way confirm the piscivorous diet of the species, similar to that of the two other species of botos. One study reported three species of fish seen in the mouths of Araguaian Botos: Hydrolycus armatus (Characiformes), and Pimelodus blochii and Oxydoras niger (both Siluriformes) of estimated size of 80 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm respectively. Large catfish (over 60 cm) were found floating dead with boto teeth marks and missing chunks of the posterior part of the body torn out by botos.","There is no specific information available for this species, but it is likely similar to the Amazon River Dolphin. Lactating females were recorded in the months ofJuly, August, and September without reference to the size of their young. Two halfgrown fetuses were collected in August, several years apart.

In the Araguaia River singletons are predominant but 3-4 dolphins are not uncommon, and larger aggregations can occur around a resource or at a confluence or bay. During low water, groups of botos drive schools of fish toward sandbanks and into very shallow water, where they are captured. Surveys above the Tucurui Dam revealed that even after the area was flooded, botos tended to aggregate in places where confluences and bays previously existed, suggesting a strong fidelity to the area. Other characteristics of their movements and social organization are likely similar to the Amazon River Dolphin.","Because of its recent description, the Araguaian Boto has not yet been formally evaluated on The IUCN Red List. However, due to population-level threats and fragmentation of the population by dams, the species conforms to IUCN criteria designating it as Vulnerable. The Araguaian Boto has a restricted distribution, with fragmented habitat and population, and low population size when compared to the Amazonian River Dolphin. Animal densities of only 0-8-0-98 ind/km* have been reported, and the species appears to have low levels of genetic diversity. In addition to the seven large dams that have been built in the Tocantins River (Tucurui, Luiz Barreto, Lajeado, Peixe Angical, Sao Salvador, Cana Brava, and Serra da Mesa) and two new large dams planned (Serra Quebrada and Maraba) which divide the boto population into nine fragments, agricultural and ranching activities cause cumulative negative effects on several biotic and abiotic aspects of the river basin ecosystem. After 1984, the Tucurui Dam, 11 km long and 78 m high, totally isolated the Araguaian Boto population, stopping its contact with botos from the Para River and estuary about 350 km below. Before the construction of the dam, botos were recorded above and below the rapids and falls that existed in the area, all flooded bythe reservoir. So, potentially, the species can also occur below the Tucurui Dam and its confluence with the Para River to near Soure on the east side of Marajo Island. Recent analysis of mtDNA for a specimen from Para State revealed a different and isolated geographic form of boto, genetically distant from the Amazonian River Dolphin and the Bolivian Boto. In the Tocantins River, the most upstream and southerly records were well above the rapids near Jatobal as well as below and above the hydroelectric dam of Serra da Mesa, near Uruacu and rivers Lajeado and Manoel Alves, among others. In the Araguaia River, the Araguaian Boto has been recorded between the city of Aragarcas/Barra do Garcas and the southern part of Bananal Island past the city of Luis Alves to Santa Isabel rapids and down to Maraba, and in tributaries such as the Formoso, Cristalino, Vermelho, Peixe, Crixas Acu, and Agua Limpa rivers, as well at lakes dos Tigres and Rico in Goias State, up to the confluence with the Tocantins River, and also in Lake Montaria in Mato Grosso State.

Araguaian Boto Inia araguaiaensis French: Boto de I'Araguaia / German: Araguaia-Delfin / Spanish: Delfin del Araguaia Taxonomy. Inia araguaiaensis Hrbek et al., 2014 , “entrance of Lake Jurumirim” Araguaia River, State of Goias. This species is monotypic. Distribution. Araguaia-Tocantins Basin in the Brazilian states of Goias, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, and Para. Descriptive notes. Few data available, but body measurements from individuals below and above Tucurui Dam fall into the range of other botos; the largest individual male recorded was 236 cm long (n = 9) and the largest female 201 cm (n = 12). One individual found at Curuca Estuary was 252 cm in total length. Like the other species of botos, the Araguaian Boto is strongly sexually dimorphic with adult males larger, more robust, more pink and with a more “ragged” appearance than females. Newborn and young individuals are dark gray; adults are lighter gray and with pinkish coloration below. The main differences between the skull of the Araguaian Boto and that of the two other species of botos are the larger biparietal width: males 8:1.9-2 cm (mean 8-7 cm, n = 2) and females 9.6-11.5 cm (mean 10-6 cm, n = 2), and larger greatest width of maxillaries (females 11.3-11.8 cm, mean 11:6 cm, n = 2). The length of the rostrum is 68% oftotal length of the skull in males and 66% in females, but based on measurements ofjust two animals of each sex. Number of teeth may be slightly less than in the Amazon River Dolphin, with total number per row ranging 24-28 (n = 3) teeth. Each upper and lower tooth row has 6-8 molar-type teeth on both sides. Habitat. The Araguaia River is a floodplain river with sinuous bed and muddy waters from the substantial sediment load. During the peak of the dry season (July/August) the depth of the river is dramatically reduced, exposing extensive sandbanks. The Tocantins River, however, is embanked, with relatively clear water, several rapids and a faster current. Botos occurin all habitats in this river, but highest densities occur (both during the seasons of low and falling water) in confluences and bays. Food and Feeding. Very little information is available for this species, but accounts of fishermen and observations of Araguaian Botos stealing fish from hooks and nets and pursuing schools of fish in an apparently cooperative way confirm the piscivorous diet of the species, similar to that of the two other species of botos. One study reported three species of fish seen in the mouths of Araguaian Botos: Hydrolycus armatus (Characiformes), and Pimelodus blochii and Oxydoras niger (both Siluriformes) of estimated size of 80 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm respectively. Large catfish (over 60 cm) were found floating dead with boto teeth marks and missing chunks of the posterior part of the body torn out by botos. Breeding. There is no specific information available for this species, but it is likely similar to the Amazon River Dolphin. Lactating females were recorded in the months ofJuly, August, and September without reference to the size of their young. Two halfgrown fetuses were collected in August, several years apart. Apparent neonates have been observed year-round. Activity patterns. There is no specific information available for this species, but due to the strong seasonal variation in the water level, and fish movements during the transition from high to low waters, Araguaian Botos must move from lagoons and flooded areas to main river channels, as do the other species of botos. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Group size varies seasonally and usually is between one and three individuals.

Botos living in the Orinoco Basin have been recognized as a subspecies, the “Orinoco Boto” (humboldtiana), by some authors, but movement of dolphins between this and the adjacent Amazon Basin is very likely to occur. Monotypic.","Most of the Orinoco and Amazon basins in Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador.","Total length 219-255 cm (males) and 182-225 cm (females); weight 113.5-207 kg (males) and 72-154 kg (females). Botos are the largest of all river dolphins. Amazon River Dolphins are highly sexually dimorphic, with adult males longer and heavier than females. Mature adult males often have “cobblestoning” skin modifications on pectoral fins and tailstock. These are related to fighting and may be a form of scar tissue or a shield or weapon. Body of the Amazon River Dolphin is corpulent and heavy but extremely flexible, capable of bending and twisting. Young are dark gray and became lighter with age. Adults can be from uniform pink to uniform dark gray, but usually grayer above and pinker below. Adult males are more pink than females and become pinker with age. The difference of body color between sexes is greater than in any other cetacean, with pinkness of males perhaps advertising size and strength in sexual display. Rostrum is prominent and robust, with short bristles on top and below the jaw. Eyes are small and inconspicuous, but vision is good. Amazon River Dolphins have two different types of teeth: conical and molartype. Total number of upper jaw teeth range from 23-35 (mean 26-6) and the lower jaw from 24-35 (mean 27-1). Each upper and lower mandible has 7-9 molar-type teeth on both sides. Melon is relatively small and flaccid and can be altered in shape by muscular control. Pectoral fins are large, broad, thick, paddle-like, and capable of desynchronized movements, allowing botos to swim backward and in shallow places. Flukes are broad, thick, and triangular in shape. Dorsal fin is not falcate (curved), but laterally flattened and like a dorsal keel extending from the mid-body to the strongly keeled caudal peduncle.","Freshwater, in waterways from the upper reaches of the Amazon and Orinoco to just above the brackish waters of their estuaries. Botos can swim in water shallower than 2 m and come very close to the shore c.1 m depth. Most Amazon River Dolphins live in areas of low gradient, where annual cycles of water depth produce profound habitat changes. For half the year, Amazon River Dolphins have access to vast areas of inundated floodplain, much of it consisting of a complex mosaic of forest, lakes, and channels. This habitat is characterized by low current and high fish density, providing a safe environment, especially for young individuals. Occupied rivers, lakes, and channels vary substantially in character. Some have acidic, black water emanating from flooded forests. Others have clear water originating in geologically old drainage basins. Many have white water laden with sediments from the Andes. Fish communities vary among these ecosystems, but Amazon River Dolphins feed on a wide variety of fish species. Seasonal changes in precipitation and water depth dominate habitats of botos. Major rivers and channels retain adequate water for Amazon River Dolphins throughout the year, but many of the smaller channels and lakes cannot be relied on to retain water in the dry season, so botos and most fish abandon them for several months of the year. The flexible body and broad, rotatable flippers of Amazon River Dolphins, together with the lack of a “normal” falcate dorsal fin, are adaptations for swimming in the tangled vegetation of the flooded forest.","The heterodont (more than one type of tooth) dentition of all three species of botos, unique in cetaceans, allows them to capture and crush armored prey such as armored catfish, crabs, and, on occasion, turtles. Fish dominates the diet of all botos. More than 50 fish species, representing more than 20 families, have been found in the stomachs of Amazon River Dolphins in the Central Amazon area, Brazil, including freshwater fish of benthic, littoral, and pelagic habits. Fish of 5-80 cm in length (average c.20 cm) are consumed. Prey diversity is greater at high water levels when botos have access to flooded forests.","Births of botos in Central Amazon, Brazil, occur throughout the year, with a small peak in the low-water season. Length of gestation is not accurately known, but it is probably 11-12 months. Littersize is always one. Neonates are 80-90 cm long and c.10-13 kg at birth. They remain with their mothers for at least two years. Simultaneous pregnancy and lactation are not uncommon, and reproductivciy active mature females spend most of their lives accompanied by a dependent offspring.","There is limited evidence of diurnal activity patterns of Amazon River Dolphins from echolocation click density and movements, but presence or absence of light is arguably unlikely to be of profound importance because botos live in waters where visibility and light penetration are usually very low. Indeed,vision is not essential to their well-being, and a substantial number of healthy botos have opaque eye lenses (cataracts).","Studies of Amazon River Dolphins in Brazil have relied on the resightings of individuals or, in one case, close-range detection of radio signals from marked individuals. Therefore, long-range movements are almost certainly underrepresented but are likely to occur. Daily movements of up to 20 km are normal, with sustained swimming speeds of 3-6 km/h. About half of Amazon River Dolphins at the entrance of the Mamiraua Lake system in the central Brazilian Amazon were “residents,” defined as being seen there in at least seven months of the year, and 90% of the botos seen inside the system met that definition. The “non-residents” demonstrated a range offidelity to the area, with some (among the hundreds marked permanently with freeze-brands) never being encountered again. Seasonal changes in water level and availabilities of habitats resulted in major local movements of botos on a scale of a few tens of kilometers, but they did not change overall numbers of botos in a local area. Similarly, no larger-scale migrations of Amazon River Dolphins are known or suspected, and there are no obvious reasons for such population-level movements.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red Lust. Population sizes and trends are inadequately known. The Amazon River Dolphin is distributed throughout most of the Amazon Basin, and it occurs in and near the main stem of the Orinoco River and its largest tributary, the Apure River. It has been reported in smaller rivers of the Orinoco River system and may occur at low densities throughout this basin. Amazon River Dolphins do not occupy salty or brackish waters, but they are tolerant of a wide variety of types of freshwater and habitats. Shallow water, impassable rapids, and availability of food likely limit distribution of the Amazon River Dolphin. Total population size is unknown, but it is likely tens of thousands or more. In the year 2000, 13,000 Amazon River Dolphins were estimated to occur in an area of ¢.11,240 km? in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in the central Brazilian Amazon. Encounter rates are ¢.0-6 ind/km of waterway, and most botos in the major rivers occur near the margins. Estimated density of Inia in the Amazon River in Colombia (Loretoyacu and Javari rivers) was 1-8 ind/km? in an area of 593 km?, giving a total population estimate of 1115 botos. In Peru, in the Samiria River and a stretch of the Maranon River between the city of Iquitos and the confluence with the Samiria River, densities were 2.7 ind/km? and 5-9 ind/km? in an area of 554 km?, and estimated population size of 917 botos. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, in the rivers Napo, Cuyabeno, Yasuni, Lagartococha, and Aguarico in a surveyed area of 144 km?®, the population size estimate was 147 botos; encounter rates ranged 0-03-0-4 ind/km®. In the Orinoco River estimated density was 1-1 ind/km?* and population size 1779 in a surveyed area of 1684 km. The Amazon River Dolphin has been widespread and abundant, despite loss of many individuals (probably thousands) per year to entanglement and drowning in monofilament gillnets,first introduced in the 1960s and now used by almost every riverside household in the region. Young and juvenile botos were, and remain, especially vulnerable. Since 2000, standardized monitoring of abundance of Amazon River Dolphins in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve detected a marked increase in mortality and the beginning of a steady decline in boto abundance. This coincided with reports of the deliberate killing of botos for use as fish bait. Botos are used as bait to catch an abundant scavenging catfish, the zamurito (Calophysus macropterus, Siluriformes), which is widely distributed in the Amazon River Basin. One person can catch hundreds of catfish in a single night, with no equipment other than a large box to hold the catch and a supply of suitable bait. As stocks of catfish diminished in Colombia, this method offishing was exported downriver into Brazil, and today botos from the Brazilian Amazon are harpooned and often sold specifically for bait in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Brazil. Hunting botos is illegal, clandestine, and almost impossible to quantify. Nevertheless, the approximate size of the catfish catch is known, and calculations of the ratio of botos used per ton of catfish landed, derived from the communities involved, indicates that across its distribution, thousands of Amazon River Dolphins are killed each year in pursuit of this one fishery. In some places, the impact of this hunt on the overall population of Amazon River Dolphins appears to be profound. The hunt continues unabated, and the population continues to decline at an annual rate of ¢.10%. The Amazon River Dolphin is steeped in folklore legends. River-dwelling communities in Brazil fear and revere the Amazon River Dolphin, which is reputed to transform into a man under cover of darkness and seduce women, thereby explaining unexpected pregnancies in human fishing communities. Supposed body parts of Amazon River Dolphins are bought as love charms in Amazonian markets, but DNA analyses have revealed that these are rarely accurately labeled, at least in recent times. Most derive from domestic pigs and sheep, and the Guiana Dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), an ocean dolphin.","Aliaga-Rossel et al.

Amazon River Dolphin Inia geoffrensis French: Boto de Amazone / German: Amazonas-Delfin / Spanish: Delfin del Amazonas Other common names: Boto , Bufeo , Pink River Dolphin; Orinoco Boto , Orinoco Bufeo (Orinoco population) Taxonomy. Delphinus geoffrensis de Blainville, 1817 , “sur la cote du Brésil,” probably upper Amazon of Brazil. Botos living in the Orinoco Basin have been recognized as a subspecies, the “Orinoco Boto” (humboldtiana), by some authors, but movement of dolphins between this and the adjacent Amazon Basin is very likely to occur. Monotypic. Distribution. Most of the Orinoco and Amazon basins in Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. Descriptive notes. Total length 219-255 cm (males) and 182-225 cm (females); weight 113.5-207 kg (males) and 72-154 kg (females). Botos are the largest of all river dolphins. Amazon River Dolphins are highly sexually dimorphic, with adult males longer and heavier than females. Mature adult males often have “cobblestoning” skin modifications on pectoral fins and tailstock. These are related to fighting and may be a form of scar tissue or a shield or weapon. Body of the Amazon River Dolphin is corpulent and heavy but extremely flexible, capable of bending and twisting. Young are dark gray and became lighter with age. Adults can be from uniform pink to uniform dark gray, but usually grayer above and pinker below. Adult males are more pink than females and become pinker with age. The difference of body color between sexes is greater than in any other cetacean, with pinkness of males perhaps advertising size and strength in sexual display. Rostrum is prominent and robust, with short bristles on top and below the jaw. Eyes are small and inconspicuous, but vision is good. Amazon River Dolphins have two different types of teeth: conical and molartype. Total number of upper jaw teeth range from 23-35 (mean 26-6) and the lower jaw from 24-35 (mean 27-1). Each upper and lower mandible has 7-9 molar-type teeth on both sides. Melon is relatively small and flaccid and can be altered in shape by muscular control. Pectoral fins are large, broad, thick, paddle-like, and capable of desynchronized movements, allowing botos to swim backward and in shallow places. Flukes are broad, thick, and triangular in shape. Dorsal fin is not falcate (curved), but laterally flattened and like a dorsal keel extending from the mid-body to the strongly keeled caudal peduncle. Habitat. Freshwater, in waterways from the upper reaches of the Amazon and Orinoco to just above the brackish waters of their estuaries. Botos can swim in water shallower than 2 m and come very close to the shore c.1 m depth. Most Amazon River Dolphins live in areas of low gradient, where annual cycles of water depth produce profound habitat changes. For half the year, Amazon River Dolphins have access to vast areas of inundated floodplain, much of it consisting of a complex mosaic of forest, lakes, and channels. This habitat is characterized by low current and high fish density, providing a safe environment, especially for young individuals. Occupied rivers, lakes, and channels vary substantially in character. Some have acidic, black water emanating from flooded forests. Others have clear water originating in geologically old drainage basins. Many have white water laden with sediments from the Andes. Fish communities vary among these ecosystems, but Amazon River Dolphins feed on a wide variety of fish species. Seasonal changes in precipitation and water depth dominate habitats of botos. Major rivers and channels retain adequate water for Amazon River Dolphins throughout the year, but many of the smaller channels and lakes cannot be relied on to retain water in the dry season, so botos and most fish abandon them for several months of the year. The flexible body and broad, rotatable flippers of Amazon River Dolphins, together with the lack of a “normal” falcate dorsal fin, are adaptations for swimming in the tangled vegetation of the flooded forest. Food and Feeding. The heterodont (more than one type of tooth) dentition of all three species of botos, unique in cetaceans, allows them to capture and crush armored prey such as armored catfish, crabs, and, on occasion, turtles. Fish dominates the diet of all botos. More than 50 fish species, representing more than 20 families, have been found in the stomachs of Amazon River Dolphins in the Central Amazon area, Brazil, including freshwater fish of benthic, littoral, and pelagic habits. Fish of 5-80 cm in length (average c.20 cm) are consumed. Prey diversity is greater at high water levels when botos have access to flooded forests. Breeding. Births of botos in Central Amazon, Brazil, occur throughout the year, with a small peak in the low-water season. Length of gestation is not accurately known, but it is probably 11-12 months. Littersize is always one. Neonates are 80-90 cm long and c.10-13 kg at birth. They remain with their mothers for at least two years. Simultaneous pregnancy and lactation are not uncommon, and reproductivciy active mature females spend most of their lives accompanied by a dependent offspring. Activity patterns. There is limited evidence of diurnal activity patterns of Amazon River Dolphins from echolocation click density and movements, but presence or absence of light is arguably unlikely to be of profound importance because botos live in waters where visibility and light penetration are usually very low. Indeed,vision is not essential to their well-being, and a substantial number of healthy botos have opaque eye lenses (cataracts). Movements, Home range and Social organization. Studies of Amazon River Dolphins in Brazil have relied on the resightings of individuals or, in one case, close-range detection of radio signals from marked individuals. Therefore, long-range movements are almost certainly underrepresented but are likely to occur. Daily movements of up to 20 km are normal, with sustained swimming speeds of 3-6 km/h. About half of Amazon River Dolphins at the entrance of the Mamiraua Lake system in the central Brazilian Amazon were “residents,” defined as being seen there in at least seven months of the year, and 90% of the botos seen inside the system met that definition. The “non-residents” demonstrated a range offidelity to the area, with some (among the hundreds marked permanently with freeze-brands) never being encountered again. Seasonal changes in water level and availabilities of habitats resulted in major local movements of botos on a scale of a few tens of kilometers, but they did not change overall numbers of botos in a local area. Similarly, no larger-scale migrations of Amazon River Dolphins are known or suspected, and there are no obvious reasons for such population-level movements. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red Lust. Population sizes and trends are inadequately known. The Amazon River Dolphin is distributed throughout most of the Amazon Basin, and it occurs in and near the main stem of the Orinoco River and its largest tributary, the Apure River. It has been reported in smaller rivers of the Orinoco River system and may occur at low densities throughout this basin. Amazon River Dolphins do not occupy salty or brackish waters, but they are tolerant of a wide variety of types of freshwater and habitats. Shallow water, impassable rapids, and availability of food likely limit distribution of the Amazon River Dolphin. Total population size is unknown, but it is likely tens of thousands or more. In the year 2000, 13,000 Amazon River Dolphins were estimated to occur in an area of ¢.11,240 km? in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in the central Brazilian Amazon. Encounter rates are ¢.0-6 ind/km of waterway, and most botos in the major rivers occur near the margins. Estimated density of Inia in the Amazon River in Colombia (Loretoyacu and Javari rivers) was 1-8 ind/km? in an area of 593 km?, giving a total population estimate of 1115 botos. In Peru, in the Samiria River and a stretch of the Maranon River between the city of Iquitos and the confluence with the Samiria River, densities were 2.7 ind/km? and 5-9 ind/km? in an area of 554 km?, and estimated population size of 917 botos. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, in the rivers Napo, Cuyabeno, Yasuni, Lagartococha, and Aguarico in a surveyed area of 144 km?®, the population size estimate was 147 botos; encounter rates ranged 0-03-0-4 ind/km®. In the Orinoco River estimated density was 1-1 ind/km?* and population size 1779 in a surveyed area of 1684 km. The Amazon River Dolphin has been widespread and abundant, despite loss of many individuals (probably thousands) per year to entanglement and drowning in monofilament gillnets,first introduced in the 1960s and now used by almost every riverside household in the region. Young and juvenile botos were, and remain, especially vulnerable. Since 2000, standardized monitoring of abundance of Amazon River Dolphins in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve detected a marked increase in mortality and the beginning of a steady decline in boto abundance. This coincided with reports of the deliberate killing of botos for use as fish bait. Botos are used as bait to catch an abundant scavenging catfish, the zamurito (Calophysus macropterus, Siluriformes), which is widely distributed in the Amazon River Basin. One person can catch hundreds of catfish in a single night, with no equipment other than a large box to hold the catch and a supply of suitable bait. As stocks of catfish diminished in Colombia, this method offishing was exported downriver into Brazil, and today botos from the Brazilian Amazon are harpooned and often sold specifically for bait in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Brazil.

This species is monotypic.","N Atlantic, ranging from feeding areas used from spring to autumn (including Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, and as far N as Nova Scotia) to the latewinter birthing grounds along the SE coast of North America (off Florida and Georgia), as well as sightings in the Gulf of Mexico and off Bermuda to the S; there are occasional records from Greenland, Iceland, and Norway. In the E Atlantic, historical records range S to Cintra Bay (23° N), Western Sahara.","Total length 1500-1650 m; weight up to ¢.70,000 kg. As is true of the other species of right whales, the North Atlantic Right Whale is of enormous size. All species in the family Balaenidae are sexually dimorphic, with females growing slightly larger than males. It is generally black. Some individuals may have white areas ventrally on throat and abdominal region. Blubber layer is very thick, ¢.15-20 cm. Stout and stocky, girth of the North Atlantic Right Whale may be greater than 60% of total length. Proportionately large head can be roughly one-third of body length. Blowhole openings, positioned posteriorly on head, are widely separated from one another and angle slightly to the sides, causing spout to form a V-shaped spray 5 m high. Rostrum is narrow, elongate, and markedly arched. There are ¢.200-270 (average 250) thin baleen plates, each ¢.300 cm long. Baleen is gray-brown to black or and is fringed with long, fine, gray bristles. Lower lips form a pronounced arc, closing over baleen on each side of rostrum. Eyes are located just above apex of mouth on either side. Callosities are present on head in patterns that vary among individuals but in generally consistent locations, including behind blowhole, along rostrum, above eyes, on chin, and along mandibles. Hair sometimes grows in areas with callosities. Amphipod crustaceans, “whale lice,” belonging to the family Cyamidae commonly inhabit the callosities and feed on whale skin. Callosities are naturally gray or black but develop a white, yellow, or orange tint depending on the species of whale lice ( Cyamus ovalis , C. gracilis, or C. erraticus) inhabiting them. Male North Atlantic Right Whales generally have proportionally greater areas covered by callosities than females. There is no dorsal fin or ridge on the wide, smooth back. Flippers are relatively large, broad, and paddle-shaped, with angular leading edges. There is a deep notch between wide (up to ¢.30% oftotal body length), gently curving flukes.","Temperate waters of coastal regions, including shallow basins, areas over the continental shelf, and deeper areas over the continental slope. Availability of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus is considered an important factor in habitat suitability of North Atlantic Right Whales. Interestingly, although C. finmarchicus is dormant throughout the Gulf of Maine during winter, North Atlantic Right Whales apparently continue to prey on them at great depths in smaller regional basins. Young copepods develop during onset of the seasonal thermocline and the spring phytoplankton bloom into late-stage copepodites and adults by late spring. Data on prey species and oceanographic parameters have been used to model habitat suitability for North Atlantic Right Whales on a weekly timescale in Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel of the North Atlantic Ocean, and they demonstrated that habitat use patterns change seasonally. Inclusion of prey as a variable was an important factor in model accuracy; presence of C. finmarchicus was most influential to habitat suitability in winter and spring. Such habitat modeling allows prediction of whale presence on a real-time basis and may be important to conservation efforts. During the birthing season in winter, pregnant females are often observed in relatively sheltered, shallow coastal regions in their southern distribution. For pregnant females, presence of prey may be a less important factor in habitat selection than winter oceanographic conditions. As in other mysticete species, there is some evidence of maternal habitat fidelity in North Atlantic Right Whales and indication of learned habitat selection. Offspring learn suitable habitat in the company of their mothers, returning to those habitats in subsequent years.","The North Atlantic Right Whale feeds mainly on calanoid copepods, most commonly C. finmarchicus. Documented prey items also include Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages spp., barnacle larvae, juvenile euphausiids, and a variety of nektonic plankton. The North Atlantic Right Whale is a skim feeder, swimming slowly with mouth open through densely concentrated swarms of prey, closing the mouth occasionally to flush out water. Feeding occurs at the water’s surface and, more frequently, deep below the surface. Feeding near the seafloor also apparently occurs occasionally. Generally, whales skimming with their mouths open at the surface, stop, closing their mouths, after having reached the end of a prey patch. Whales feeding at depth breath in c.10-15minute intervals, and thus their mouth-closing actions are more regular. Feeding dives commonly last c.10-20 minutes.","Some details of reproduction have been very well documented for the North Atlantic Right Whale, based on long-term studies using photo-identification of individuals. Long-term research over a period of several decades has shown fluctuation in its reproductive rate and birth intervals (time period between successive births for a single female). Birth intervals of North Atlantic Right Whales increased from an average of three years between births during the 1980s to more than five years by the late 1990s. Mean age of female maturity increased from approximately seven to nine years of age during the same period of study, and there was a significant decline in number of offspring produced per mature females during this time (mean percentage of offspring per mature female was 0-25%). In 2000-2005, however, birth rate increased; in previous decades, annual production of offspring for the population averaged twelve individuals annually, but then increased to 31, 29, 19, 16, and 28 offspring/year from 2001 to 2005, respectively. Right whales, in general, are thought to reach sexual maturity at body lengths of 1300-1400 cm. Courtship behavior is observed throughout the year on both birthing and feeding grounds, but fertile breeding is thought to be seasonal, with most births occurring from late December to March, with a peak in early January. Gestation is thought to be ¢.12-13 months, as has been determined for the Southern Right Whale (FE. australis ). A single young is born. Neonates are 400-550 cm long and weigh ¢.800 kg. Observations of live births of North Atlantic Right Whales at sea are extremely rare. Two live births were opportunistically observed and documented during aerial survey work in recent years. Fetal folds may be observed in newborns. Pale gray areas on head and rostrum of newborns where callosities will develop may be apparent but are smooth; they will become thickened during the first few months after birth, perhaps due, at least in part, to habitation by whale lice. Cyamids have not been observed in the callosities of newborns. Duration of lactation is 8-17 months, and it is thought that most young are weaned within their first year. Growth is rapid, with offspring reaching at least ¢.900 cm at weaning. Post-weaning growth may slow markedly until the young whale is of sufficient size and feeding ability to forage efficiently. Maximum age for North Atlantic Right Whales is not known, in part because of the difficulty of developing reliable age-determination methodologies for baleen whales, but photoidentification has placed one individual at a minimum of 70 years of age.","Right whales, in general, are commonly slow moving and occasionally rest at the surface for long periods. Nevertheless, the North Atlantic Right Whale is frequently observed engaged in active surface behavior, including breaching, lobtailing, flipper slapping, and raising flukes proceeding deep dives. It also has been observed to be very tactile, touching and rubbing conspecifics.","In the spring, North Atlantic Right Whales, predominately females with newborns and subadults (non-breeding females and most males may remain in northern areas throughout the year), move northward along the east coast of North America from late-winter birthing grounds off Florida and Georgia to late-spring and autumn, near-shore feeding grounds with cooler ocean temperatures and higher biological productivity. These feeding areas include certain basin areas within the Gulf of Maine, Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts Bay, Great South Channel, lower Bay of Fundy, and as far north as Nova Scotia. By summer and autumn, North Atlantic Right Whales are generally observed in the Bay of Fundy between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and at sites on the continental shelf of Nova Scotia. There may also be feeding grounds farther offshore and to the north. Regional movements between summer feeding grounds may be common and can be far-ranging. Longitudinal photo-identification studies of North Atlantic Right Whales in combination with satellite telemetry data collected from individuals equipped with radio tags in the Bay of Fundy over the last several decades have augmented visual survey data to reveal long-distance excursions. Individual movements from feeding grounds have proven to be highly variable. Some individuals moved extensively around the Gulf of Maine, Nova Scotia Shelf, northern Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the continental slope. Some radio-tagged individuals made trips exceeding 2000 km before returning to feeding grounds in the Bay of Fundy. Pregnant female North Atlantic Right Whales and many subadults leave feeding grounds in late autumn and move southward to warmer birthing grounds. Thus, there is apparent regional segregation during winter, with only part of the population present on birthing grounds. Adult females that are not giving birth have generally not been observed on birthing grounds, and adult males are generally absent. Location of these mature whales is uncertain, and it is also uncertain if this non-birthing segment of the population is aggregated elsewhere or scattered in areas of the North Atlantic Ocean. Results of recent demographic modeling, based on past survey work and comparisons of known individuals from photo-identification catalogues, suggest that significantly higher proportions of both known fathers and known conceptive females were present in whale aggregations in the Gulf of Maine during the winter breeding season compared with most other areas seasonally inhabited by right whales during this period. The work is not conclusive, but it may suggest that regions of the Gulf of Maine (and potentially other northern areas) are a mating ground for North Atlantic Right Whales. Although large aggregations may be observed on birthing and feeding grounds, North Atlantic Right Whales are commonly found alone, in pairs, or in small groups.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The North Atlantic Right Whale was found historically on both sides of the Atlantic, and it was considered to have consisted of two populations. The eastern North Atlantic population, which is now functionally extinct,is thought to have ranged from Cintra Bay (c.23° N), a once important winter birthing ground along the coast ofthe Western Sahara to the Bay of Biscay and northward to North Cape, Norway. Population designation for individuals occasionally observed during recent years in Iceland and Norway is undetermined. In the western North Atlantic, the population of the North Atlantic Right Whale was estimated at 490 individuals in 2010. The last assessment of this population for The IUCN Red List classified it as Endangered in 2008 when the population was believed to number only 300-350 individuals along the east coast of North America. Although a roughly 1-6% increase in reproductive rate has been observed in recent years (documented in 2001 and 2005), the increase is not enough to compensate for the estimated 2% annual decline in population size that had occurred over previous decades. No original pre-whaling population estimate is available for North Atlantic Right Whales off North America, but the low estimate for the number killed between 1634 and 1951 is 5500 individuals, and it is possible that twice that number were killed. Major threats to the North Atlantic Right Whale along the east coast of North America today, are ship strikes and bycatch in different types of fishing gear. Between 1970 and 2009, 38 North Atlantic Right Whales were recorded to have been killed in vessel collisions, and 31 were killed from fishery entanglements. These numbers are not sustainable given the small population size of the North Atlantic Right Whale. Examination of photographs of 626 individuals, taken between 1980 and 2009, indicated that c.83% had scars from being entangled in fishing gear at least one time and 59% had marks from having been entangled more than once. Subadults were entangled at a higher rate than adults. Low-frequency noise produced by ships masks naturally occurring sounds and causes habitat displacement, behavioral changes, ad-Justments in vocalizations, and increased levels of physiological stress. Vessel and sonic activity associated with oil and gas exploration are also known to expose large whales to detrimental noise levels. Other threats including low genetic variability, poor nutrition, chemical contaminants, biotoxins, and disease appear to be minor compared with ship strikes and entanglements. On following pages: 2.

North Atlantic Right Whale Eubalaena glacialis French: Baleine noire / German: Atlantik-Nordkaper / Spanish: Ballena franca del Atlantico Other common names: Biscayan Right Whale , Black Right Whale , Nordcaper , Northern Right Whale Taxonomy. Balaena glacialis Müller, 1776 , North Cape, Norway. This species is monotypic. Distribution. N Atlantic, ranging from feeding areas used from spring to autumn (including Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, and as far N as Nova Scotia) to the latewinter birthing grounds along the SE coast of North America (off Florida and Georgia), as well as sightings in the Gulf of Mexico and off Bermuda to the S; there are occasional records from Greenland, Iceland, and Norway. In the E Atlantic, historical records range S to Cintra Bay (23° N), Western Sahara. Descriptive notes. Total length 1500-1650 m; weight up to ¢.70,000 kg. As is true of the other species of right whales, the North Atlantic Right Whale is of enormous size. All species in the family Balaenidae are sexually dimorphic, with females growing slightly larger than males. It is generally black. Some individuals may have white areas ventrally on throat and abdominal region. Blubber layer is very thick, ¢.15-20 cm. Stout and stocky, girth of the North Atlantic Right Whale may be greater than 60% of total length. Proportionately large head can be roughly one-third of body length. Blowhole openings, positioned posteriorly on head, are widely separated from one another and angle slightly to the sides, causing spout to form a V-shaped spray 5 m high. Rostrum is narrow, elongate, and markedly arched. There are ¢.200-270 (average 250) thin baleen plates, each ¢.300 cm long. Baleen is gray-brown to black or and is fringed with long, fine, gray bristles. Lower lips form a pronounced arc, closing over baleen on each side of rostrum. Eyes are located just above apex of mouth on either side. Callosities are present on head in patterns that vary among individuals but in generally consistent locations, including behind blowhole, along rostrum, above eyes, on chin, and along mandibles. Hair sometimes grows in areas with callosities. Amphipod crustaceans, “whale lice,” belonging to the family Cyamidae commonly inhabit the callosities and feed on whale skin. Callosities are naturally gray or black but develop a white, yellow, or orange tint depending on the species of whale lice ( Cyamus ovalis , C. gracilis, or C. erraticus) inhabiting them. Male North Atlantic Right Whales generally have proportionally greater areas covered by callosities than females. There is no dorsal fin or ridge on the wide, smooth back. Flippers are relatively large, broad, and paddle-shaped, with angular leading edges. There is a deep notch between wide (up to ¢.30% oftotal body length), gently curving flukes. Habitat. Temperate waters of coastal regions, including shallow basins, areas over the continental shelf, and deeper areas over the continental slope. Availability of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus is considered an important factor in habitat suitability of North Atlantic Right Whales. Interestingly, although C. finmarchicus is dormant throughout the Gulf of Maine during winter, North Atlantic Right Whales apparently continue to prey on them at great depths in smaller regional basins. Young copepods develop during onset of the seasonal thermocline and the spring phytoplankton bloom into late-stage copepodites and adults by late spring. Data on prey species and oceanographic parameters have been used to model habitat suitability for North Atlantic Right Whales on a weekly timescale in Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel of the North Atlantic Ocean, and they demonstrated that habitat use patterns change seasonally. Inclusion of prey as a variable was an important factor in model accuracy; presence of C. finmarchicus was most influential to habitat suitability in winter and spring. Such habitat modeling allows prediction of whale presence on a real-time basis and may be important to conservation efforts. During the birthing season in winter, pregnant females are often observed in relatively sheltered, shallow coastal regions in their southern distribution. For pregnant females, presence of prey may be a less important factor in habitat selection than winter oceanographic conditions. As in other mysticete species, there is some evidence of maternal habitat fidelity in North Atlantic Right Whales and indication of learned habitat selection. Offspring learn suitable habitat in the company of their mothers, returning to those habitats in subsequent years. Food and Feeding. The North Atlantic Right Whale feeds mainly on calanoid copepods, most commonly C. finmarchicus. Documented prey items also include Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages spp., barnacle larvae, juvenile euphausiids, and a variety of nektonic plankton. The North Atlantic Right Whale is a skim feeder, swimming slowly with mouth open through densely concentrated swarms of prey, closing the mouth occasionally to flush out water. Feeding occurs at the water’s surface and, more frequently, deep below the surface. Feeding near the seafloor also apparently occurs occasionally. Generally, whales skimming with their mouths open at the surface, stop, closing their mouths, after having reached the end of a prey patch. Whales feeding at depth breath in c.10-15minute intervals, and thus their mouth-closing actions are more regular. Feeding dives commonly last c.10-20 minutes. Breeding. Some details of reproduction have been very well documented for the North Atlantic Right Whale, based on long-term studies using photo-identification of individuals. Long-term research over a period of several decades has shown fluctuation in its reproductive rate and birth intervals (time period between successive births for a single female). Birth intervals of North Atlantic Right Whales increased from an average of three years between births during the 1980s to more than five years by the late 1990s. Mean age of female maturity increased from approximately seven to nine years of age during the same period of study, and there was a significant decline in number of offspring produced per mature females during this time (mean percentage of offspring per mature female was 0-25%). In 2000-2005, however, birth rate increased; in previous decades, annual production of offspring for the population averaged twelve individuals annually, but then increased to 31, 29, 19, 16, and 28 offspring/year from 2001 to 2005, respectively. Right whales, in general, are thought to reach sexual maturity at body lengths of 1300-1400 cm. Courtship behavior is observed throughout the year on both birthing and feeding grounds, but fertile breeding is thought to be seasonal, with most births occurring from late December to March, with a peak in early January. Gestation is thought to be ¢.12-13 months, as has been determined for the Southern Right Whale (FE. australis ). A single young is born. Neonates are 400-550 cm long and weigh ¢.800 kg. Observations of live births of North Atlantic Right Whales at sea are extremely rare. Two live births were opportunistically observed and documented during aerial survey work in recent years. Fetal folds may be observed in newborns. Pale gray areas on head and rostrum of newborns where callosities will develop may be apparent but are smooth; they will become thickened during the first few months after birth, perhaps due, at least in part, to habitation by whale lice. Cyamids have not been observed in the callosities of newborns. Duration of lactation is 8-17 months, and it is thought that most young are weaned within their first year. Growth is rapid, with offspring reaching at least ¢.900 cm at weaning. Post-weaning growth may slow markedly until the young whale is of sufficient size and feeding ability to forage efficiently. Maximum age for North Atlantic Right Whales is not known, in part because of the difficulty of developing reliable age-determination methodologies for baleen whales, but photoidentification has placed one individual at a minimum of 70 years of age. Activity patterns. Right whales, in general, are commonly slow moving and occasionally rest at the surface for long periods. Nevertheless, the North Atlantic Right Whale is frequently observed engaged in active surface behavior, including breaching, lobtailing, flipper slapping, and raising flukes proceeding deep dives. It also has been observed to be very tactile, touching and rubbing conspecifics. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In the spring, North Atlantic Right Whales, predominately females with newborns and subadults (non-breeding females and most males may remain in northern areas throughout the year), move northward along the east coast of North America from late-winter birthing grounds off Florida and Georgia to late-spring and autumn, near-shore feeding grounds with cooler ocean temperatures and higher biological productivity. These feeding areas include certain basin areas within the Gulf of Maine, Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts Bay, Great South Channel, lower Bay of Fundy, and as far north as Nova Scotia. By summer and autumn, North Atlantic Right Whales are generally observed in the Bay of Fundy between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and at sites on the continental shelf of Nova Scotia. There may also be feeding grounds farther offshore and to the north. Regional movements between summer feeding grounds may be common and can be far-ranging. Longitudinal photo-identification studies of North Atlantic Right Whales in combination with satellite telemetry data collected from individuals equipped with radio tags in the Bay of Fundy over the last several decades have augmented visual survey data to reveal long-distance excursions. Individual movements from feeding grounds have proven to be highly variable. Some individuals moved extensively around the Gulf of Maine, Nova Scotia Shelf, northern Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the continental slope. Some radio-tagged individuals made trips exceeding 2000 km before returning to feeding grounds in the Bay of Fundy. Pregnant female North Atlantic Right Whales and many subadults leave feeding grounds in late autumn and move southward to warmer birthing grounds. Thus, there is apparent regional segregation during winter, with only part of the population present on birthing grounds. Adult females that are not giving birth have generally not been observed on birthing grounds, and adult males are generally absent. Location of these mature whales is uncertain, and it is also uncertain if this non-birthing segment of the population is aggregated elsewhere or scattered in areas of the North Atlantic Ocean. Results of recent demographic modeling, based on past survey work and comparisons of known individuals from photo-identification catalogues, suggest that significantly higher proportions of both known fathers and known conceptive females were present in whale aggregations in the Gulf of Maine during the winter breeding season compared with most other areas seasonally inhabited by right whales during this period. The work is not conclusive, but it may suggest that regions of the Gulf of Maine (and potentially other northern areas) are a mating ground for North Atlantic Right Whales. Although large aggregations may be observed on birthing and feeding grounds, North Atlantic Right Whales are commonly found alone, in pairs, or in small groups. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The North Atlantic Right Whale was found historically on both sides of the Atlantic, and it was considered to have consisted of two populations. The eastern North Atlantic population, which is now functionally extinct,is thought to have ranged from Cintra Bay (c.23° N), a once important winter birthing ground along the coast ofthe Western Sahara to the Bay of Biscay and northward to North Cape, Norway. Population designation for individuals occasionally observed during recent years in Iceland and Norway is undetermined. In the western North Atlantic, the population of the North Atlantic Right Whale was estimated at 490 individuals in 2010. The last assessment of this population for The IUCN Red List classified it as Endangered in 2008 when the population was believed to number only 300-350 individuals along the east coast of North America. Although a roughly 1-6% increase in reproductive rate has been observed in recent years (documented in 2001 and 2005), the increase is not enough to compensate for the estimated 2% annual decline in population size that had occurred over previous decades. No original pre-whaling population estimate is available for North Atlantic Right Whales off North America, but the low estimate for the number killed between 1634 and 1951 is 5500 individuals, and it is possible that twice that number were killed. Major threats to the North Atlantic Right Whale along the east coast of North America today, are ship strikes and bycatch in different types of fishing gear. Between 1970 and 2009, 38 North Atlantic Right Whales were recorded to have been killed in vessel collisions, and 31 were killed from fishery entanglements. These numbers are not sustainable given the small population size of the North Atlantic Right Whale. Examination of photographs of 626 individuals, taken between 1980 and 2009, indicated that c.83% had scars from being entangled in fishing gear at least one time and 59% had marks from having been entangled more than once. Subadults were entangled at a higher rate than adults. Low-frequency noise produced by ships masks naturally occurring sounds and causes habitat displacement, behavioral changes, ad-Justments in vocalizations, and increased levels of physiological stress. Vessel and sonic activity associated with oil and gas exploration are also known to expose large whales to detrimental noise levels. Other threats including low genetic variability, poor nutrition, chemical contaminants, biotoxins, and disease appear to be minor compared with ship strikes and entanglements. On following pages: 2.

Except on their N summer grounds, only a few sightings in the E Pacific Ocean during the past 50 years.","Total length can exceed 1700 cm; weight exceeding ¢.80,000 kg. The North Pacific Right Whale is sexually dimorphic, with females growing slightly larger than males. It can grow somewhat larger but is similar to the North Atlantic Right Whale ( E. glacialis ) in external morphology and color. The North Pacific Right Whale is mostly black. Often,it has a small white area ventrally at the navel. In some individuals, this white coloration may form a much larger patch and may even extend laterally onto sides of the body. Some individuals are completely black. As with the North Atlantic Right Whale, the North Pacific Right Whale is stout and stocky. Maximum girth is approximately 75% of total body length, with its large head one-third of body length. Blowhole openings are widely separated and angle slightly to the sides. Spout is V-shaped and can reach up to 5 m. Rostrum is narrow, elongate, and arched. Approximately 200-270 thin baleen plates, each ¢.300 cm long, hang from each side of upperjaw. Baleen is gray-brown to black and is fringed with long, fine, grayish bristles. Eyes are located above apex of mouth. Patterns of callosities vary among individuals, but they are distributed in generally consistent locations, including behind blowhole, along rostrum, above eyes, along mandibles, and on chin. Hair may grow from areas with callosities. Callosities are naturally gray or black in color and are inhabited by cyamids. There is no dorsal fin or ridge on the wide, smooth back. Flippers are relatively large, broad, and paddle-shaped, with angular leading edges. There is a deep notch between wide, gently curving flukes.","There is scant current information on habitat use of the North Pacific Right Whale. Historical records are indicative of pelagic feeding grounds in the Sea of Okhotsk, central and south-eastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska. In recent decades, consistent summer sightings of North Pacific Right Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka coast substantiate these areas as important feeding grounds. Based upon repeated sightings west of Bristol Bay in the south-eastern Bering Sea, this region is important summer habitat. In this area, North Pacific Right Whales appear to select relatively shallow waters in the mid-continental shelf. Not surprisingly, distribution of North Pacific Right Whales has been noted to coincide with areas abundant in their primary prey, calanoid copepods. North Pacific Right Whales also appear to have an extensive pelagic distribution, and this is likely related to availability of adultstage copepods in these regions of the Pacific Ocean. Birthing grounds are not known. Areas that have been suggested as potential winter birthing grounds for the western North Pacific population, based on sightings and other information, include the Ryukyu Islands, Yellow Sea, Taiwan Strait, and Bonin Islands (= Ogasawara Islands). There is no information regarding the current wintering grounds of the eastern North Pacific population, except a sighting off southern Baja California, Mexico. In the central North Pacific, the southernmost recent sighting was off Maui, Hawaii. The possibility that the North Pacific Right Whale winters in distant, offshore regions has been raised.","North Pacific Right Whales are skim feeders. They appear to feed selectively on preferred prey species, as has been observed for the other balaenid species. Aggregations of North Pacific Right Whales feeding on copepods of the genus Neocalanus have been observed in the North Pacific Ocean, and these, along with copepods of the genus Calanus, are the main prey items reported for western North Pacific Right Whales. Stomachs of North Pacific Right Whales killed by Japanese and Soviet whaling vessels in the 1950s contained calanoid copepods (Neocalanus, Calanus, and Metnidia). Quantities of the amphipod crustacean Parathemisto japonica and the krill species Euphausia pacifica also were found in stomach contents. Scientists onboard the whaling vessels also conducted pelagic zooplankton sampling in areas of the southeastern Bering Sea occupied by whales and noted that Calanus finmarchicus (now recognized as C. marshallae) was abundant; the copepod was postulated to be important to North Pacific Right Whales in that region. More recently, North Pacific Right Whales have been observed feeding in shallow waters over the middle Bering Sea shelf where C. marshallae was the primary species in plankton samples.","There is very little information on reproduction of the North Pacific Right Whale. Adult females can be mature as small as 1250 cm long. Based on data from fetuses of two pregnant females killed by Soviet whaling vessels, S. K. Klumov in 1962 gave a very preliminary estimate that mating may occur in November-December. He calculated gestation of the North Pacific Right Whale at c¢.11-12 months, butthis estimate is too short given gestation of other cetaceans and based on gestation of Southern Right Whales ( E. australis ) estimated at 12-13 months.","Similarly to their congeners, North Pacific Right Whales are slow moving. They were noted to remain calm and generally show no attempt at avoidance when approached by whaling vessels. Although North Pacific Right Whales were reported by soviet scientists to make shore dives of 4-6 minutes with maximum dive times of nine minutes,it is likely that most feeding dives for this species average 10-20 minutes like those of their congeners, the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Southern Righ Whale.","The North Pacific Right Whale appears to make northward migrations to high latitudes in spring and southward to lower latitudes in autumn. They may occupy both offshore and inshore areas in the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska as their primary summer feeding grounds. There have been repeated sightings in the south-eastern Bering Sea west of Bristol Bay and off the south side of Kodiak Island. Wintering grounds of North Pacific Right Whales are not well known, and only scattered records ofsingle individuals exist.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red Last, with the north-eastern North Pacific subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. The original distribution of the North Pacific Right Whale was never documented in any detail before it was depleted by the middle of the 19"" century. Today, whales are found in winter around the Bonin Islands, Ryukyu Islands, and Yellow Sea (west of the Korean Peninsula); in summer (feeding grounds), they are found from the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands, north to off the Kamchatka Peninsula, Commander Islands, and the western Bering Sea. In the East Pacific Ocean, North Pacific Right Whales moved north off the California coast and along the western coast of North America, but since the 1990s, they have only been seen regularly from summer to early autumn in the south-eastern Bering Sea, west of Bristol Bay, Alaska (¢.57°-59° N), and sometimes in the Gulf of Alaska. Western and eastern populations of the North Pacific Right Whale have different geographic distributions, population sizes, and stranding histories. In the western North Pacific Ocean, they are poorly known, and the only available population estimate is outdated and only preliminary based on data collected during dedicated line-transect surveys for Common Minke Whales ( Balaenoptera acutorostrata), conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk during 1989, 1990, and 1992. The resulting population estimate of 922 North Pacific Right Whales was based on only a limited number of sightings and the confidence interval was wide (404-2108 individuals). However, the most recent [UCN assessment gives 400 for the Sea of Okhotsk population size. Sighting data are available from additional Russian and Japanese surveys conducted since 1992, but they have not yet been analyzed. No assessment has been made for the north-western subpopulation of the North Pacific Right Whale because of the outdated population estimate. No estimate is available for the pre-whaling size of this subpopulation, but large numbers of right whales were taken in the North Pacific during the 19"" century, and illegal Soviet pelagic catches made during the 1960s included at least 152 whales taken from the Sea of Okhotsk. Major current threats are bycatch in various types of fishing gear. No deaths of North Pacific Right Whales from ship strikes have been reported, butthis is likely an important threat because of their coastal nature in much of their distribution, especially in coastal waters of China, Korea, and Japan. In the Sea of Okhotsk, future oil and gas activities will pose risks to North Pacific Right Whales on their summer feeding grounds. The current abundance estimate for the north-eastern North Pacific population is only ¢.30 individuals, based on independent photo-identifications and genetic mark-recaptures. No pre-whaling estimate is available for this population. They were depleted quickly in the middle of the 19"" century. Some were also killed during the start of modern commercial whaling off Alaska and British Columbia, Canada,in the early part of the 20"" century and then after c.30 years of no catches,illegal Soviet pelagic whaling operations killed a minimum of 529 individuals in the Gulf of Alaska and south-eastern Bering Sea in the 1960s. Bycatch in various types of fishing gear and ship strikes are the two most important current threats, but to date, there have not been any confirmed deaths. Potential future threats include oil and gas activities on summer feeding grounds of the North Pacific Right Whale.","Brownell et al. (2001) | Clapham, Good et al.

Historical records are indicative of pelagic feeding grounds in the Sea of Okhotsk, central and south-eastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska. In recent decades, consistent summer sightings of North Pacific Right Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka coast substantiate these areas as important feeding grounds. Based upon repeated sightings west of Bristol Bay in the south-eastern Bering Sea, this region is important summer habitat. In this area, North Pacific Right Whales appear to select relatively shallow waters in the mid-continental shelf. Not surprisingly, distribution of North Pacific Right Whales has been noted to coincide with areas abundant in their primary prey, calanoid copepods. North Pacific Right Whales also appear to have an extensive pelagic distribution, and this is likely related to availability of adultstage copepods in these regions of the Pacific Ocean. Birthing grounds are not known. Areas that have been suggested as potential winter birthing grounds for the western North Pacific population, based on sightings and other information, include the Ryukyu Islands, Yellow Sea, Taiwan Strait, and Bonin Islands (= Ogasawara Islands). There is no information regarding the current wintering grounds of the eastern North Pacific population, except a sighting off southern Baja California, Mexico. In the central North Pacific, the southernmost recent sighting was off Maui, Hawaii. The possibility that the North Pacific Right Whale winters in distant, offshore regions has been raised. Food and Feeding. North Pacific Right Whales are skim feeders. They appear to feed selectively on preferred prey species, as has been observed for the other balaenid species. Aggregations of North Pacific Right Whales feeding on copepods of the genus Neocalanus have been observed in the North Pacific Ocean, and these, along with copepods of the genus Calanus, are the main prey items reported for western North Pacific Right Whales. Stomachs of North Pacific Right Whales killed by Japanese and Soviet whaling vessels in the 1950s contained calanoid copepods (Neocalanus, Calanus, and Metnidia). Quantities of the amphipod crustacean Parathemisto japonica and the krill species Euphausia pacifica also were found in stomach contents. Scientists onboard the whaling vessels also conducted pelagic zooplankton sampling in areas of the southeastern Bering Sea occupied by whales and noted that Calanus finmarchicus (now recognized as C. marshallae) was abundant; the copepod was postulated to be important to North Pacific Right Whales in that region. More recently, North Pacific Right Whales have been observed feeding in shallow waters over the middle Bering Sea shelf where C. marshallae was the primary species in plankton samples. Breeding. There is very little information on reproduction of the North Pacific Right Whale. Adult females can be mature as small as 1250 cm long. Based on data from fetuses of two pregnant females killed by Soviet whaling vessels, S. K. Klumov in 1962 gave a very preliminary estimate that mating may occur in November-December. He calculated gestation of the North Pacific Right Whale at c¢.11-12 months, butthis estimate is too short given gestation of other cetaceans and based on gestation of Southern Right Whales ( E. australis ) estimated at 12-13 months. Activity patterns. Similarly to their congeners, North Pacific Right Whales are slow moving. They were noted to remain calm and generally show no attempt at avoidance when approached by whaling vessels. Although North Pacific Right Whales were reported by soviet scientists to make shore dives of 4-6 minutes with maximum dive times of nine minutes,it is likely that most feeding dives for this species average 10-20 minutes like those of their congeners, the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Southern Righ Whale. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The North Pacific Right Whale appears to make northward migrations to high latitudes in spring and southward to lower latitudes in autumn. They may occupy both offshore and inshore areas in the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska as their primary summer feeding grounds. There have been repeated sightings in the south-eastern Bering Sea west of Bristol Bay and off the south side of Kodiak Island. Wintering grounds of North Pacific Right Whales are not well known, and only scattered records ofsingle individuals exist. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red Last, with the north-eastern North Pacific subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. The original distribution of the North Pacific Right Whale was never documented in any detail before it was depleted by the middle of the 19"" century. Today, whales are found in winter around the Bonin Islands, Ryukyu Islands, and Yellow Sea (west of the Korean Peninsula); in summer (feeding grounds), they are found from the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands, north to off the Kamchatka Peninsula, Commander Islands, and the western Bering Sea. In the East Pacific Ocean, North Pacific Right Whales moved north off the California coast and along the western coast of North America, but since the 1990s, they have only been seen regularly from summer to early autumn in the south-eastern Bering Sea, west of Bristol Bay, Alaska (¢.57°-59° N), and sometimes in the Gulf of Alaska. Western and eastern populations of the North Pacific Right Whale have different geographic distributions, population sizes, and stranding histories. In the western North Pacific Ocean, they are poorly known, and the only available population estimate is outdated and only preliminary based on data collected during dedicated line-transect surveys for Common Minke Whales ( Balaenoptera acutorostrata), conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk during 1989, 1990, and 1992. The resulting population estimate of 922 North Pacific Right Whales was based on only a limited number of sightings and the confidence interval was wide (404-2108 individuals). However, the most recent [UCN assessment gives 400 for the Sea of Okhotsk population size. Sighting data are available from additional Russian and Japanese surveys conducted since 1992, but they have not yet been analyzed. No assessment has been made for the north-western subpopulation of the North Pacific Right Whale because of the outdated population estimate. No estimate is available for the pre-whaling size of this subpopulation, but large numbers of right whales were taken in the North Pacific during the 19"" century, and illegal Soviet pelagic catches made during the 1960s included at least 152 whales taken from the Sea of Okhotsk. Major current threats are bycatch in various types of fishing gear. No deaths of North Pacific Right Whales from ship strikes have been reported, butthis is likely an important threat because of their coastal nature in much of their distribution, especially in coastal waters of China, Korea, and Japan. In the Sea of Okhotsk, future oil and gas activities will pose risks to North Pacific Right Whales on their summer feeding grounds. The current abundance estimate for the north-eastern North Pacific population is only ¢.30 individuals, based on independent photo-identifications and genetic mark-recaptures. No pre-whaling estimate is available for this population. They were depleted quickly in the middle of the 19"" century. Some were also killed during the start of modern commercial whaling off Alaska and British Columbia, Canada,in the early part of the 20"" century and then after c.30 years of no catches,illegal Soviet pelagic whaling operations killed a minimum of 529 individuals in the Gulf of Alaska and south-eastern Bering Sea in the 1960s. Bycatch in various types of fishing gear and ship strikes are the two most important current threats, but to date, there have not been any confirmed deaths. Potential future threats include oil and gas activities on summer feeding grounds of the North Pacific Right Whale. Bibliography. Brownell et al. (2001), Clapham, Good et al.

Concentrated in winter near the coastlines off S Australia, New Zealand, Atlantic coast of South America (Argentina, Brazil), and S Africa (mainly South Africa), but also off Chile, Peru, Tristan da Cunha Is and the E coast of Madagascar; in summer they are found mainly in latitudes of 40-50° S but have been seen in the Antarctic as far as 65° S and around South Georgia Is.","Total length 1500-1650 cm; weight to ¢.60,000 kg. Like other species of Fubalaena, the Southern Right Whale is massive and stocky, with an extremely large head. Although Southern Right Whales are generally black, they have white patches ventrally on tip of lowerjaws and abdominal region. These areas may be more extensive on Southern Right Whales than on their congeners. Pale grayish area may be visible on backs of a few individuals. Southern Right Whales can have a whitened or pale gray mottled appearance caused by sloughing of skin. Variations in the overall black color have been observed, with some individuals having a bluish or brown coloration. There is no dorsal fin or ridge on the wide, smooth back. Flipper length is up to 170 cm. Flukes are wide and taper gently to smooth trailing edges. There are on average 222 baleen plates that range from gray to black, with a maximum length of 240 cm, and have fine fringes. Callosities on Southern Right Whales are prevalent and broadly dispersed on head and rostral region; they frequently occur along top of lower jaw. Males have more callosities than females. It has been suggested that callosities are used aggressively in male-male competition for females. Differences in patterns of callosities are used to identify individuals in photo-identification research of Southern Right Whales. In addition to cyamids that inhabit callosities of all species of right whale, barnacles (Tubinicella major) occur in callosities of Southern Right Whales.","Feeding grounds of Southern Right Whales are not well known. In the southern Atlantic Ocean, they may be mainly offshore, and in Antarctic waters, they are also apparently predominately offshore. As with other species of right whales, feeding grounds of Southern Right Whales are likely to be areas of extremely high productivity and prey abundance. Most of the relatively few offshore sightings indicate individuals may occupy areas within the subtropical and Antarctic convergences. Sheltered, shallow waters and bays in many coastal areas are used to give birth. These birthing grounds include areas off Argentina, Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Australia, New Zealand, Auckland Islands, and Chile.","Southern Right Whales are skim feeders, using their long, finely bristled baleen to filter prey from the water at the surface and below. Both copepods and krill are important in their diets. Euphausiids, including euphausiid krill (Euphausia superba) and squat lobster (Munida spp.), form a larger part of diets of Southern Right Whales than those of North Atlantic Right Whales ( E. glacialis ) and North Pacific Right Whales ( E. japonica ). When feeding north of the subtropical convergence, Southern Right Whales are likely to feed mainly on copepods, but they also feed on euphausiid krill within the Antarctic Convergence where krill predominates. Interestingly, whaling data reflected this pattern: 91-7% of whales north of 40° S had fed on copepods (mainly Calanus propinquus and Pleuromamma robusta), whereas more than 99% of whales south of 50° S had euphausiids in their stomachs.","Average age offirst birth for female Southern Right Whales is at 9-12 years, when females are more than 1200 cm in length. Gestation is 12-13 months. Birth interval is typically about three years but may be as long as five years when prey availability is limited. Births occur in June—-October, with a peak in late August. Neonatal length is 450-600 cm. Weaning is at a minimum of 7-8 months but can be extended to 12-14 months. Breeding is thought to mainly occur from June to September, but like North Atlantic Right Whales, mating of Southern Right Whales has been observed throughout the year. Southern Right Whales are known to aggregate in large surface-active groups where males appear to compete for a single female—as is also similar to North Atlantic Right Whales. Mating has been observed on and around birthing grounds, but some segregation is likely between breeding adults and female—offspring pairs.","Like their congeners, Southern Right Whales are slow moving, often resting or logging at the surface. They are also often observed breaching and engaging in other active behaviors at the water’s surface, including flipper slapping and lobtailing. Southern Right Whales in Argentina and South Africa use their flukes as sails at the water’s surface, letting the wind glide them through the water for short distances. Tactile behavior—touching and rubbing conspecifics—has also been observed in Southern Right Whales.","Southern Right Whales migrate northward to coastal areas for the austral winter. In summer, they move southward, presumably to more offshore areas. Recent satellite-tagging research was conducted in September-December 2001 at Saint Sebastian Bay and Saldanha Bay, South Africa. Results from tagging were combined with information based on photo-identification, aerial surveys, and historical catch records to provide insight into movements of Southern Right Whales in that region. Fifteen individuals were tracked for 25-161 days. Nine whales remained along the coastline (four females with offspring, three unaccompanied females, one male, and one of undetermined sex), and movements (although not always unidirectional) were primarily westward. Movements of female—offspring pairs were generally slower that those of other classes. Four of the nine whales remaining in coastal areas moved to Saint Helena Bay, which was likely a feeding ground, and stayed there for 36-100 days. Six individuals moved offshore; one could not be tracked subsequent to its departure, and five (three males, one female, one of undetermined sex) moved, independently, heading south-west into the South Atlantic Ocean, covering distances of 3800-8200 km. These five individuals were considered to be migrating. Speeds for these individuals were 0-6-2-8 km/h. Two areas were possible feeding grounds because of the non-directionality of movements while the whales traversed the areas. Each of the five whales moved into the South Atlantic Ocean where their transmitters eventually stopped. There have been limited sightings of Southern Right Whales in Antarctic waters during summer. Away from aggregation sites, Southern Right Whales are often found alone or in small numbers.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, with the Peru—Chile subpopulation of the Southern Right Whale classified as Critically Endangered. Moving clockwise from the western South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Right Whales are found from May through December in coastal waters off Brazil, from ¢.8-32° S (mainly 27-29° S) to Uruguay and south to central Argentina (mainly around Valdes Peninsula) and south to Cabo Virgenes (52° 19° S) and into the Straits of Magellan and the Beagle Channel. In the mid-South Atlantic Ocean, they are found around Tristan da Cunha (c.38° S, 12° E). In the eastern South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Right Whales are found in the north off the Namibian/Angolan coast (c.16—-27° S), with the majority found between 18° 30” S and 21° 30’ S, and then south to South Africa between Saint Helena Bay in the west and Port Elizabeth to the east. In the south-western Indian Ocean, they are in waters off Mozambique and Madagascar. Off western Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean, Southern Right Whales occurin the north at least as far as Exmouth (c.22° S, 114° E), but most are found between Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia (32° 33° S, 115° 08 E) and Ceduna, South Australia (32° 08’ S, 133° 41"" E). In the south-western Pacific Ocean, they were known from the coastal waters around New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands (29° S, 178° W), where they are now absent. There are some recent records of Southern Right Whales reestablishing former wintering grounds off mainland New Zealand. Southern Right Whales are found near the Auckland Islands during austral winter and in North-west Bay, Campbell Island, in February-September. In the eastern South Pacific Ocean, the few remaining Southern Right Whales are known from Bahia San Fernando, Peru (15° 08S) in the north, southward to at least Isla Grande de Chiloe, Chile (42° S), but they are more commonly observed around Isla Grande de Chile, Chile. The bestknown feeding areas of the Southern Right Whales are around the Falkland Islands and South Georgia (February—May), the Antarctic Peninsula, and below 40° S off Australia. In the Indian Ocean, they are known from the Crozet Islands (c.46° S, 51° E) and Kerguelen Islands. In 1997, the total population of the Southern Right Whale was ¢.7600 individuals in the three ocean basins of the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Right Whale has long been widely recognized as having had been over-utilized and depleted by commercial hunting during the late 18"" 19""and early 20"" centuries— hunting that only ended in the 1930s. During the 200 years between the start of commercial whaling for the Southern Right Whale in the 1770s and complete cessation in the early 1970s, total catch was ¢.115,000 individuals. Combined catches within each of the three ocean basins were ¢.63,000 individuals in the South Atlantic, 38,000 in the South Pacific, and 13,000 in the Indian Ocean. This included more than 3300 Southern Right Whales taken illegally during Soviet pelagic whaling operations, mainly in the 1960s. Based on a model used at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 1998 Right Whale Workshop, the initial abundance of Southern Right Whales in 1770 was estimated at ¢.55,000-70,000 individuals. After human exploitation ceased, most populations of Southern Right Whales began to increase. Total population size was estimated at ¢.7600 individuals in 1997, and the population model used to make this estimate suggested a current annual growth rate of 7-5%, although this rate of increase may have slowed in recent years. No current population assessmentis available. The Brazil-Argentina population of the Southern Right Whale in Argentine waters was estimated at 2577 individuals in 1997. In waters off Argentina, the population had been increasing 6-8-7-6% /year since the early 1970s, butthis rate is now slowing to ¢.6%/ year. Since 2003 when the Southern Right Whale Monitoring Program was established in the region of Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, 366 whale deaths have been recorded; number of dead individuals per year was 31 in 2003, 47 in 2005, 83 in 2007, 95 in 2008, and 79 in 2009, with more than 90% of the deaths being young born in those years. Causes of these annual die-offs remain unknown, but a workshop in 2010 agreed on three likely hypotheses (or some combination of them): (1) reduced food availability for adult females, (2) acute or chronic toxicity resulting from exposure to biotoxins, and (3) infectious disease. As of October 2012, another large die-off was underway. In breeding areas around Valdes Peninsula, kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) feed by pecking on skin and blubber on backs of Southern Right Whales. This gull harassment has increased since it was first documented in 1972, and extensive wounding is now sometimes observed on backs of Southern Right Whales, frequently on female—offspring pairs. It has been suggested that gull attacks could negatively affect the population of Southern Right Whales via disruption to female—offspring pairs and potential transmission of pathogens and infectious diseases. A subsequent workshop, convened in 2013, concluded that the increasing frequency of gull attacks, including concomitant increases in physical and behavioral disturbance to Southern Right Whales, has reached a threshold level in recent years above which these factors may induce death in some Southern Right Whale offspring, leading to the high levels of mortality recorded since 2005. In South African waters, the population of the Southern Right Whale was estimated at 3104 individuals in 1997. In 2008, the population estimate had only increased to 3612 individuals. There has not been any die-off in this area, but entanglementin fishing gearis ¢.3:5% /year. The Australian population of the Southern Right Whale was estimated at 1197 individuals in 1997. In 2009, the best estimate in Australia between Cape Leeuwin and Ceduna was 2900 individuals. Based on photoidentification, genetic samples, and mark-recapture methods comparing winter surveys between 1995-1997 and 2006-2009, number of Southern Right Whales off the Auckland Islands was estimated at a minimum of 2306 individuals. The Peru—Chile subpopulation of the Southern Right Whale likely has fewer than 50 individuals remaining. No pre-whaling population estimate is available, but it is known that French vessels alone killed an estimated 2372 Southern Right Whales in Chilean waters in 1817-1837. Mortalities of South Right Whales due to entanglements in fishing gear and collisions with ships are known throughout the Southern Hemisphere, and human activities in Chile caused at least two whale deaths: one was a young individual harpooned by fishermen and the other was a young that stranded after being struck by a vessel. Any human-caused mortality, especially females, in this subpopulation is a serious issue. Vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement of Southern Right Whales are rare compared with the number of cases known for North Atlantic Right Whales. In Australia, there are at least four cases of entanglementin fishing gear in 1991-1997. In other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, known fishing-gear entanglements include the following: at least 14 entanglements in South Africa in 1963-1997; two in the Auckland Islands in 1995-1997; seven in Argentina in 1969-1997; approximately four per year in Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 1989-1997; three along the San Paulo coast, Brazil, in 1982-1996; and three off Rio de Janeiro in 1981-1992. Southern Right Whales killed or injured by vessel collisions are known from South Africa and Brazil. Thirteen collisions, ten of which were fatal, occurred off South Africa in 1983-1997, and four collisions, at least three fatal, occurred off Brazil in 1989-1993. Collisions with large vessels are of concern for Southern Right Whales around Australia, particularly on shipping routes on the eastern seaboard near the Bass Strait. Numbers of vessel strikes and gear entanglements are too small in relation to current population sizes to impede continued population growth and recovery of populations of Southern Right Whales, except for the Peru—Chile subpopulation. Disturbance and displacement caused by ship noise are threats to Southern Right Whales, perhaps especially in feeding and birthing grounds, and they could potentially disrupt important social activities including breeding. Harassment from whale watching and boaters also potentially present a threat. Prey depletion caused by overfishing of krill and habitat degradation may impact populations of Southern Right Whales. Potential effects of climate change on krill (E. superba) abundance, and thus ability of Southern Right Whales to feed on this prey, could impact their continued recovery.","Aguayo et al.

They are also often observed breaching and engaging in other active behaviors at the water’s surface, including flipper slapping and lobtailing. Southern Right Whales in Argentina and South Africa use their flukes as sails at the water’s surface, letting the wind glide them through the water for short distances. Tactile behavior—touching and rubbing conspecifics—has also been observed in Southern Right Whales. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Southern Right Whales migrate northward to coastal areas for the austral winter. In summer, they move southward, presumably to more offshore areas. Recent satellite-tagging research was conducted in September-December 2001 at Saint Sebastian Bay and Saldanha Bay, South Africa. Results from tagging were combined with information based on photo-identification, aerial surveys, and historical catch records to provide insight into movements of Southern Right Whales in that region. Fifteen individuals were tracked for 25-161 days. Nine whales remained along the coastline (four females with offspring, three unaccompanied females, one male, and one of undetermined sex), and movements (although not always unidirectional) were primarily westward. Movements of female—offspring pairs were generally slower that those of other classes. Four of the nine whales remaining in coastal areas moved to Saint Helena Bay, which was likely a feeding ground, and stayed there for 36-100 days. Six individuals moved offshore; one could not be tracked subsequent to its departure, and five (three males, one female, one of undetermined sex) moved, independently, heading south-west into the South Atlantic Ocean, covering distances of 3800-8200 km. These five individuals were considered to be migrating. Speeds for these individuals were 0-6-2-8 km/h. Two areas were possible feeding grounds because of the non-directionality of movements while the whales traversed the areas. Each of the five whales moved into the South Atlantic Ocean where their transmitters eventually stopped. There have been limited sightings of Southern Right Whales in Antarctic waters during summer. Away from aggregation sites, Southern Right Whales are often found alone or in small numbers. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, with the Peru—Chile subpopulation of the Southern Right Whale classified as Critically Endangered. Moving clockwise from the western South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Right Whales are found from May through December in coastal waters off Brazil, from ¢.8-32° S (mainly 27-29° S) to Uruguay and south to central Argentina (mainly around Valdes Peninsula) and south to Cabo Virgenes (52° 19° S) and into the Straits of Magellan and the Beagle Channel. In the mid-South Atlantic Ocean, they are found around Tristan da Cunha (c.38° S, 12° E). In the eastern South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Right Whales are found in the north off the Namibian/Angolan coast (c.16—-27° S), with the majority found between 18° 30” S and 21° 30’ S, and then south to South Africa between Saint Helena Bay in the west and Port Elizabeth to the east. In the south-western Indian Ocean, they are in waters off Mozambique and Madagascar. Off western Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean, Southern Right Whales occurin the north at least as far as Exmouth (c.22° S, 114° E), but most are found between Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia (32° 33° S, 115° 08 E) and Ceduna, South Australia (32° 08’ S, 133° 41"" E). In the south-western Pacific Ocean, they were known from the coastal waters around New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands (29° S, 178° W), where they are now absent. There are some recent records of Southern Right Whales reestablishing former wintering grounds off mainland New Zealand. Southern Right Whales are found near the Auckland Islands during austral winter and in North-west Bay, Campbell Island, in February-September. In the eastern South Pacific Ocean, the few remaining Southern Right Whales are known from Bahia San Fernando, Peru (15° 08S) in the north, southward to at least Isla Grande de Chiloe, Chile (42° S), but they are more commonly observed around Isla Grande de Chile, Chile. The bestknown feeding areas of the Southern Right Whales are around the Falkland Islands and South Georgia (February—May), the Antarctic Peninsula, and below 40° S off Australia. In the Indian Ocean, they are known from the Crozet Islands (c.46° S, 51° E) and Kerguelen Islands. In 1997, the total population of the Southern Right Whale was ¢.7600 individuals in the three ocean basins of the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Right Whale has long been widely recognized as having had been over-utilized and depleted by commercial hunting during the late 18"" 19""and early 20"" centuries— hunting that only ended in the 1930s. During the 200 years between the start of commercial whaling for the Southern Right Whale in the 1770s and complete cessation in the early 1970s, total catch was ¢.115,000 individuals. Combined catches within each of the three ocean basins were ¢.63,000 individuals in the South Atlantic, 38,000 in the South Pacific, and 13,000 in the Indian Ocean. This included more than 3300 Southern Right Whales taken illegally during Soviet pelagic whaling operations, mainly in the 1960s. Based on a model used at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 1998 Right Whale Workshop, the initial abundance of Southern Right Whales in 1770 was estimated at ¢.55,000-70,000 individuals. After human exploitation ceased, most populations of Southern Right Whales began to increase. Total population size was estimated at ¢.7600 individuals in 1997, and the population model used to make this estimate suggested a current annual growth rate of 7-5%, although this rate of increase may have slowed in recent years. No current population assessmentis available. The Brazil-Argentina population of the Southern Right Whale in Argentine waters was estimated at 2577 individuals in 1997. In waters off Argentina, the population had been increasing 6-8-7-6% /year since the early 1970s, butthis rate is now slowing to ¢.6%/ year. Since 2003 when the Southern Right Whale Monitoring Program was established in the region of Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, 366 whale deaths have been recorded; number of dead individuals per year was 31 in 2003, 47 in 2005, 83 in 2007, 95 in 2008, and 79 in 2009, with more than 90% of the deaths being young born in those years. Causes of these annual die-offs remain unknown, but a workshop in 2010 agreed on three likely hypotheses (or some combination of them): (1) reduced food availability for adult females, (2) acute or chronic toxicity resulting from exposure to biotoxins, and (3) infectious disease. As of October 2012, another large die-off was underway. In breeding areas around Valdes Peninsula, kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) feed by pecking on skin and blubber on backs of Southern Right Whales. This gull harassment has increased since it was first documented in 1972, and extensive wounding is now sometimes observed on backs of Southern Right Whales, frequently on female—offspring pairs. It has been suggested that gull attacks could negatively affect the population of Southern Right Whales via disruption to female—offspring pairs and potential transmission of pathogens and infectious diseases. A subsequent workshop, convened in 2013, concluded that the increasing frequency of gull attacks, including concomitant increases in physical and behavioral disturbance to Southern Right Whales, has reached a threshold level in recent years above which these factors may induce death in some Southern Right Whale offspring, leading to the high levels of mortality recorded since 2005. In South African waters, the population of the Southern Right Whale was estimated at 3104 individuals in 1997. In 2008, the population estimate had only increased to 3612 individuals. There has not been any die-off in this area, but entanglementin fishing gearis ¢.3:5% /year. The Australian population of the Southern Right Whale was estimated at 1197 individuals in 1997. In 2009, the best estimate in Australia between Cape Leeuwin and Ceduna was 2900 individuals. Based on photoidentification, genetic samples, and mark-recapture methods comparing winter surveys between 1995-1997 and 2006-2009, number of Southern Right Whales off the Auckland Islands was estimated at a minimum of 2306 individuals. The Peru—Chile subpopulation of the Southern Right Whale likely has fewer than 50 individuals remaining. No pre-whaling population estimate is available, but it is known that French vessels alone killed an estimated 2372 Southern Right Whales in Chilean waters in 1817-1837. Mortalities of South Right Whales due to entanglements in fishing gear and collisions with ships are known throughout the Southern Hemisphere, and human activities in Chile caused at least two whale deaths: one was a young individual harpooned by fishermen and the other was a young that stranded after being struck by a vessel. Any human-caused mortality, especially females, in this subpopulation is a serious issue. Vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement of Southern Right Whales are rare compared with the number of cases known for North Atlantic Right Whales. In Australia, there are at least four cases of entanglementin fishing gear in 1991-1997. In other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, known fishing-gear entanglements include the following: at least 14 entanglements in South Africa in 1963-1997; two in the Auckland Islands in 1995-1997; seven in Argentina in 1969-1997; approximately four per year in Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 1989-1997; three along the San Paulo coast, Brazil, in 1982-1996; and three off Rio de Janeiro in 1981-1992. Southern Right Whales killed or injured by vessel collisions are known from South Africa and Brazil. Thirteen collisions, ten of which were fatal, occurred off South Africa in 1983-1997, and four collisions, at least three fatal, occurred off Brazil in 1989-1993. Collisions with large vessels are of concern for Southern Right Whales around Australia, particularly on shipping routes on the eastern seaboard near the Bass Strait. Numbers of vessel strikes and gear entanglements are too small in relation to current population sizes to impede continued population growth and recovery of populations of Southern Right Whales, except for the Peru—Chile subpopulation. Disturbance and displacement caused by ship noise are threats to Southern Right Whales, perhaps especially in feeding and birthing grounds, and they could potentially disrupt important social activities including breeding. Harassment from whale watching and boaters also potentially present a threat. Prey depletion caused by overfishing of krill and habitat degradation may impact populations of Southern Right Whales. Potential effects of climate change on krill (E. superba) abundance, and thus ability of Southern Right Whales to feed on this prey, could impact their continued recovery. Bibliography. Aguayo et al.

Bowhead Whales are massive and frequently described as rotund. Like other mysticetes, Bowhead Whales are sexually dimorphic, with females slightly larger than males. Head is enormous and may compose more that one-third of the total body length. Bowhead Whales have a noticeable postcranial indentation posterior to blowhole at the neck area. Blowhole is pronounced, situated on a prominence composed of dense fibrous connective tissue and muscle. Blowhole openings are widely separated from one another and angle slightly to the sides. Spoutis a V-shaped spray that can be as much as 5 m high. Rostrum is extremely arched, and mouth is strongly bowed. There are 230-360 baleen plates suspended from each side of the upper jaw. Baleen is up to 500 cm in length, the longest of any baleen whale. Plates are dark gray or brown to black and are fringed with long, fine bristles. Eyes are located above gape of mouth. There is no dorsal fin on the broad, smooth back. Flippers are large, and flukes are wide, reaching up to 600 cm across. Bowhead Whales are adapted to ice pack habitat and have very thick blubber (maximum c.38—42 cm) and skin layers. Blubber acts as a thermal insulator in cold Arctic temperatures, and skin is thought to provide protection against ridged pack ice and rough seafloor. External markings from contact with ice and seafloor are noticeable on many individuals. Bowhead Whales are extremely long-lived. Old stone and ivory harpoon pieces have been recovered from blubber of Bowhead Whales, indicating a long life, and remarkably, bomb lance fragments that were manufactured in 1879-1885 were recovered in 1980 and 2007 from two dead Bowhead Whales. Obtaining accurate estimates of age for baleen whales has proven difficult. Promising methods tested for age determination in baleen whales include aspartic acid racemization (AAR) to read growth-layer groups in eye lenses and counting of ovarian corpora (scars left where a follicle has released an egg). Eye lenses of 42 Bowhead Whales landed by Alaskan Inuit were examined using AAR. The oldest female was estimated to be 88 years old, and the oldest male 145 years. A method combining total length and reproductive data has also proven useful for age estimates. Interestingly, a very old stone harpoon tip was recovered from one female aged with this method; her “corpora age” was 133 years old.","Closely associated with Arctic pack ice. It has been suggested that these icy regions serve as a refuge from Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Bowhead Whales select habitat in the Arctic that is characterized by high productivity and availability of zooplankton prey. In summer, they generally occupy continental slope waters with moderate ice conditions. In autumn, Bowhead Whales occupy inner shelf waters with relatively light ice conditions.","Stomach contents of Bowhead Whales have been well documented. Numerous prey species have been identified in their stomachs, but there is a clear preference for copepods (Calanus) and eupausiid krill. Mysid shrimps and gammarid amphipods are also sometimes prevalent in stomachs of Bowhead Whales. They skim the water’s surface to feed and also feed in the water column and at the seafloor. Bowhead Whales have been observed surface skimming synchronously, moving on their sides with mouths open, synchronously diving and surfacing while feeding, and cooperatively feeding, including in echelon formation. Typical feeding dives may last 5-15 minutes.","Breeding of the Bowhead Whale is thought to occurin late winter and early spring. Sexual activity has been observed throughout the year. Breeding is thoughtto involve sperm competition, and like right whales, mating groups are often composed of a single female with multiple males competing for access. Estimated gestation is 13— 14 months. Young are born in spring, with a peak in May. Young Bowhead Whales are 470-500 cm long at birth. Total length at one year of age is ¢.820 cm. Length at sexual maturity is estimated to be 1300-1350 cm for females and 1200-1300 cm for males.","Bowhead Whales are slow moving, and they are also observed breaching and fluke slapping at the surface. Flukes are lifted prior to deep dives. Data for eight Bowhead Whales equipped with satellite-monitored radio tags in the Beaufort and Chuckchi seas for approximately one month indicated that many dives were short, less than one minute in duration. Most dives were shallow to c¢.16 m. Five of the whales dove deeper than 100 m, with the deepest dive recorded at 352 m. Deeper dives, which occurred over the deep-water Mackenzie Canyon, were thought to be associated with feeding behavior. Bowhead Whales may be capable of dives with durations of up to approximately one hour. They can break through ice of ¢.60 cm thick and may sometimes make their way through ice floes in this manner.","Seasonal distribution and movements of Bowhead Whales are closely associated with changes in cover of sea ice. They migrate to high Arctic latitudes in summer and return to more marginal ice areas during maximum ice in winter, traveling seasonally between high-productivity areas of densely concentrated prey species. Data from satellite monitoring of nine radio-tagged whales off West Greenland indicated localized use of a single site for 3-6 weeks between long-distance, offshore movements that lasted 1-2 weeks. Travel velocity was up to 200 km/day, which was considered too rapid for foraging to be feasible during these long-distance movements. It has been suggested that Bowhead Whales meet their energetic needs during intense feeding periods; their large body size combined with blubber stores may accommodate the energy needed to survive variability in pelagic productivity and allow for long-distance travel between regions of greater prey availability. Bowhead Whales are generally observed individually or in groups of up to three. Larger groups are observed during migration, and like right whales, Bowhead Whales form large aggregations on feeding grounds. Segregation by sex has been documented in Bowhead Whales. For example, mature females without offspring are thought to occupy Disko Bay, whereas primarily female—offspring pairs are observed in Foxe Basin. Baffin Bay is commonly occupied by adult males and by resting or pregnant females from Disko Bay. Prince Regent, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and north-western Hudson Bay, Canada, are used by nursing females, their offspring, and subadults. It has been suggested that mature females (without young) use Disko Bay as a feeding ground during phases of the reproductive cycle. Interestingly, acoustic recordings of singing individuals may indicate that breeding occurs in Disko Bay, and males may be following estrous females into the area. Segregation by size class of Bowhead Whales has been observed in the Central Beaufort Sea, where small subadult individuals occupied shallow nearshore habitats and size class of whales increased with increasing water depth. Timing of movements arriving to and moving through the observed area was also segregated by size. Small subadults arrived first in late August and departed in late September, and adults arrived last in late September. Mother—offspring pairs arrived in early September and were commonly observed until early October.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List, with the Sea of Okhotsk subpopulation classified as Endangered and the Spitsbergen subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. The Bowhead Whale traditionally has been divided into five subpopulations, or “putative stocks,” mainly based on geographic discontinuities: Baffin Bay—Davis Strait, Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin, Bering—Chuckchi-Beaufort Seas (BCB), Sea of Okhotsk, and Svalbard-Barents Sea (Spitsbergen). Nevertheless, recent satellite tracking and genetic data have resulted in combining Baffin Bay—Davis Strait and Hudson Bay—Foxe Basin into a single stock, which is now called the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stock. The Spitsbergen Bowhead Whales are found across the North Atlantic from off eastern Greenland (Denmark) in the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, and into the Kara Sea to Severnaya Zemlya (Russia), and south at least occasionally to northern Iceland and the coast of Norway and Jan Mayen (Norway). The stock of Bowhead Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk is restricted to the northern part of this region. During summer, these whales are mainly in waters south of Shantar Island and in spring in the gulfs of Gizhiginskaya and Penzhinskaya; during the winter, they live in polynyas (open water surrounded by ice) in the region. They are rare outside this region, but one stranding is known from Osaka Bay, Japan, in 1969. The largest and best known population of Bowhead Whales occurs in the BCB seas from Chaunskaya Bay (c.69° 21’N, 169° 46’E), Russia, in the western Chukchi Sea east to Amundsen Gulf in Canada, and in the northern Bering Sea south to Karaginskiy Bay near the base of Kamchatka Peninsula (c.59° 33’N, 164° 48°E), St. Matthew Island, Alaska. The newly combined Eastern Canada-Western Greenland population is found in summer in the Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin region in northern Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Foxe Channel, and Foxe Basin. In the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait region, Bowhead Whales spend summer in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago and off the east coast of Baffin Island. As ice forms in autumn, they are found in open water near the ice edge off West Greenland and eastern Baffin Island. Summering grounds include Cumberland Sound, and in late summer and autumn, their feeding grounds are in Isabella Bay, Lancaster Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and Eclipse Sound. In recent years, there has been some spatial overlap in the extreme summer ranges of the BCB and Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stocks. In 2006-2010, 58 Bowhead Whales from the BCB stock and West Greenland were tagged and tracked via satellite. Two of them entered the Northwest Passage in the Canadian High Arctic, one from the BCB stock and one from the opposite direction in West Greenland. They spent approximately ten days in the same area, demonstrating that there is at least some seasonal overlap between the two stocks. This overlap is the result of climate change that has opened the Northwest Passage to populations of Bowhead Whales previously separated by sea ice. The global population of Bowhead Whales is estimated at more than 24,000 individuals, with the majority of them found in the BCB stock. All stocks were greatly reduced by commercial whaling starting in 1610 in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Bowhead Whales are hunted today by indigenous Russian, Alaskan, Canadian, and Greenland hunters in subsistence fisheries that are closely monitored and have with annual quotas. More recently, the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stock is also increasing. Nevertheless, status of stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk and Svalbard-Barents Sea (Spitsbergen) in terms of actual numbers and any population growth remain unclear. The BCB stock has been increasing at least since the mid-1970s when a longterm monitoring program began. The BCB stock in spring 2011 was estimated at 16,892 individuals and from the mid-1970s to 2004, the stock increased 3-5% /year. The original BCB stock was estimated at 10,000-20,000 individuals. Therefore, the current stock is well within the range of its historic abundance. This stock is listed as a subpopulation on The IUCN Red List as Least Concern, the same as the overall listing for the species, because the BCB whales make up the majority of the world population of Bowhead Whales. The abundance estimate of the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland subpopulation was 6344 individuals in 2003, but the minimum original size of this stock was estimated at ¢.24,000 individuals. Therefore, the current stock is only c.25% ofits original numbers. This stock has not been assessed for The IUCN Red List. Current size of the subpopulation in the Sea of Okhotsk is poorly known. The only estimate, based on genetic mark-recapture data from 2000, is 247 individuals. During the 1960s,illegal Soviet pelagic whaling operations killed at least 145 Bowhead Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. Minimum pre-whaling number was estimated to be ¢.3000 individuals. Therefore, at best, the current stock is less than 10% ofits original size. There is no population estimate for the Spitsbergen stock, butit is thought to number under 100 individuals and there is limited evidence that it is increasing. The minimum pre-whaling size of the Spitsbergen stock was ¢.12,000 individuals. For all four subpopulations of Bowhead Whales, the primary potential threat is disturbance from oil and gas activities, which can decrease feeding efficiency. Other threats include bycatch from different types of fishing gear. How the future loss of sea ice due to climate change will affect Bowhead Whales is unknown, but ship strikes will no doubt increase as ship traffic and industrialization increase in their arctic habitat. Ship noise will also increase, and background noise masks calling among Bowhead Whales. As oil and gas activities increase, there is also an increased risk of oil spills. Oil would clearly be destructive to habitats of Bowhead Whales and increase their exposure to contaminants. Spilled oil would also matt their baleen plates, making it impossible for them to filter feed.","Alter et al. (2012) | Brandon & Wade (2004) | Burns et al. (1993) | Citta et al.

In summer, they generally occupy continental slope waters with moderate ice conditions. In autumn, Bowhead Whales occupy inner shelf waters with relatively light ice conditions. Food and Feeding. Stomach contents of Bowhead Whales have been well documented. Numerous prey species have been identified in their stomachs, but there is a clear preference for copepods (Calanus) and eupausiid krill. Mysid shrimps and gammarid amphipods are also sometimes prevalent in stomachs of Bowhead Whales. They skim the water’s surface to feed and also feed in the water column and at the seafloor. Bowhead Whales have been observed surface skimming synchronously, moving on their sides with mouths open, synchronously diving and surfacing while feeding, and cooperatively feeding, including in echelon formation. Typical feeding dives may last 5-15 minutes. Breeding. Breeding of the Bowhead Whale is thought to occurin late winter and early spring. Sexual activity has been observed throughout the year. Breeding is thoughtto involve sperm competition, and like right whales, mating groups are often composed of a single female with multiple males competing for access. Estimated gestation is 13— 14 months. Young are born in spring, with a peak in May. Young Bowhead Whales are 470-500 cm long at birth. Total length at one year of age is ¢.820 cm. Length at sexual maturity is estimated to be 1300-1350 cm for females and 1200-1300 cm for males. Activity patterns. Bowhead Whales are slow moving, and they are also observed breaching and fluke slapping at the surface. Flukes are lifted prior to deep dives. Data for eight Bowhead Whales equipped with satellite-monitored radio tags in the Beaufort and Chuckchi seas for approximately one month indicated that many dives were short, less than one minute in duration. Most dives were shallow to c¢.16 m. Five of the whales dove deeper than 100 m, with the deepest dive recorded at 352 m. Deeper dives, which occurred over the deep-water Mackenzie Canyon, were thought to be associated with feeding behavior. Bowhead Whales may be capable of dives with durations of up to approximately one hour. They can break through ice of ¢.60 cm thick and may sometimes make their way through ice floes in this manner. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Seasonal distribution and movements of Bowhead Whales are closely associated with changes in cover of sea ice. They migrate to high Arctic latitudes in summer and return to more marginal ice areas during maximum ice in winter, traveling seasonally between high-productivity areas of densely concentrated prey species. Data from satellite monitoring of nine radio-tagged whales off West Greenland indicated localized use of a single site for 3-6 weeks between long-distance, offshore movements that lasted 1-2 weeks. Travel velocity was up to 200 km/day, which was considered too rapid for foraging to be feasible during these long-distance movements. It has been suggested that Bowhead Whales meet their energetic needs during intense feeding periods; their large body size combined with blubber stores may accommodate the energy needed to survive variability in pelagic productivity and allow for long-distance travel between regions of greater prey availability. Bowhead Whales are generally observed individually or in groups of up to three. Larger groups are observed during migration, and like right whales, Bowhead Whales form large aggregations on feeding grounds. Segregation by sex has been documented in Bowhead Whales. For example, mature females without offspring are thought to occupy Disko Bay, whereas primarily female—offspring pairs are observed in Foxe Basin. Baffin Bay is commonly occupied by adult males and by resting or pregnant females from Disko Bay. Prince Regent, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and north-western Hudson Bay, Canada, are used by nursing females, their offspring, and subadults. It has been suggested that mature females (without young) use Disko Bay as a feeding ground during phases of the reproductive cycle. Interestingly, acoustic recordings of singing individuals may indicate that breeding occurs in Disko Bay, and males may be following estrous females into the area. Segregation by size class of Bowhead Whales has been observed in the Central Beaufort Sea, where small subadult individuals occupied shallow nearshore habitats and size class of whales increased with increasing water depth. Timing of movements arriving to and moving through the observed area was also segregated by size. Small subadults arrived first in late August and departed in late September, and adults arrived last in late September. Mother—offspring pairs arrived in early September and were commonly observed until early October. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List, with the Sea of Okhotsk subpopulation classified as Endangered and the Spitsbergen subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. The Bowhead Whale traditionally has been divided into five subpopulations, or “putative stocks,” mainly based on geographic discontinuities: Baffin Bay—Davis Strait, Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin, Bering—Chuckchi-Beaufort Seas (BCB), Sea of Okhotsk, and Svalbard-Barents Sea (Spitsbergen). Nevertheless, recent satellite tracking and genetic data have resulted in combining Baffin Bay—Davis Strait and Hudson Bay—Foxe Basin into a single stock, which is now called the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stock. The Spitsbergen Bowhead Whales are found across the North Atlantic from off eastern Greenland (Denmark) in the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, and into the Kara Sea to Severnaya Zemlya (Russia), and south at least occasionally to northern Iceland and the coast of Norway and Jan Mayen (Norway). The stock of Bowhead Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk is restricted to the northern part of this region. During summer, these whales are mainly in waters south of Shantar Island and in spring in the gulfs of Gizhiginskaya and Penzhinskaya; during the winter, they live in polynyas (open water surrounded by ice) in the region. They are rare outside this region, but one stranding is known from Osaka Bay, Japan, in 1969. The largest and best known population of Bowhead Whales occurs in the BCB seas from Chaunskaya Bay (c.69° 21’N, 169° 46’E), Russia, in the western Chukchi Sea east to Amundsen Gulf in Canada, and in the northern Bering Sea south to Karaginskiy Bay near the base of Kamchatka Peninsula (c.59° 33’N, 164° 48°E), St. Matthew Island, Alaska. The newly combined Eastern Canada-Western Greenland population is found in summer in the Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin region in northern Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Foxe Channel, and Foxe Basin. In the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait region, Bowhead Whales spend summer in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago and off the east coast of Baffin Island. As ice forms in autumn, they are found in open water near the ice edge off West Greenland and eastern Baffin Island. Summering grounds include Cumberland Sound, and in late summer and autumn, their feeding grounds are in Isabella Bay, Lancaster Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and Eclipse Sound. In recent years, there has been some spatial overlap in the extreme summer ranges of the BCB and Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stocks. In 2006-2010, 58 Bowhead Whales from the BCB stock and West Greenland were tagged and tracked via satellite. Two of them entered the Northwest Passage in the Canadian High Arctic, one from the BCB stock and one from the opposite direction in West Greenland. They spent approximately ten days in the same area, demonstrating that there is at least some seasonal overlap between the two stocks. This overlap is the result of climate change that has opened the Northwest Passage to populations of Bowhead Whales previously separated by sea ice. The global population of Bowhead Whales is estimated at more than 24,000 individuals, with the majority of them found in the BCB stock. All stocks were greatly reduced by commercial whaling starting in 1610 in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Bowhead Whales are hunted today by indigenous Russian, Alaskan, Canadian, and Greenland hunters in subsistence fisheries that are closely monitored and have with annual quotas. More recently, the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stock is also increasing. Nevertheless, status of stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk and Svalbard-Barents Sea (Spitsbergen) in terms of actual numbers and any population growth remain unclear. The BCB stock has been increasing at least since the mid-1970s when a longterm monitoring program began. The BCB stock in spring 2011 was estimated at 16,892 individuals and from the mid-1970s to 2004, the stock increased 3-5% /year. The original BCB stock was estimated at 10,000-20,000 individuals. Therefore, the current stock is well within the range of its historic abundance. This stock is listed as a subpopulation on The IUCN Red List as Least Concern, the same as the overall listing for the species, because the BCB whales make up the majority of the world population of Bowhead Whales. The abundance estimate of the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland subpopulation was 6344 individuals in 2003, but the minimum original size of this stock was estimated at ¢.24,000 individuals. Therefore, the current stock is only c.25% ofits original numbers. This stock has not been assessed for The IUCN Red List. Current size of the subpopulation in the Sea of Okhotsk is poorly known. The only estimate, based on genetic mark-recapture data from 2000, is 247 individuals. During the 1960s,illegal Soviet pelagic whaling operations killed at least 145 Bowhead Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. Minimum pre-whaling number was estimated to be ¢.3000 individuals. Therefore, at best, the current stock is less than 10% ofits original size. There is no population estimate for the Spitsbergen stock, butit is thought to number under 100 individuals and there is limited evidence that it is increasing. The minimum pre-whaling size of the Spitsbergen stock was ¢.12,000 individuals. For all four subpopulations of Bowhead Whales, the primary potential threat is disturbance from oil and gas activities, which can decrease feeding efficiency. Other threats include bycatch from different types of fishing gear. How the future loss of sea ice due to climate change will affect Bowhead Whales is unknown, but ship strikes will no doubt increase as ship traffic and industrialization increase in their arctic habitat. Ship noise will also increase, and background noise masks calling among Bowhead Whales. As oil and gas activities increase, there is also an increased risk of oil spills. Oil would clearly be destructive to habitats of Bowhead Whales and increase their exposure to contaminants. Spilled oil would also matt their baleen plates, making it impossible for them to filter feed. Bibliography. Alter et al. (2012), Brandon & Wade (2004), Burns et al. (1993), Citta et al.

Harbor Porpoises are small cetaceans, growing to a maximum length of only ¢.200 cm. Most adults are less than 180 cm long. Body is robust, with small appendages. There are small tubercles (or denticles) on the leading edge of the dorsal fin and sometimes also on flippers. Beak is very short and poorly defined, and dorsalfin is low, triangular, and wide-based. Color pattern is somewhat bland at first appearance, but it is actually more complex when analyzed in detail. Body is generally counter-shaded, with a dark gray back and white belly. Generally, dark and pale regions blend into each other, but margins between the two are often splotchy and streaked. Appendages are all dark, and there is a dark stripe running from gape to flipper, and there are also dark streaks on the lower jaw. There is a great deal of individual variation in color pattern, but no obvious differences among different populations have been identified. Thirty-four records of anomalously white individuals (three patterns have been observed, some perhaps albinos) have been recorded in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Newborns have a muted color pattern, generally of subdued tones of dark and pale gray. Tooth counts generally are 19-28 in each half of each jaw.","Shallow waters throughout the temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere, over the continental shelf, and usually near shore, although Harbor Porpoises may travel quite far from shore in some places and have been recorded in deep waters between land masses. They may also occur in deep waters in some inshore regions, such as in south-eastern Alaska, but only where there are shallow waters nearby. Habitat of the Harbor Porpoise is cool temperate to subpolar waters, generally with low water temperatures.","Harbor Porpoises are opportunistic feeders, although their main prey appears to vary on regional and seasonal scales. In the North Atlantic, they feed primarily on clupeoids and gadoids, while in the North Pacific, they prey largely on engraulids and scorpaenids. They eat a wide variety offish and cephalopods, although the diet in any specific area may be dominated by just a few species. Harbor Porpoises feed heavily on small schooling fish that occur in the water column, such as herring and sprat ( Clupeidae ), capelin (Mallotus), hake (Merluccius), and mackerel ( Scomber , Scombridae ); they also consume market squid ( Loligo ) in some areas. Although many of these prey species occur in the water column, many of the other prey species are benthic or demersal. Benthic invertebrates are sometimes also consumed, but these are generally considered to be secondarily ingested. In the north-eastern Atlantic, there has apparently been a long-term shift from predation on declining stocks of clupeid fish (mainly herring, Clupea harengus ) to sand lance ( Ammodytidae ) and gadoid fish.","Reproductive biology of the Harbor Porpoise has been studied more extensively than for any other member of the family, due to the large number of specimens that have been available from strandings and incidental catches in fisheries. Mating system of the Harbor Porpoise is thought to be promiscuous. Anatomical evidence (Harbor Porpoises have some of the largest testes relative to body mass of any mammal species) has for some time suggested that sperm competition may be the primary way that males compete to inseminate females. Recent behavioral observations of Harbor Porpoises in the San Francisco Bay area (USA) appear to support this idea. Young are typically born in April-August (late spring through mid-summer), after gestation of ¢.10-11 months. Offspring are weaned before they reach one year of age. Sexual maturity occurs at 3—4 years of age and lengths of 120-150 cm. There is geographic variation in these parameters among different populations, and densitydependent variation has also been documented. Harbor Porpoises regularly interbreed and produce hybrids with Dall’s Porpoises ( Phocoenoides dalli ) in the inshore waters of the Pacific Northwest (Washington State, USA and southern British Columbia, Canada) and occasionally elsewhere where the two species are sympatric. It is virtually always the case that the mother is a Dall’s Porpoise and the father is a Harbor Porpoise, and this is what would be predicted, based on their respective mating systems (Dall’s are considered polygynous, with males apparently not using sperm competition, but guarding females to prevent insemination by other males). Harbor Porpoiseslive into their 20s, although in some areas most individuals may die before they reach twelve years of age.","Harbor Porpoises are shy and unobtrusive animals, with a low surfacing profile and not a great deal of aerial behavior. They do not ride bow waves of vessels, and in many cases, they appear to actively avoid motorized vessels. There are exceptions to this, and at least in the San Francisco Bay area, they may be more approachable. These individuals sometimes lie nearly motionless at the surface for several seconds, and it is not clear why they do this. The typical surfacing pattern is a slow roll, in which the individual does not create any splash. At times, they do move faster and surface with a sloppy splash (this is called “pop-splashing,” and the splash looks very different from the more V-shaped splash of a rooster-tailing Dall’s Porpoise). Diving behavior of Harbor Porpoises has been studied with time-depth recording tags. Although most dives last less than one minute, Harbor Porpoises have been found to be capable of diving to depths of at least 220 m and for periods of more than five minutes.","Singles or small groups of less than a half-dozen Harbor Porpoises are most commonly seen, although they do aggregate, at times, into loose groupings of 50 to several hundred individuals. This occurs mostly when feeding on an aggregated food source or during migration, and these large groups generally have little structure. Movement patterns of individual Harbor Porpoises are not very well known, but it is known that they are capable of large-scale movements of many hundreds to thousands of kilometers. On the other hand, repeated sightings of identifiable individuals in San Francisco Bay show that some populations may have more limited movements. Not much is known about social organization of Harbor Porpoises, but most bonds outside the mother—offspring pair appear to be weak, and there do not seem to be any other long-term associations.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [IUCN Red List. The subspecies relicta is classified as Endangered, and the Baltic Sea population, which only numbers ¢.500-600 individuals,is classified as Critically Endangered. Other subspecies have not been evaluated separately on The IUCN Red List. There has been a long and somewhat tragic history of human interactions with Harbor Porpoises. Hunting has occurred in many different parts ofits distribution, especially in northern European waters. Major hunts have occurred in the Black Sea, Baltic Sea, and the Bay of Fundy, and in the waters off western Greenland (the latter is still active). Many of these caused depletion of local populations. More recently, bycatch from fisheries, especially in various forms of gillnets or trammel nets, has been responsible for threatening existence of populations throughout the distribution of the Harbor Porpoise. The largest mortality has occurred in fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, western Greenland, North Sea, and Celtic Shelf, but smaller kills have occurred almost everywhere the Harbor Porpoise occurs. It is believed that Harbor Porpoises can normally detect gillnets at distances necessary to avoid entanglement, but accidents may happen due to attention shifts or auditory masking. Use of acoustic alarms (“pingers”) and other mitigation measures have managed to reduce mortality in many areas, but the only way to eliminate bycatch completely is to eliminate gillnets. Catches of Harbor Porpoises in trawls, set nets, herring weirs, pound nets, cod traps, and even anti-submarine nets have also been documented and have taken their toll. Other threats include detrimental effects of environmental contaminants, vessel traffic, anthropogenic noise impacts, prey depletion, and habitat deterioration or destruction. The Harbor Porpoise is not rare and not endangered. Globally, there may be more than 675,000 Harbor Porpoises. Nevertheless, particular populations in many areas have been impacted by human activities and quite a few of these are indeed threatened and in need of protection.","Amano (1996) | Andersen et al.

More recently, bycatch from fisheries, especially in various forms of gillnets or trammel nets, has been responsible for threatening existence of populations throughout the distribution of the Harbor Porpoise. The largest mortality has occurred in fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, western Greenland, North Sea, and Celtic Shelf, but smaller kills have occurred almost everywhere the Harbor Porpoise occurs. It is believed that Harbor Porpoises can normally detect gillnets at distances necessary to avoid entanglement, but accidents may happen due to attention shifts or auditory masking. Use of acoustic alarms (“pingers”) and other mitigation measures have managed to reduce mortality in many areas, but the only way to eliminate bycatch completely is to eliminate gillnets. Catches of Harbor Porpoises in trawls, set nets, herring weirs, pound nets, cod traps, and even anti-submarine nets have also been documented and have taken their toll. Other threats include detrimental effects of environmental contaminants, vessel traffic, anthropogenic noise impacts, prey depletion, and habitat deterioration or destruction. The Harbor Porpoise is not rare and not endangered. Globally, there may be more than 675,000 Harbor Porpoises. Nevertheless, particular populations in many areas have been impacted by human activities and quite a few of these are indeed threatened and in need of protection. Bibliography.

Dall’s Porpoise is the largest member of the family, reaching lengths of up to 240 cm for males and 220 cm for females. It is very stocky, with a very small head and small appendages. There is a very slight, poorly defined beak. Dorsal fin is wide-based and triangular, and in males,it is extremely canted forward. Tailstock is deepened, exceedingly in adult males. Flukes may have a convex trailing edge, especially in adult males. Color pattern is contrasting black and white, with a large, ventrally continuous, white flank patch (extending farther forward in the subspecies truei) and white frosting on upper margins of dorsal fin and trailing edge of flukes. In newborns, color pattern is muted, consisting of various shades of gray, and frosting on fin and flukes is absent. Color pattern becomes bolder as individuals age, and frosting (or trim) begins to appear in the first year of age. Tooth counts generally are 23-28 in each half of each jaw.","Deep, cold waters. Dall’s Porpoises are generally found far offshore, but they do occur in nearshore waters where there is water deeper than 100-200 m nearby. They are commonly seen in the inshore waters of north-western USA (Washington, Alaska) and west Canada (British Columbia), where they inhabit deep channels and passes.","Dall’s Porpoises are opportunistic feeders, taking a wide variety of prey items. These include mostly mid-water and surface-living fish and cephalopods, such as herring ( Clupea ), anchovies ( Engraulis ), sardines ( Sardinops , Clupeidae ), hake (Merluccius), sauries ( Cololabis , Scomberesocidae ), lanternfish ( Myctophidae ), and gonatid squid ( Gonatidae ). They occasionally consume invertebrates such as krill, decapods, and various species of shrimps, but these latter items are not considered to be their primary prey.","Dall’s Porpoise is a seasonal breeder, with all populations known to have a very strong birthing peak in summer. Age and length at sexual maturity appear to vary among different populations, but they generally occur at 4-7 years of age and lengths of 170-190 cm for females and 3-5-8 years and 180-200 cm for males. Gestation lasts c.11 months, and offspring are generally nursed for less than one year. Mating system of Dall’s Porpoise is strongly polygynous, with males apparently using their sexually dimorphic morphologic characters to compete directly for females, and then guarding the female from other potential suitors. In inshore waters of Washington, where they overlap in distribution with Harbor Porpoises ( Phocoena phocoena ), the two species regularly appear to interbreed and produce hybrids, and this also is known to occur elsewhere in their distributions. In these cases, a Dall’s Porpoise is generally the maternal parent. Longevity is rarely much greater than 20 years.","Dall’s Porpoise is an active, energetic species. It may be the fastest swimmer of the cetaceans, at least for short bursts. They are most frequently seen swimming very quickly and throwing up a large V-shaped rooster-tail of spray as they surface to breathe at high speed, bringing only very little of their body above the surface. When riding bow waves of vessels, which they do frequently, they rooster-tail on virtually every surfacing, but at other times, they slow down and surface in a slow roll, with no splash. Breaching, spy hopping, and other types of aerial displays are not common, and they very rarely porpoise completely clear of the water.","Dall’s Porpoises are most commonly found as singletons and pairs, or in small groups of up to a dozen. They occasionally gather in large groups of several dozens or even hundreds (although these opportunistic aggregations do not have any particular structure). Groups of up to several thousand have been reported, but there is some doubt as to correct species identification in these cases. Seasonal movements of population segments of Dall’s Porpoises are known, with increased densities near shore and in more southern areas in winter, and corresponding northern and offshore shifts in summer. Little is known about home ranges or movements of individual Dall’s Porpoises because specimens have rarely been identified, either through photo-identification studies or tagging work. Based on what little is known, however, it would appear that they can undergorather extensive movements of at least several hundred kilometers in pelagic portions of their distribution.","CITES Appendix II.

Of the two species of finless porpoise, the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise is the larger species, with a total body length up to 227 cm, although this may be an outlier because most specimens are much smaller. There is no dorsal fin, but the tubercled patch is narrow, 0.2-1.2 cm, occasionally up to 2-4 cm, in width at its widest point. Dorsal ridge is high (up to 5:5 cm), is covered with 1-10 rows of tubercles, and originates at or anterior to the mid-length of the back. There is no beak, and head is blunt, with a steep forehead. Especially in the Yangtze River, body of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise has a very soft and “mushy” texture, different from most cetaceans. Coloration tends to be much paler than in the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise ( N. phocaenoides ). Adults range from pale cream to dark gray, but they are a moderate shade of gray in most populations. Newborns are dark gray and get paler as they age. Compared with their congeners, skull of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise has a relatively long and narrow rostrum (length 77-97 mm, with a mean of 86-8 mm). Adult condylobasal skull lengths are 210-295 mm. Teeth are small, and tooth counts in each half of each jaw are 16-21 in the upper row and 15-20 in the lower row.","Shallow, temperate waters of eastern Asia. Both marine and fresh waters are inhabited, and there is a population of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises found exclusively in the freshwaters of China’s largestriver, the Yangtze. Althoughit tends to occur mostly very near shore, it has a greater tendency than the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise to be found in offshore waters. Shallow, offshore (more than 240 km from shore, but less than 200 m deep) regions of the Yellow and Bohai seas are inhabited by the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise.","Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises feed on a wide variety of small marine organisms, some of which are pelagic; others are benthic or demersal. Its prey includes fish (families such as Apogonidae , Carangiade , Clupeidae , Sparidae , Engraulidae , Sciaenidae , Gobiidae , and Atherinidae ), cephalopods ( Octopodidae , Sepiidae , Sepiolidae , and Loliginidae ), and crustaceans (mostly shrimps). Available data also indicate that Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Yangtze River feed on fish and shrimps.","Life history of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise has been relatively well studied, largely due to the abundance of specimens available from large bycatches in various fisheries. Newborns are ¢.73-79 cm long and are born mostly in spring and summer, although births in some populations can occur in autumn and winter. Sexual maturity of males occurs at 3-6 years of age and lengths of 132-145 cm, and at c.4-6 years and 132-140 cm for females, with some variation among populations. Gestation lasts ¢.10-11 months.

There are reports of mother porpoises carrying young on their backs (supposedly with the offspring lying on the roughened dorsal ridge), but these reports are somewhat questionable.

Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The nominate subspecies asiaeorientalis is classified as Critically Endangered, and the subspecies sunameri has not been evaluated separately on The IUCN Red List. Vulnerable status is due to observed population declines and inferred reductions of at least 30% in the past three generations. In particular, populations in the Yangtze River and the Inland Sea ofJapan have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades, and the future of both populationsis in serious doubt. Although the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise has an extensive distribution, no global assessment of abundance has been attempted. There are, however, thought to be somewhat more than 1800 individuals in the Yangtze River and 5000-10,000 individuals in 5-6 different populations in Japanese waters. In the Yellow Sea of Korea, c.21,500 individuals were estimated to occur in offshore waters and ¢.5500 in coastal waters, but these estimates are thought to be low. They are faced with a number of threats, including destruction of habitat from coastal development, disturbance from vessel traffic and other coastal activities, vessel strikes, and various forms of pollution and noise disturbance. As for the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise, the major threat to the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise may come from entanglement in equipment of various fisheries, especially those using gillnets and related trammel nets.","Akamatsu et al.

Its classification as Vulnerable was due to observed population declines and inferred reductions of at least 30% in the past three generations. Although it has an extensive distribution throughout south-eastern Asia, and there are clearly many thousands of Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises, no global population assessment has been attempted. A number of threats face the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise, including destruction of habitat from coastal development, disturbance from vessel traffic and other coastal activities, vessel strikes, and various forms of pollution. The major threat, however, comes from entanglement in equipment of variousfisheries, especially gillnets, and this may be threatening the viability of some populations. The population that occurs in waters near Hong Kong is one of the only ones for which robust estimates of abundance have been made, and it appears to number at least 220 individuals. About 1400 Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoises occur in waters off Bangladesh. Bibliography. Amano (2009), Amano et al. (1992), Fajardo-Mellor et al.

Deltaic waters, particularly in the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, are also important habitat, and although very occasionally sightings are reported in nearshore marine waters they generally do not occur in salinities greater than 10 ppt.","South Asian River Dolphins feed on a large variety of freshwater bottom-dwelling prawns, fish, and crustaceans including catfish (Wallago attu and Sperata aor), carp (Catla catla and Cirrhinus cirrhosus) and freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium rosenbergii and M. malcolmsonii).","Females become sexually mature at about eight years of age, and gestation lasts for about one year. Offspring are born during winter or spring and are weaned at about one year of age or before. The breeding cycle is likely two years. Sexual maturity is achieved at around ten years. The oldest individual recorded was a 28year-old male, but it is estimated that animals may live to ¢.35 years.","South Asian River Dolphins surface rapidly and unpredictably, spending only c.1 second at the surface. Very little is known about the behavior of the South Asian River Dolphin because of their short surface interval and the inability to observe them in the turbid water they inhabit.","South Asian River Dolphins are believed to shift their distributions with seasonal changes in river discharge; individuals move upstream and into smaller rivers when rivers are swollen during the summer monsoon and move into the mainstream of larger rivers in the dry season when discharge is low. In many places, dams or irrigation barrages now block these seasonal movements. Individuals occur primarily alone or in small groups, but occasionally in aggregations of 20 or more. Individuals and groups often surface in the same location for periods of at least 30 minutes. There is no specific information available on social organization or home range.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List, including both subspecies. Dams and irrigation barrages fragment populations of the South Asian River Dolphin, and its distribution is contracting, especially in the smaller rivers in the northern part of the distributional range. Eleven of 17 subpopulations of the Indus River Dolphin have been extirpated, and only six populations remain, isolated between barrages; three are estimated to have less than 20 individuals each and are probably too small to persist, leaving only three that may be viable in the long-term. The largest population of the Indus River Dolphin is in northern Sindh Province between Guddu and Sukkur barrages. In 2001, this subspecies was estimated to number ¢.1300 individuals and may have been increasing since dolphin hunting ceased in the 1970s. In 2006, the Indus River Dolphin was estimated to number 1550— 1750 individuals. Given its much larger range, the Ganges River Dolphin is likely to be more abundant than the Indus River Dolphin, and there may be several thousand individuals. Significant portions of its range have not been surveyed; however, B. D. Smith and colleagues estimated 255 individuals in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh in 2006. Its major threats are likely population fragmentation, depleted dry-season river flows, and incidental capture in fishing gear. Reduced flows concentrate South Asian River Dolphins, pollutants, and human activities and exacerbate many anthropogenic threats.","Anderson (1879) | Arnason et al. (2004) | Bashir et al.

Very little is known about the behavior of the South Asian River Dolphin because of their short surface interval and the inability to observe them in the turbid water they inhabit. Movements, Home range and Social organization. South Asian River Dolphins are believed to shift their distributions with seasonal changes in river discharge; individuals move upstream and into smaller rivers when rivers are swollen during the summer monsoon and move into the mainstream of larger rivers in the dry season when discharge is low. In many places, dams or irrigation barrages now block these seasonal movements. Individuals occur primarily alone or in small groups, but occasionally in aggregations of 20 or more. Individuals and groups often surface in the same location for periods of at least 30 minutes. There is no specific information available on social organization or home range. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List, including both subspecies. Dams and irrigation barrages fragment populations of the South Asian River Dolphin, and its distribution is contracting, especially in the smaller rivers in the northern part of the distributional range. Eleven of 17 subpopulations of the Indus River Dolphin have been extirpated, and only six populations remain, isolated between barrages; three are estimated to have less than 20 individuals each and are probably too small to persist, leaving only three that may be viable in the long-term. The largest population of the Indus River Dolphin is in northern Sindh Province between Guddu and Sukkur barrages. In 2001, this subspecies was estimated to number ¢.1300 individuals and may have been increasing since dolphin hunting ceased in the 1970s. In 2006, the Indus River Dolphin was estimated to number 1550— 1750 individuals. Given its much larger range, the Ganges River Dolphin is likely to be more abundant than the Indus River Dolphin, and there may be several thousand individuals. Significant portions of its range have not been surveyed; however, B. D. Smith and colleagues estimated 255 individuals in the Sundarbans of Bangladesh in 2006. Its major threats are likely population fragmentation, depleted dry-season river flows, and incidental capture in fishing gear. Reduced flows concentrate South Asian River Dolphins, pollutants, and human activities and exacerbate many anthropogenic threats. Bibliography. Anderson (1879), Arnason et al. (2004), Bashir et al.

Extinct in the N Atlantic Ocean.","Total length 1300-1420 cm; weight 14,000-35,000 kg. There are no morphological differences among individuals of the eastern and western populations of Gray Whales. The Gray Whale is a medium-sized baleen or “mysticete” whale that can reach a maximum length of 1530 cm. Females are slightly larger than males at all ages. Distance from genitalslit to anus is wider in males; there are no othersignificant differences in external appearance between sexes. Body color ranges from mottled pale gray to dark gray with whitish to cream-colored blotches. White scars accumulate over time and add to distinctive individual color patterns. Gray Whales are heavily infested with species-specific barnacles (Cryptolepas rachianecti), and three species of cyamids or “whale lice” (Cyamus scammoni, C. ceti, and C. kessleri). Neonates are 450-500 cm long and can weigh 800 kg or more. Head is moderately arched and triangular when viewed from above and averages 20% of total length. Double nares or “blowholes,” characteristic of mysticete whales, are located on top of head just above and anterior to neck. The Gray Whale’s “blow,” or exhalation, is vertical and heart-shaped to columnar in form. Throat possesses 2-7 pleats that allow expansion of mouth cavity during feeding. Gray Whale baleen is pale yellow with ¢.130-180 individual plates, 5-40 cm long, on each side of upperjaw. Back is smooth from base of head to anterior section oftail, where instead of a dorsal fin, an elongated hump followed by a series of bumps or “knuckles” runs along dorsal edge oftailstock. Anterior flippers are paddleshaped and pointed at their tips. Flukes are butterflyshaped with pointed tips and average 300-360 cm from tip to tip. Gray Whales possess a unique “tailstock cyst” of unknown function located on the anterior ventral surface of the caudal peduncle.","Primarily relatively shallow waters along edges of continental shelves from subtropical to polar latitudes and only occasionally open oceanic or pelagic habitats. Gray Whales frequent continental shelf waters along both sides of the North Pacific Ocean, including East China Sea, Yellow Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Chukchi, Beaufort, and East Siberian seas in the Arctic Ocean. Gray Whales are highly migratory. When migrating, they may cross deep ocean and follow undersea mountain ranges and escarpments. In summer, they feed on the bottom of shallow continental shelves in high latitudes. In fall and spring, the western population of Gray Whalesis believed to migrate along the Pacific coast of the Far East from Russia to China. The larger eastern population migrates along the edge of the continental shelf of the Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Mexico. In winter, Gray Whales congregate in coastal bays and lagoons that afford them protection from predation and warmer water for rearing young and mating. Their habit of frequenting relatively shallow continental shelf waters and coastal areas for feeding, migrating, and breeding is unique among mysticete whales. While capable of navigating deep ocean areas, Gray Whales migrate to and from their summer feeding and winter breeding areas along distinct corridors that follow within a few kilometers of the North American coast (for the eastern Gray Whale) and the eastern Asian coast (for some of the western Gray Whales). They disperse widely across the Arctic and polar seas during summer feeding, and they aggregate in shallow coastal areas, embayments and lagoons in subtropical latitudes for breeding and to give birth.","Primary summer feeding grounds of Gray Whales include the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, East Siberian Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk, and they also exploit prey resources where they are found throughout their migratory distribution. They forage for patchy concentrations of prey found on relatively shallow (50 m or less) continental shelf areas that correspond with areas of high primary productivity supporting extensive benthic invertebrate communities. Gray Whales use suction feeding to exploit prey from the sea floor, but they can also feed on swimming prey by gulping and skimming prey from near the sea floor and ocean surface. Principal prey includes infaunal, tube-dwelling ampeliscid amphipods, polychaete worms, bivalves, swarming cumaceans, mysids, shrimps, krill, mobile amphipods, and shoals of clupeoid fish such as sardines and anchovies. An adult Gray Whale may consume ¢.220,800 kg of food at a rate of ¢.1200 kg/day for c.180 feeding days. Gray Whales do not feed extensively, or at all, during fall and spring migrations or while in their winter breeding areas. Fasting whales may lose up to 30% of their body fat during winter. This is especially critical for lactating females that are not feeding while nursing and caring for their offspring. Water is obtained from their food and metabolically from body fat. Warming of the Arctic Ocean due to global climate change and subsequent reduction in permanent sea ice has accelerated in recent decades and has affected distributions and availabilities of traditional prey communities. Some historical feeding areas of Gray Whales have declined in size, but it is possible that new prey communities will become established in other areas where oceanic and ice conditions are favorable. Gray Whales are responding by foraging over broader areas and staying longer in their summer feeding areas to obtain sufficient food and energy stores for winter migration and breeding. Flexibility in feeding modes and prey selection of the Gray Whale has allowed it to survive over many Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods in the geologic past. Its abilities to use alternative prey and feeding areas are advantages for dealing with climate-driven oceanographic changes. Although switching prey has the advantage of providing additional feeding options, it may also create competition with other marine species that exploit the same resources.","Male and female Gray Whales reached sexual maturity at 6-12 years of age. Mating and birthing are strongly seasonal and synchronized with the migratory cycle. Mating occurs during the middle of the fall southward migration and continues in January-February on the winter breeding range. Gray Whales are thought to have a “promiscuous” mating system in which females and males copulate with multiple partners. Individuals may mate in pairs and in groups of up to 20 or more whales. Mating groups are physically active and fluid, with individuals joining and leaving. Sometimes there are high-speed chases interrupted by mating bouts that last from a few minutes to hours. Males may attempt to mate with females that have newborn young, but females with young usually reject breeding males. Little overt competition has been observed among males, and multiple inseminations likely occur. Thus,it is thought that sperm competition operates in the Gray Whale instead of physical aggression to increase chances of an individual male’s fathering a young. Females invest heavily in rearing a limited number of offspring during their lifetimes, whereas males maximize their reproductive success by mating with as many females as possible. Gestation is 11-13 months, with females normally bearing one offspring at intervals of two years, but longer intervals may occur. Births occur from late December to early March, with the median in late January, when near-term females are in or near breeding grounds or migrating southward. Young are weaned and separate from their mothers at c.7-9 months of age during spring migration or on summer feeding grounds. Gray Whales are physically mature at c.40 years. The longevity record is one female killed in the 1960s who had lived as long as 80 years.","Gray Whales migrate continuously day and night at 6-7 km/h, pausing only to catnap, forage, or mate. On average, swimming Gray Whales will surface every b—7 minutes between long dives and take 3-5 breaths at 15-30second intervals before submerging to resume swimming. Before beginning a long dive and after a sequence of breaths, tail flukes are frequently raised above the water’s surface. Aerial behaviors include “breaching” (jumping out of the water), “spy hopping” (raising head vertically out of the water), “tail stands” (holding flukes and tailstock vertically above water’s surface), and “lobtailing” (slapping water’s surface with flukes). Gray Whales forage continuously on their Arctic feeding grounds during long periods of daylight characteristic of these high-latitude areas in summer. During the winter breeding season, courting Gray Whales are continuously active, rarely resting at the water’s surface. In contrast, females that are nursing newborns move about breeding lagoons with their offspring and frequently rest or “sleep” at the surface while their offspring continue to swim around them and nurse. Young appear to be active at all times, never resting or sleeping.","Gray Whales in the eastern North Pacific Ocean are latitudinal migrants, engaging in an annual polar-to-subtropical migration in fall and a spring return migration to polar seas. Their round trip of 15,000-20,000 km spans 55° of latitude, and it is the longest migration of any mysticete. They exit Arctic and Bering seas from mid-Novemberto late December, following the North American coast southward to coastal Mexico and arriving there in January-February. Southward and northward migrants overlap in midwinter along the southern part of their winter range, which spans coastal waters from southern California to Mexico. Pregnant females and females with new offspring arrive in the Mexican portion of the winter range from late December to earlyJanuary, with the bulk of the population arriving by mid-February to early March. The principal winter gathering areas include Laguna Ojo de Liebre (also known as Scammon’s Lagoon), Bahia de Sebastian Vizcaino, Laguna San Ignacio, Bahia de Ballenas, and Bahia Magdalena and adjacent waters. Newly pregnant females lead the spring northward migration of eastern Gray Whales, followed by adult females and males, and then juveniles. Mothers with young are the last to leave the breeding range; they remain the longest to allow young to grow and strengthen before migrating. The western and eastern populations of Gray Whales were thought to be separate and distinct groups, but recent research indicates that they share feeding grounds along the eastern coast of Kamchatka and some western Gray Whales migrate across the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean and join the larger eastern population’s migration along the west coast of North America. Gray Whales from the western population have also been photographed in breeding lagoons of the eastern population. Sharing migration routes and winter breeding areas suggests that interbreeding of these two populations occurs. Incidental catches and strandings of Gray Whales offJapan support the contention that some western Gray Whales continue to migrate along the Asian coast and winter off the China coast. The fossil record suggests that eschrichtiids evolved in the Mediterranean or North Atlantic Ocean during the Miocene or earliest Pliocene, and dispersed westward into the Pacific through the then-open Central American Seaway, later dispersing back into the North Atlantic during the Pleistocene, as evidenced by subfossil remains found along the North Atlantic coasts of North America. Support for this hypothesis occurred in May 2010, when a single Gray Whale was observed off the Mediterranean coasts of Israel and Spain, and again in May 2013 when another single Gray Whale was sighted off the Namibia coast. Apparently they had migrated from the North Pacific into the Arctic Ocean, followed the northern Eurasian coast, continued along the European coast and on to the Mediterranean and the Namibia coast. Appearance of Gray Whales in the Atlantic demonstrates that such exchanges between oceans are possible during periods of interglacial minimum ice conditions. Shrinking of Arctic sea ice due to climate change suggests that Gray Whales could recolonize the North Atlantic as ice and temperature barriers to mixing between the northern North Atlantic and the North Pacific biomes are reduced. Gray Whales are not known to be social, but they do form loose aggregations on feeding grounds and during migrations. There is no evidence of social bonding other than during copulation and between mother—offspring pairs. Gray Whales disperse widely across their principal feeding areas in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Arctic Ocean to forage for prey. Breeding males do not defend territories, show aggression toward conspecifics, or defend female “harems.” Male Gray Whales provide no parental care or assistance with rearing young. Females remain solitary when their offspring are young. They form aggregations within breeding lagoons when young are 2—4 months old. In these groups, a mother—offspring pair will cavort with other mother—offspring pairs, mixing and milling among them, perhaps socializing with each other. Females with young migrate alone rather than in groups, perhaps to minimize detection by predators.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population in the western North Pacific Ocean is classified as Critically Endangered. The eastern population of the Gray Whale ranges from the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea feeding grounds south along the western coast of North America to their winter aggregation and breeding areas along the Pacific coast of Baja California, the Gulf of California, and parts of the mainland coast of Mexico, numbering ¢.21,000 individuals in 2009. The western population is only ¢.120-130 individuals and feeds along the northern shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, off Sakhalin Island, and the eastern coast of Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia; their breeding areas are not certain but are believed to be off south-eastern China. Recent genetic and photographic identification studies indicate that the western and eastern populations of Gray Whales share a summer feeding ground in the western Bering Sea along the Kamchatka coast, and that some western Gray Whales migrate eastward across the Bering Sea and North Pacific in fall to join the southward migration of eastern Gray Whales and overwinter in the coastal breeding lagoons of Baja California. It is not known to what extent, if any, these two populations interbreed, and this is an active area of research. Hunting throughout their distribution reduced numbers of Gray Whales to critically low levels by the 1930s, and it received international protection from commercial whaling under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Two US statutes, the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act, provide protection within US waters. In 1994, the US Department of the Interior removed the eastern North Pacific population from the Endangered Species Act’s List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. In 1972, Mexico protected Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammon’s Lagoon), and in 1979, Laguna San Ignacio became a Whale Refuge and Maritime Attraction Zone. In 1980, Mexico extended reserve status to Laguna Manuela and Laguna Guerrero Negro. All of these lagoons lie within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, created in 1988. In 1993, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization designated Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio lagoons as World Heritage Sites, and they are also Ramsar-protected wetlands under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. In 2002, all Mexican territorial seas and Economic Exclusion Zones were declared a refuge to protect large whales. Gray Whales also receive varying degrees of protection in territorial waters of Canada, Russia, Japan, Korea, and China. Threats that persist throughout the distribution of the Gray Whale include entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, habitat loss from oil and gas exploration, and general disturbance from coastal development.","Alter et al.

Support for this hypothesis occurred in May 2010, when a single Gray Whale was observed off the Mediterranean coasts of Israel and Spain, and again in May 2013 when another single Gray Whale was sighted off the Namibia coast. Apparently they had migrated from the North Pacific into the Arctic Ocean, followed the northern Eurasian coast, continued along the European coast and on to the Mediterranean and the Namibia coast. Appearance of Gray Whales in the Atlantic demonstrates that such exchanges between oceans are possible during periods of interglacial minimum ice conditions. Shrinking of Arctic sea ice due to climate change suggests that Gray Whales could recolonize the North Atlantic as ice and temperature barriers to mixing between the northern North Atlantic and the North Pacific biomes are reduced. Gray Whales are not known to be social, but they do form loose aggregations on feeding grounds and during migrations. There is no evidence of social bonding other than during copulation and between mother—offspring pairs. Gray Whales disperse widely across their principal feeding areas in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Arctic Ocean to forage for prey. Breeding males do not defend territories, show aggression toward conspecifics, or defend female “harems.” Male Gray Whales provide no parental care or assistance with rearing young. Females remain solitary when their offspring are young. They form aggregations within breeding lagoons when young are 2—4 months old. In these groups, a mother—offspring pair will cavort with other mother—offspring pairs, mixing and milling among them, perhaps socializing with each other. Females with young migrate alone rather than in groups, perhaps to minimize detection by predators. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population in the western North Pacific Ocean is classified as Critically Endangered. The eastern population of the Gray Whale ranges from the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea feeding grounds south along the western coast of North America to their winter aggregation and breeding areas along the Pacific coast of Baja California, the Gulf of California, and parts of the mainland coast of Mexico, numbering ¢.21,000 individuals in 2009. The western population is only ¢.120-130 individuals and feeds along the northern shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, off Sakhalin Island, and the eastern coast of Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia; their breeding areas are not certain but are believed to be off south-eastern China. Recent genetic and photographic identification studies indicate that the western and eastern populations of Gray Whales share a summer feeding ground in the western Bering Sea along the Kamchatka coast, and that some western Gray Whales migrate eastward across the Bering Sea and North Pacific in fall to join the southward migration of eastern Gray Whales and overwinter in the coastal breeding lagoons of Baja California. It is not known to what extent, if any, these two populations interbreed, and this is an active area of research. Hunting throughout their distribution reduced numbers of Gray Whales to critically low levels by the 1930s, and it received international protection from commercial whaling under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Two US statutes, the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act, provide protection within US waters. In 1994, the US Department of the Interior removed the eastern North Pacific population from the Endangered Species Act’s List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. In 1972, Mexico protected Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammon’s Lagoon), and in 1979, Laguna San Ignacio became a Whale Refuge and Maritime Attraction Zone. In 1980, Mexico extended reserve status to Laguna Manuela and Laguna Guerrero Negro. All of these lagoons lie within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, created in 1988. In 1993, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization designated Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio lagoons as World Heritage Sites, and they are also Ramsar-protected wetlands under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. In 2002, all Mexican territorial seas and Economic Exclusion Zones were declared a refuge to protect large whales. Gray Whales also receive varying degrees of protection in territorial waters of Canada, Russia, Japan, Korea, and China. Threats that persist throughout the distribution of the Gray Whale include entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, habitat loss from oil and gas exploration, and general disturbance from coastal development.

Length and weight at birth are estimated at ¢.120 cm and c¢.53 kg, respectively. Activity patterns. There is no specific information for this species, but a rehabilitated juvenile Pygmy Sperm Whale that was tracked made repeated night time dives that averaged more than eight minutes. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Pygmy Sperm Whale is assumed to be largely solitary. Atsea group size is 1-6 individuals, and a mean group size of 1-2 individuals has been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico. Maximum number of individuals stranding simultaneously is three (one male and two females). Off South Africa, Pygmy Sperm Whales seem to strand more frequently in July-October (winter-spring). Strandings occur more often in October-March (autumn-winter) on coasts in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, and they peak in August-September (late summer—autumn) in the south-eastern USA. Strandings along coasts of the eastern USA may be associated with inshore and offshore movements of the Gulf Stream, with Pygmy Sperm Whales coming ashore when warm waters are farthest offshore. Elsewhere, strandings do not suggest seasonal changes in distribution of the Pygmy Sperm Whale, or that it is migratory. Nothing is known about social organization of the Pygmy Sperm Whale. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The [IUCN Red List. Nevertheless, the real conservation status of the Pygmy Sperm Whale is uncertain and may range from Least Concern to a more threatened category. There are no estimates of global abundance, although frequent strandings in some areas suggest the Pygmy Sperm Whale may not be as uncommon as sightings suggest. Population estimates from specific regions in 2003-2006 should be considered provisional, but they suggested 247 Pygmy Sperm Whales off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington (USA) and 7251 off Hawaii; collectively, there may be only 395 Pygmy Sperm Whales and Dwarf Sperm Whales in the western North Atlantic Ocean and 742 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Current information is insufficient to evaluate population trends. Bibliography. Baird et al.

Male Narwhals are heavier and larger than females. The Narwhal has a blunt head and stout body that ends in a tapering tailstock with anchor-shaped tail flukes. At birth, young Narwhal’s skin is uneven gray or blue-gray, but it becomes dark gray in its first month. With age, Narwhals become progressively whiter. Ventral side and flanks become white with black or dark gray mottling; dorsal side remains black or dark brown, but it acquires flecks of white. Adult Narwhals remain black on head and dorsal ridge, and along edge of flippers and tail flukes. Males become much whiter with age than females. Although there are other interpretations, it is often reported that the name Narwhal is derived from “naar,” which meant “corpse” in Old Norse, and “hval,” which means “whale,” referring to the cadaver-like mottled skin of the whale. Most male Narwhals have a single long tooth, or tusk, that protrudes forward from the left side of the upper Jaw, or rostrum. This tusk can grow to 300 cm in old males and is very straight, with a tapered, spiraled ivory shaft ending in a smooth tip. Rarely, males can have twotusks, one on each side of the rostrum. A few females also have a single short, slender tusk. Unless one can see their genital slits, these tusked females can be mistaken for juvenile males, so the frequency of occurrence offemale tusks is not known. Most females are otherwise toothless.","Bays, fjords, and island passages in summer, preferring areas with depths of 500 m or more, and deep ice-covered seas in winter. There is some tracking evidence that individual Narwhals have interannual site fidelity for their summering areas. In the winter months, Narwhals frequently dive to depths in excess of 1000 m (maximum 1800 m) to forage near the bottom in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait.","Narwhals do not appearto feed extensively during summer, but they do take small Arctic gadids ( Boreogadus saida and Arctogadus glacialis ), Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides , Pleuronectidae ), and redfish ( Sebastes norvegicus, Sebastidae ). Gonatid squid beaks (presumably Gonatus fabricii) are found in stomachs of Narwhals in summer, but it is probable that squid are eaten earlier in spring or winter because hard chitinous parts can remain in the stomach a long time. Their main prey in winter is Greenland halibut. In fact, it has been estimated that a large portion of their annual energy requirement is derived from foraging on Greenland halibut.","Female Narwhals are sexually mature at 6-7 years of age, with an average size of 400 cm and 1000 kg. Males mature at about nine years old with an average size of 450 cm and 1600 kg. Narwhals mate in April-May. Gestation is 13-16 months, and a single offspring is born in June-August. Neonates are ¢.160 cm at birth. Young are suckled for a year or two, and they may remain with their mothers beyond lactation. Female Narwhals are believed to give birth every three years on average, like Belugas ( Delphinapterus leucas ). Age estimation has proven to be difficult, but one female was recorded to have reached 115 years.","Narwhals are shy and difficult to observe in the wild. Field observations from cliffs have shown that they socialize in certain bays or fjords. Males occasionally raise their tusks in the air and cross them as if gently sparring, or rest the tusk on the back ofanother. These are non-aggressive interactions, but there is evidence that the tusk may be used aggressively at other times of the year, presumably during the winter mating season, as evidenced by the number of broken tusks and scars on the melon in older males. It is hypothesized that male Narwhals use their tusks to display their dominance. This is probably done without aggression in most instances, but in cases where there is a challenger, it may be followed by an aggressive encounter. Tracking and recording dives of Narwhals with satellite-linked time-depth recorders have shown that they are frequently on the move and dive to great depths when foraging. Observations from shore and using cameras attached to the body of Narwhals suggest that they turn upside down soon after diving and remain that way through a good portion of their dive. This behavior may be particularly useful when foraging for bottom prey because it orients the melon, an appendage used in echolocation, downward. Narwhals are deep divers, with large adults capable of reaching depths well beyond 1000 m. Their dives in summer are shallower than their winter dives because they tend to occupy coastal areas with bottoms of only a few hundred meters in summer. Their winter habitat is along sea slopes, and they frequently dive to depths greater than 500 m, even down to ¢.1800 m.","Narwhals are migratory, occupying ice-covered seas in winter and moving to coastal waters in summer. Their migrations can cover 1000-2000 km between summering and wintering areas and last 2-3 months. Narwhal populations have summer home ranges of probably 10,000-180,000 km* that vary depending on population size. Winter home ranges are 30,000-250,000 km*. Presumably, they are larger in winter because Narwhals must find openings in heavy ice cover. In effect, their surface home range is limited to ice openings and varies with formation and closure of ice cracks and leads. Narwhals are gregarious and most often seen in pods of 2-5 individuals. These pods are often segregated by sex or age and composed of either males or females and their offspring. Mixed-sex pods of up to 25 Narwhals are occasionally seen. At times, Narwhal pods merge into large mixed herds, numbering several hundred or even a thousand or more individuals. Such aggregations are most often seen in spring or fall during migrations, but they also are seen occasionally in summer, particularly when Narwhals are fleeing an area where Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) are hunting. In such instances, Narwhals hug the coastline and will go readily into shallow water to avoid predation. In winter, because Narwhals aggregate at cracks or leads in heavy pack ice that covers their deep-water habitat and these cracks and leads are few and far between, large numbers of Narwhals may be seen surfacing in these openings. Narwhals are quite vocal. They emit a variety of whistles and pulsed calls. There have been no captive communication studies of Narwhals where calls could be clearly assigned to individuals and behaviors, as there have been with Belugas. Preliminary field studies of Narwhals suggest that there are differences in whistles used in broad behavioral categories. Nevertheless, comparisons of behaviors observed while different pulsed calls could be heard did not suggest clear distinctions. These studies also showed that calls recorded from one herd were more similar to each other than calls recorded from other herds, suggesting that Narwhals emit groupor individual-specific calls with some sort of “accent” or “dialect.” Recordings from instruments attached directly to a few Narwhals led other researchers to hypothesize that Narwhals may indeed have individual call signatures. Groupor individual-specific calls have also been described for other odontocetes such as Killer Whales or Sperm Whales (Physeter catodon ). These calls may serve a role in maintaining group cohesion by allowing distant recognition of pod family members.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Narwhals have a circumpolar distribution and a total population probably over 80,000 individuals, with highest numbers in the Canadian eastern Arctic and West Greenland waters. They occur in low numbers in the western European Arctic Ocean. Narwhal numbers are highest north of the Arctic Circle. Potential threats to Narwhal populations are hunting, fisheries competition and bycatch, disturbance by vessel traffic, and climate-induced ecosystem changes in their seasonal habitats, such as increased competition with other marine species and increased predatory pressure from Killer Whales. The Narwhal is not presently considered threatened, but because there are uncertainties about numbers and population trends throughout their distribution and because they are intensively hunted in Canada and Greenland, they could become threatened if conservation measures are insufficient. Genetic data on Narwhals is not very detailed, but information to date suggests that their mtDNA is less diversified and the number of conservation and management units may not be as high as it is for Belugas. Nevertheless, studies of their seasonal distribution suggest that the number of management units should probably be larger than suggested by genetic data. At least eight management units are being proposed for Narwhals in Canadian and Greenlandic waters based on distinct summering areas.","Asselin & Richard (2011) | Bada et al. (1983) | Born et al.

Descriptive notes. Total length 370-500 cm; weight 700-1800 kg. Male Narwhals are heavier and larger than females. The Narwhal has a blunt head and stout body that ends in a tapering tailstock with anchor-shaped tail flukes. At birth, young Narwhal’s skin is uneven gray or blue-gray, but it becomes dark gray in its first month. With age, Narwhals become progressively whiter. Ventral side and flanks become white with black or dark gray mottling; dorsal side remains black or dark brown, but it acquires flecks of white. Adult Narwhals remain black on head and dorsal ridge, and along edge of flippers and tail flukes. Males become much whiter with age than females. Although there are other interpretations, it is often reported that the name Narwhal is derived from “naar,” which meant “corpse” in Old Norse, and “hval,” which means “whale,” referring to the cadaver-like mottled skin of the whale. Most male Narwhals have a single long tooth, or tusk, that protrudes forward from the left side of the upper Jaw, or rostrum. This tusk can grow to 300 cm in old males and is very straight, with a tapered, spiraled ivory shaft ending in a smooth tip. Rarely, males can have twotusks, one on each side of the rostrum. A few females also have a single short, slender tusk. Unless one can see their genital slits, these tusked females can be mistaken for juvenile males, so the frequency of occurrence offemale tusks is not known. Most females are otherwise toothless. Habitat. Bays, fjords, and island passages in summer, preferring areas with depths of 500 m or more, and deep ice-covered seas in winter. There is some tracking evidence that individual Narwhals have interannual site fidelity for their summering areas. In the winter months, Narwhals frequently dive to depths in excess of 1000 m (maximum 1800 m) to forage near the bottom in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. Food and Feeding. Narwhals do not appearto feed extensively during summer, but they do take small Arctic gadids ( Boreogadus saida and Arctogadus glacialis ), Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides , Pleuronectidae ), and redfish ( Sebastes norvegicus, Sebastidae ). Gonatid squid beaks (presumably Gonatus fabricii) are found in stomachs of Narwhals in summer, but it is probable that squid are eaten earlier in spring or winter because hard chitinous parts can remain in the stomach a long time. Their main prey in winter is Greenland halibut. In fact, it has been estimated that a large portion of their annual energy requirement is derived from foraging on Greenland halibut. Breeding. Female Narwhals are sexually mature at 6-7 years of age, with an average size of 400 cm and 1000 kg. Males mature at about nine years old with an average size of 450 cm and 1600 kg. Narwhals mate in April-May. Gestation is 13-16 months, and a single offspring is born in June-August. Neonates are ¢.160 cm at birth. Young are suckled for a year or two, and they may remain with their mothers beyond lactation. Female Narwhals are believed to give birth every three years on average, like Belugas ( Delphinapterus leucas ). Age estimation has proven to be difficult, but one female was recorded to have reached 115 years. Activity patterns. Narwhals are shy and difficult to observe in the wild. Field observations from cliffs have shown that they socialize in certain bays or fjords. Males occasionally raise their tusks in the air and cross them as if gently sparring, or rest the tusk on the back ofanother. These are non-aggressive interactions, but there is evidence that the tusk may be used aggressively at other times of the year, presumably during the winter mating season, as evidenced by the number of broken tusks and scars on the melon in older males. It is hypothesized that male Narwhals use their tusks to display their dominance. This is probably done without aggression in most instances, but in cases where there is a challenger, it may be followed by an aggressive encounter. Tracking and recording dives of Narwhals with satellite-linked time-depth recorders have shown that they are frequently on the move and dive to great depths when foraging. Observations from shore and using cameras attached to the body of Narwhals suggest that they turn upside down soon after diving and remain that way through a good portion of their dive. This behavior may be particularly useful when foraging for bottom prey because it orients the melon, an appendage used in echolocation, downward. Narwhals are deep divers, with large adults capable of reaching depths well beyond 1000 m. Their dives in summer are shallower than their winter dives because they tend to occupy coastal areas with bottoms of only a few hundred meters in summer. Their winter habitat is along sea slopes, and they frequently dive to depths greater than 500 m, even down to ¢.1800 m. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Narwhals are migratory, occupying ice-covered seas in winter and moving to coastal waters in summer. Their migrations can cover 1000-2000 km between summering and wintering areas and last 2-3 months. Narwhal populations have summer home ranges of probably 10,000-180,000 km* that vary depending on population size. Winter home ranges are 30,000-250,000 km*. Presumably, they are larger in winter because Narwhals must find openings in heavy ice cover. In effect, their surface home range is limited to ice openings and varies with formation and closure of ice cracks and leads. Narwhals are gregarious and most often seen in pods of 2-5 individuals. These pods are often segregated by sex or age and composed of either males or females and their offspring. Mixed-sex pods of up to 25 Narwhals are occasionally seen. At times, Narwhal pods merge into large mixed herds, numbering several hundred or even a thousand or more individuals. Such aggregations are most often seen in spring or fall during migrations, but they also are seen occasionally in summer, particularly when Narwhals are fleeing an area where Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) are hunting. In such instances, Narwhals hug the coastline and will go readily into shallow water to avoid predation. In winter, because Narwhals aggregate at cracks or leads in heavy pack ice that covers their deep-water habitat and these cracks and leads are few and far between, large numbers of Narwhals may be seen surfacing in these openings. Narwhals are quite vocal. They emit a variety of whistles and pulsed calls. There have been no captive communication studies of Narwhals where calls could be clearly assigned to individuals and behaviors, as there have been with Belugas. Preliminary field studies of Narwhals suggest that there are differences in whistles used in broad behavioral categories. Nevertheless, comparisons of behaviors observed while different pulsed calls could be heard did not suggest clear distinctions. These studies also showed that calls recorded from one herd were more similar to each other than calls recorded from other herds, suggesting that Narwhals emit groupor individual-specific calls with some sort of “accent” or “dialect.” Recordings from instruments attached directly to a few Narwhals led other researchers to hypothesize that Narwhals may indeed have individual call signatures. Groupor individual-specific calls have also been described for other odontocetes such as Killer Whales or Sperm Whales (Physeter catodon ). These calls may serve a role in maintaining group cohesion by allowing distant recognition of pod family members. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Narwhals have a circumpolar distribution and a total population probably over 80,000 individuals, with highest numbers in the Canadian eastern Arctic and West Greenland waters. They occur in low numbers in the western European Arctic Ocean. Narwhal numbers are highest north of the Arctic Circle. Potential threats to Narwhal populations are hunting, fisheries competition and bycatch, disturbance by vessel traffic, and climate-induced ecosystem changes in their seasonal habitats, such as increased competition with other marine species and increased predatory pressure from Killer Whales. The Narwhal is not presently considered threatened, but because there are uncertainties about numbers and population trends throughout their distribution and because they are intensively hunted in Canada and Greenland, they could become threatened if conservation measures are insufficient. Genetic data on Narwhals is not very detailed, but information to date suggests that their mtDNA is less diversified and the number of conservation and management units may not be as high as it is for Belugas. Nevertheless, studies of their seasonal distribution suggest that the number of management units should probably be larger than suggested by genetic data. At least eight management units are being proposed for Narwhals in Canadian and Greenlandic waters based on distinct summering areas. Bibliography. Asselin & Richard (2011), Bada et al.

This species is monotypic.","Arctic and subarctic waters S to ¢.50° N, Greenlandic and E European populations have their S distributional limits farther to the N at c.64° N. Young Belugas occasionally stray S of their normal distribution, and they have been seen near Long Island, New York, USA, and in the Seine River, France.","Total length 300-450 cm; weight 500-1600 kg. Male Belugas are heavier and larger than females. Size varies geographically, with larger individuals in Arctic regions than in subarctic regions. Belugas are rotund, with bulging midsections when fat. They have visible neck regions, which in healthy adults and particularly males give the appearance of shoulders. Unlike most other whales, cervical vertebrae of Belugas are not fused, and they can move their head quite well, probably an adaptation to life in shallow waters and under jumbled sea ice. They have small blunt heads with short beaks, and their mouths curve upward toward the eyes. Belugas have 8-11 blunt, uniform-looking teeth on both sides of upper and lower jaws, up to 40 in total. Their rostrums have globe-like melons, lumps offatty tissue that are used as acoustic lens to focus echolocation signals. Blowhole opens behind the melon just above the eyes. Dorsal ridge runs along mid-back, starting well behind head and flattening before tailstock. Belugas are born pink, white, or gray and become slate-gray in their first month. They progressively whiten over the entire body with age. Adult Belugas are entirely white, except for edges of fins, tail flukes, and dorsal ridges, which retain some dark pigment. In spring and early summer, Belugas may appear yellow when they are shedding epidermal skin during annual molt. This is most apparent in the Hudson Bay region where skin molt is rapid. Such a rapid molt has not been observed for Belugas elsewhere and may simply be more gradual in other parts of their distribution.","Coastal areas in summer and offshore water in open pack ice or heavier ice cover, with expanses of seawater that remain open, in winter. Thousands of Belugas may be seen in or around certain estuaries in June-September. They occupy these estuarine waters for periods that vary from a few weeks to three months, depending on latitude. Subarctic Belugas tend to remain in estuaries longer than their more northern counterparts. Belugas can form aggregations of several thousand individuals in a single estuary. In estuaries with high tidal amplitude, such as Churchill or Seal River estuaries of Canada, they move upstream to the shallowest parts of the estuary or even into the river outflow with rising tides and recede downstream with lowering tides. Females and their offspring are generally found farther upstream of the estuary or river outflow than males. In some cases, Belugas may become stranded in a tidal pool when they linger too long on an ebbing tide. Movement in and out of estuaries is not uncommon, and Belugas may use more than one estuary during summer. Function of coastal aggregations of Belugas has been the subject of much debate. It has been suggested that they use estuaries to benefit from warm water, which would promote growth of newborns during early lactation. Shallow estuaries would also serve as havens against the main predator of Belugas, the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca), when young Belugas are most susceptible to predation. Summer aggregation in estuaries also coincides with skin molt, and it has been suggested that warm and fresh water promotes rapid skin molt. Finally, in some estuaries, Belugas may find an abundance of prey fish, like capelin (Mallotus villosus), eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), whitefish (Coregonus sp.), or various salmon species. It is plausible that estuaries serve more than one function, and variation occurs across regions. It is noteworthy that in some regions, like Svalbard, Belugas do not occupy estuaries in summer and do not show signs of rapid molt. The need for warm water by newborn Belugas was questioned when it was shown that they have sufficient insulation at birth to withstand cold Arctic waters. It is also notable that some shallow bays used in summer or fall by Beluga herds (e.g. Millut Bay, Baffin Island, and Bethune Inlet, Devon Island) have glacial-fed river mouths and consequently their waters are colder than surrounding seawater. Some subarctic populations of Belugas (e.g. Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Cumberland Sound, Cook Inlet, and Anadyr Bay) are sedentary, remaining in or near their summer range in winter. Belugas in more northern regions spend a shorter time in estuaries than their more southern counterparts, usually confining their mass occupation to the early part of the season. These Belugas have been tracked to areas with depths of several hundred meters, where they were diving to the bottom. The difference in duration of estuarine occupation could be due to the fact that northern Belugasstill find shelter from Killer Whales in residual pack ice in summer, while in subarctic waters, where pack ice disappears earlier, Belugas can only find shelter in estuaries and shallow bays. In winter, Belugas avoid coastal fast ice and seek offshore waters, generally over banks less than 500 m deep. Their wintering areas are covered with open pack ice or, in heavier ice cover, with leads or “polynyas” (expanses of seawater that remain open in winter due to the effect of currents and winds). In these areas, Belugas frequently dive all the way to the seabed, presumably to feed.","Belugas eat a variety of pelagic and benthic fish and invertebrates. Small Arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida and Arctogadus glacialis, both Gadidae ) and Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Pleuronectidae ) are eaten throughout the year. Gonatid squid (Gonatus fabricii) probably are eaten mostly in winter. They also prey on fish species found in estuaries or adjacent coastal waters, such as osmerids capelin and eulachon, and salmonids, salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), charr (Salvelinus sp.), and whitefish. During autumn migration, Belugas have been seen taking advantage of large swarms of Arctic cod and shrimps (e.g. Pandalus montagui). In winter, they are known to eat redfish ( Sebastes marinus, Sebastidae ), other shrimp species (e.g. northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis , Pandalidae ), and squid. Belugas actively feed in springtime, diving under edges of the fast ice, presumably foraging for Arctic cod and possibly for coregonid fish in some areas.","Belugas mate in late winter or early spring, either in their winter home ranges or during migration to their summer home ranges. Females reach sexual maturity at 9-12 years, males later. Gestation is c.14 months. A single offspring is born in spring to late summer, with peaks in late June-August. Neonates are c.150 cm in length and 35-85 kg in weight at birth. Young are suckled for six months to two years, and they may remain with their mothers for several years after that. Gestation of over a year followed by a prolonged suckling period precludes having an offspring every year. A biennial birth rate is more likely for young female Belugas; with age, females tend to give birth less frequently. Overall, Beluga populations probably have an average birth rate of one young every three years, but this may vary slightly among populations. Maximum recorded age is ¢.80 years.","While in estuaries, Belugas have been observed rubbing on the bottom and surfacing with mud on their heads. This behavior is thought to accelerate sloughing of molting skin in early summer. In estuaries, they are often seen spy-hopping, tail-slapping, and chasing and rubbing against each other. During these social activities, many vocalizations can be heard. Rosette formations have also been described where several Belugas quietly face each other with their bodies radiating out. Most dives in coastal areas are shallow but, when offshore, Belugas of both sexes frequently dive through the water column down to the seabed to depths of at least 500 m; some dives even go down to 800 m. Young are unable to make these deep dives and remain near the surface while their mothers forage. Adult male Belugas are capable of deeper dives; a record dive of ¢.1000 m has been measured. Both sexes make dives that last 10-25 minutes. Winter dives are longer, on average, than summer dives because of deeper seabeds in their wintering areas.","Many populations of Belugas are migratory. They alternate between large ice-covered seas in winter and summer ranges that center closer to coastal areas. Their migrations can cover 1500-4000 km between summering and wintering areas and last 2-3 months. Genetic and tracking studies document considerable diversity of mtDNA types (haplotypes), and comparisons of haplotypes suggest that Beluga populations have a strong fidelity to the areas where they summer. Chromosomal or nDNA is inherited from both parents and shows less diversity than mtDNA. This suggests that there is interbreeding between neighboring summer stocks of Belugas, presumably due to overlapping wintering ranges. Beluga populations in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, James Bay, and Cumberland Sound of Canada, Cook Inlet of Alaska, and Anadyr Bay and White Sea of Russia are non-migratory. They reside in and near large estuaries, bays, or enclosed seas throughout the year. Their summer ranges are further inshore than their winter ranges, but their seasonal ranges overlap. Belugas are presumably responding to changing ice conditions and prey availability by extending their distributions in winter. Both summer and winter home range sizes of Belugas vary with population size. Generally, small (less than 10,000 individuals), sedentary subarctic populations of Belugas have small home ranges of a few thousand to a few tens of thousand square kilometers, and larger populations (greater than 10,000 individuals), all of which are migratory, have summer and winter home ranges of 50,000-120,000 km*. Winter ranges are broader than summer ranges, presumably because Belugas occupy ice-covered waters and have to spread out more widely to find open water. Belugas often form pods of 2-10 individuals, usually segregated by sex and age: pods of females and offspring, pods of juveniles, or pods of adult males. Single individuals are usually adult males. In summer, Belugas form large mixed aggregations of several hundred to several thousand individuals in estuaries and shallow coastal bays. The largest estuarine herd on record numbered more than 7000 Belugas in Hudson Bay’s Seal River Estuary. Females and offspring are usually found farther upstream of estuaries than males, which tend to be more peripheral. Large herds are also seen in autumn and spring during migrations to and from wintering areas.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List, but Cook Inlet subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. Belugas have a circumpolar distribution, with highest numbers in Canadian Arctic and Alaskan waters. A number of potential threats have been suggested for Belugas. The major concern relates to intensive hunting of small or declining populations, particularly in Canada and Greenland. Less easily quantifiable concerns are fisheries competition and bycatch, habitat loss or disturbance due to industrial activity and increased vessel traffic, environmental contaminants, and climate-induced ecosystem changes in their seasonal habitats, such as increased competition with other marine species and increased predatory pressure from Killer Whales. Numbers of Belugas worldwide are high, in excess of 150,000 individuals in total, and it is not considered threatened. Genetic information and data on the seasonal distribution of Beluga populations serve as the basis for population conservation and management around the world. There are at least 16 management units in Arctic and subarctic regions, and probably more than one-half of the units represent reproductively isolated populations. Declines of some Canadian Beluga populations (Saint Lawrence Estuary, Cumberland Sound, Eastern Hudson Bay, and Ungava Bay) have been documented, and there are proposed or enacted listings of threatened or endangered status under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in Canada. Listing under SARA requires responsible government departments to design and implement a recovery plan to reverse the risk factors affecting the population, including protecting critical habitat. In the USA, the Alaskan Cook Inlet population of Belugas is also listed under the US Endangered Species Act, a listing that has similar requirements for recovery planning and implementation. In Greenland, the observed decline of the Beluga population that winters in Davis Strait has resulted in the establishment of new regulations on hunting of West Greenland Belugas. Populations of Belugas elsewhere in the world appear to be stable, although many Beluga populations near Russia have not been assessed. Small numbers of Belugas in the Okhotsk Sea are live-captured annually for the aquarium trade. The export of those captures from Russia 1s regulated under CITES.","Alvarez-Flores & Heide-Jorgensen (2004) | Angliss & Outlaw (2005) | Bailey & Zinger (1995) | Barber & Richard (1992) | Barber et al.

Beluga Delphinapterus leucas French: Béluga / German: \WeilRwal / Spanish: Beluga Other common names: Beluga Whale , Sea Canary , White Whale Taxonomy. Delphinus leucas Pallas, 1776 , “die im Obischen Meerbusen” (= mouth of Ob River), North-eastern Siberia, Russia. This species is monotypic. Distribution. Arctic and subarctic waters S to ¢.50° N, Greenlandic and E European populations have their S distributional limits farther to the N at c.64° N. Young Belugas occasionally stray S of their normal distribution, and they have been seen near Long Island, New York, USA, and in the Seine River, France. Descriptive notes. Total length 300-450 cm; weight 500-1600 kg. Male Belugas are heavier and larger than females. Size varies geographically, with larger individuals in Arctic regions than in subarctic regions. Belugas are rotund, with bulging midsections when fat. They have visible neck regions, which in healthy adults and particularly males give the appearance of shoulders. Unlike most other whales, cervical vertebrae of Belugas are not fused, and they can move their head quite well, probably an adaptation to life in shallow waters and under jumbled sea ice. They have small blunt heads with short beaks, and their mouths curve upward toward the eyes. Belugas have 8-11 blunt, uniform-looking teeth on both sides of upper and lower jaws, up to 40 in total. Their rostrums have globe-like melons, lumps offatty tissue that are used as acoustic lens to focus echolocation signals. Blowhole opens behind the melon just above the eyes. Dorsal ridge runs along mid-back, starting well behind head and flattening before tailstock. Belugas are born pink, white, or gray and become slate-gray in their first month. They progressively whiten over the entire body with age. Adult Belugas are entirely white, except for edges of fins, tail flukes, and dorsal ridges, which retain some dark pigment. In spring and early summer, Belugas may appear yellow when they are shedding epidermal skin during annual molt. This is most apparent in the Hudson Bay region where skin molt is rapid. Such a rapid molt has not been observed for Belugas elsewhere and may simply be more gradual in other parts of their distribution. Habitat. Coastal areas in summer and offshore water in open pack ice or heavier ice cover, with expanses of seawater that remain open, in winter. Thousands of Belugas may be seen in or around certain estuaries in June-September. They occupy these estuarine waters for periods that vary from a few weeks to three months, depending on latitude. Subarctic Belugas tend to remain in estuaries longer than their more northern counterparts. Belugas can form aggregations of several thousand individuals in a single estuary. In estuaries with high tidal amplitude, such as Churchill or Seal River estuaries of Canada, they move upstream to the shallowest parts of the estuary or even into the river outflow with rising tides and recede downstream with lowering tides. Females and their offspring are generally found farther upstream of the estuary or river outflow than males. In some cases, Belugas may become stranded in a tidal pool when they linger too long on an ebbing tide. Movement in and out of estuaries is not uncommon, and Belugas may use more than one estuary during summer. Function of coastal aggregations of Belugas has been the subject of much debate. It has been suggested that they use estuaries to benefit from warm water, which would promote growth of newborns during early lactation. Shallow estuaries would also serve as havens against the main predator of Belugas, the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca), when young Belugas are most susceptible to predation. Summer aggregation in estuaries also coincides with skin molt, and it has been suggested that warm and fresh water promotes rapid skin molt. Finally, in some estuaries, Belugas may find an abundance of prey fish, like capelin (Mallotus villosus), eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), whitefish (Coregonus sp.), or various salmon species. It is plausible that estuaries serve more than one function, and variation occurs across regions. It is noteworthy that in some regions, like Svalbard, Belugas do not occupy estuaries in summer and do not show signs of rapid molt. The need for warm water by newborn Belugas was questioned when it was shown that they have sufficient insulation at birth to withstand cold Arctic waters. It is also notable that some shallow bays used in summer or fall by Beluga herds (e.g. Millut Bay, Baffin Island, and Bethune Inlet, Devon Island) have glacial-fed river mouths and consequently their waters are colder than surrounding seawater. Some subarctic populations of Belugas (e.g. Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Cumberland Sound, Cook Inlet, and Anadyr Bay) are sedentary, remaining in or near their summer range in winter. Belugas in more northern regions spend a shorter time in estuaries than their more southern counterparts, usually confining their mass occupation to the early part of the season. These Belugas have been tracked to areas with depths of several hundred meters, where they were diving to the bottom. The difference in duration of estuarine occupation could be due to the fact that northern Belugasstill find shelter from Killer Whales in residual pack ice in summer, while in subarctic waters, where pack ice disappears earlier, Belugas can only find shelter in estuaries and shallow bays. In winter, Belugas avoid coastal fast ice and seek offshore waters, generally over banks less than 500 m deep. Their wintering areas are covered with open pack ice or, in heavier ice cover, with leads or “polynyas” (expanses of seawater that remain open in winter due to the effect of currents and winds). In these areas, Belugas frequently dive all the way to the seabed, presumably to feed. Food and Feeding. Belugas eat a variety of pelagic and benthic fish and invertebrates. Small Arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida and Arctogadus glacialis, both Gadidae ) and Greenland halibut ( Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Pleuronectidae ) are eaten throughout the year. Gonatid squid (Gonatus fabricii) probably are eaten mostly in winter. They also prey on fish species found in estuaries or adjacent coastal waters, such as osmerids capelin and eulachon, and salmonids, salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), charr (Salvelinus sp.), and whitefish. During autumn migration, Belugas have been seen taking advantage of large swarms of Arctic cod and shrimps (e.g. Pandalus montagui). In winter, they are known to eat redfish ( Sebastes marinus, Sebastidae ), other shrimp species (e.g. northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis , Pandalidae ), and squid. Belugas actively feed in springtime, diving under edges of the fast ice, presumably foraging for Arctic cod and possibly for coregonid fish in some areas. Breeding. Belugas mate in late winter or early spring, either in their winter home ranges or during migration to their summer home ranges. Females reach sexual maturity at 9-12 years, males later. Gestation is c.14 months. A single offspring is born in spring to late summer, with peaks in late June-August. Neonates are c.150 cm in length and 35-85 kg in weight at birth. Young are suckled for six months to two years, and they may remain with their mothers for several years after that. Gestation of over a year followed by a prolonged suckling period precludes having an offspring every year. A biennial birth rate is more likely for young female Belugas; with age, females tend to give birth less frequently. Overall, Beluga populations probably have an average birth rate of one young every three years, but this may vary slightly among populations. Maximum recorded age is ¢.80 years. Activity patterns. While in estuaries, Belugas have been observed rubbing on the bottom and surfacing with mud on their heads. This behavior is thought to accelerate sloughing of molting skin in early summer. In estuaries, they are often seen spy-hopping, tail-slapping, and chasing and rubbing against each other. During these social activities, many vocalizations can be heard. Rosette formations have also been described where several Belugas quietly face each other with their bodies radiating out. Most dives in coastal areas are shallow but, when offshore, Belugas of both sexes frequently dive through the water column down to the seabed to depths of at least 500 m; some dives even go down to 800 m. Young are unable to make these deep dives and remain near the surface while their mothers forage. Adult male Belugas are capable of deeper dives; a record dive of ¢.1000 m has been measured. Both sexes make dives that last 10-25 minutes. Winter dives are longer, on average, than summer dives because of deeper seabeds in their wintering areas. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Many populations of Belugas are migratory. They alternate between large ice-covered seas in winter and summer ranges that center closer to coastal areas. Their migrations can cover 1500-4000 km between summering and wintering areas and last 2-3 months. Genetic and tracking studies document considerable diversity of mtDNA types (haplotypes), and comparisons of haplotypes suggest that Beluga populations have a strong fidelity to the areas where they summer. Chromosomal or nDNA is inherited from both parents and shows less diversity than mtDNA. This suggests that there is interbreeding between neighboring summer stocks of Belugas, presumably due to overlapping wintering ranges. Beluga populations in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, James Bay, and Cumberland Sound of Canada, Cook Inlet of Alaska, and Anadyr Bay and White Sea of Russia are non-migratory. They reside in and near large estuaries, bays, or enclosed seas throughout the year. Their summer ranges are further inshore than their winter ranges, but their seasonal ranges overlap. Belugas are presumably responding to changing ice conditions and prey availability by extending their distributions in winter. Both summer and winter home range sizes of Belugas vary with population size. Generally, small (less than 10,000 individuals), sedentary subarctic populations of Belugas have small home ranges of a few thousand to a few tens of thousand square kilometers, and larger populations (greater than 10,000 individuals), all of which are migratory, have summer and winter home ranges of 50,000-120,000 km*. Winter ranges are broader than summer ranges, presumably because Belugas occupy ice-covered waters and have to spread out more widely to find open water. Belugas often form pods of 2-10 individuals, usually segregated by sex and age: pods of females and offspring, pods of juveniles, or pods of adult males. Single individuals are usually adult males. In summer, Belugas form large mixed aggregations of several hundred to several thousand individuals in estuaries and shallow coastal bays. The largest estuarine herd on record numbered more than 7000 Belugas in Hudson Bay’s Seal River Estuary. Females and offspring are usually found farther upstream of estuaries than males, which tend to be more peripheral. Large herds are also seen in autumn and spring during migrations to and from wintering areas. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List, but Cook Inlet subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. Belugas have a circumpolar distribution, with highest numbers in Canadian Arctic and Alaskan waters. A number of potential threats have been suggested for Belugas. The major concern relates to intensive hunting of small or declining populations, particularly in Canada and Greenland. Less easily quantifiable concerns are fisheries competition and bycatch, habitat loss or disturbance due to industrial activity and increased vessel traffic, environmental contaminants, and climate-induced ecosystem changes in their seasonal habitats, such as increased competition with other marine species and increased predatory pressure from Killer Whales. Numbers of Belugas worldwide are high, in excess of 150,000 individuals in total, and it is not considered threatened. Genetic information and data on the seasonal distribution of Beluga populations serve as the basis for population conservation and management around the world. There are at least 16 management units in Arctic and subarctic regions, and probably more than one-half of the units represent reproductively isolated populations. Declines of some Canadian Beluga populations (Saint Lawrence Estuary, Cumberland Sound, Eastern Hudson Bay, and Ungava Bay) have been documented, and there are proposed or enacted listings of threatened or endangered status under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in Canada. Listing under SARA requires responsible government departments to design and implement a recovery plan to reverse the risk factors affecting the population, including protecting critical habitat. In the USA, the Alaskan Cook Inlet population of Belugas is also listed under the US Endangered Species Act, a listing that has similar requirements for recovery planning and implementation. In Greenland, the observed decline of the Beluga population that winters in Davis Strait has resulted in the establishment of new regulations on hunting of West Greenland Belugas. Populations of Belugas elsewhere in the world appear to be stable, although many Beluga populations near Russia have not been assessed. Small numbers of Belugas in the Okhotsk Sea are live-captured annually for the aquarium trade. The export of those captures from Russia 1s regulated under CITES. Bibliography.

W. Australia.” This species is monotypic.","Southern Hemisphere, circumpolar, generally between 30° S and 55° S but can occur north to 19° S if cold currents are present.","Total length 590- 650 cm; weight 2850-3863 kg. Female Pygmy Right Whales are slightly longer than males. In a sample of physically mature skeletons, females averaged 634 cm in length and males 610 cm. The smallest physically mature specimen (a male) was 590 cm. Weights of only five adult Pygmy Right Whales have been recorded. Flippers are 66-90 cm, dorsalfin is 21-35 cm, and flukes are 135-200 cm. Relative to body length, several external measurements increase in length as an individual grows from juvenile to adult: dorsal fin from ¢.3% to 5%, flippers from c.11% to 13%, and flukes from c.23% to 29%. Flukes have a distinct median notch that is 5-9 cm deep. Body of the adult Pygmy Right Whale is broad, giving it a bulky appearance. Flippers are small compared with other baleen whales and are slightly rounded at their tips. Relative to total body length of an adult Pygmy Right Whale, dorsal fin is situated ¢.65% of the way back from tip of rostrum. Newborns are c.200 cm in length at birth; the smallest stranded individual was 190 cm, and largest fetus had a 212cm body length. Pygmy Right Whales are medium to dark gray above and almost white below. There are several distinctive crescent-shaped, pale markings on and just behind the head. The one above the flipper is similar to the Antarctic Minke Whale ( Balaenoptera bonaerensis ), but the Pygmy Right Whale has a gray flare running forward of the eye. The most distinctive external features of the Pygmy Right Whale are absence of throat grooves, arched jaw (similar to but not as marked as in the true right whale family, Balaenidae ), very narrow rostrum when seen from above, and, if mouth is open, long baleen plates and a white or cream band of gum into which they are embedded. This latter feature is often observed at the water’s surface because there is a tendency for rostrum to be raised out of water at an angle. Two to eight mandibular hairs and several maxillary hairs are present on neonatal Pygmy Right Whales; mandibular hair follicles can persistent into adulthood. There are 213-265 baleen plates on each side of the upper jaw. Color and form of baleen plates are unique to the Pygmy Right Whale: they are long (longest plate 88 cm) and narrow, and white to cream with a darker external band of black, brown, or deep gray; baleen bristles are the same color as the inside of baleen plates and very fine in texture (0-1 mm diameter). They were described by Gray in 1870 as “the most beautiful, the most Flexible, most elastic, and the toughest whalebone or baleen yet discovered.” Baleen plates are short at birth (longest plate c.6 cm) and grow more rapidly after weaning at an estimated five months of age.","There have been few sightings oflive Pygmy Right Whales “at sea,” and much of the perceived knowledge of habitat use comes from localities of stranded and beachcast whales. Pygmy Right Whales have been seen in the open ocean, on continental shelves, and close to the coast of southern continents but not Antarctica. Enrichment by abundant meso-zooplankton (e.g. upwelling and convergences) is likely an important factor in determining where Pygmy Right Whales live. Distribution of the Pygmy Right Whale encompasses waters where sea surface temperatures are ¢.5-20°C.","Thereis limited information on the diet of the Pygmy Right Whale. Stomach contents ofsix individuals have been reported, and copepods and small euphausiids were abundant in some cases. Amphipods have also been recorded. Calanoid copepods included Centropages brachiatus and Calanoides carinatus in an individual from South Africa and Calanusfinmarchicus in individuals caught in the South Atlantic. Small euphausiids found in stomachs of a few stranded Pygmy Right Whales from New Zealand and Australia have not identified to species, but the small euphausiid Nyctiphanes australis is abundant in that region. The amphipod Themisto guadichaudii was present in small amounts in a stranded juvenile Pygmy Right Whale from South Africa. Knowledge ofthe life cycle of trematodes and cestodes found in intestines of Pygmy Right Whales may augment insight on what species they consume. Mode of feeding has not been confirmed, but very long baleen plates and lack of throat grooves suggests a similar mode to right whales and Bowhead Whales (i.e. skimming as opposed to gulping). Presence of a few bird feathers in stomachs of Pygmy Right Whales may indicate surface-feeding behavior. Several groups of Pygmy Right Whales have been observed feeding at or near the Subtropical Convergence south of Australia and New Zealand, and individuals have been seen feeding in coastal areas. Suspected feeding behavior was observed in a 3m juvenile that was studied during an extended stay in a large bay on the southern coast of Australia. The juvenile’s behavior included surface skimming and stirring up sediment in a sea grass bed; abundant plankton was reported in the bay at the same time. There is some evidence that Pygmy Right Whales feed in upwelled water on the continental shelf, over seamounts, and at the Subtropical Convergence in the region of Australia and New Zealand. Off Namibia, there appears to be an association with the cold, highly productive Benguela Current.","Birthing grounds have not been reported for the Pygmy Right Whale. Stranding records provide some evidence that births and nursing may be more common in the northern parts of its distribution, which are north of ¢.41° S in the region of Australia and New Zealand. A preponderance of stranded juveniles of about weaning length along the Namibian coast is evidence of a similar trend off Africa. Mating of Pygmy Right Whales has not been observed. A protracted birthing and mating period of about eight months has been suggested, possibly in April-October. Gestation length is not known, but limited indirect information suggests that it is likely 10-12 months. To date, there is no confirmed evidence of twinning although there is an unconfirmed report of two late-stage fetuses in a stranded female from Tasmania in 1960. Left and right ovaries are functional. Only seven fetuses and neonates have been sexed, giving a ratio of four males to seven females. Future studies of the reproductive organs of stranded individuals may reveal if a post-partum estrus occurs in the Pygmy Right Whale, as it does rarely in some other species of baleen whales. Like all cetaceans, female Pygmy Right Whales have twoteats located in smallslits, one on each side of the urogenital slit. Mammary glands of a female with a late-term fetus (212 cm in length) were 80-90 cm long and not producing milk. Testes of a mature male were c.0.9-1 kg. Although there are no age estimates for Pygmy Right Whales, age at weaning was calculated by plotting body lengths of stranded individuals for fetuses and pre-weaning juveniles against month of death. Estimated age at weaning was about five months, which is consistent with some other species of baleen whales. Body length at weaning is probably 300-350 cm. Too few specimens have been studied to accurately determine length at sexual maturity, but it is likely 450-550 cm in both sexes. Additional evidence to support this hypothesis is that all individual Pygmy Right Whales studied to date, greater than or equal to 590 cm in body length, were physically mature and sexual maturity precedes physical maturity in most mammals.","There have been very few observations of live Pygmy Right Whales, the longest duration of which was a 3m juvenile that remained in Portland Harbour, Victoria, Australia, for just over two months. During much ofits stay in the harbor, it surfaced to breathe at intervals of c.1-5 minutes. Some resting behavior was observed during the day, but swimming and long and short dives were noted for much of the day. Suspected feeding behavior was observed on the bottom of the shallow bay during the day and at the surface at dusk. During brief encounters, groups of Pygmy Right Whales have been seen swimming slowly just below the surface in morning daylight hours and, in one case, moving in a quite closely packed circle. Almost all observations of Pygmy Right Whales have been made during the day. Several sightings have noted dives of 3—4 minutes and swimming speeds of 3-8 knots (nautical miles/h), although it is not known if this is a maximum speed. Maximum and normal dive depths are not known. Flukes do not appear at the surface during the beginning of a dive, as is the pattern for some species of baleen whales.","There are no data on long-range movements of individual Pygmy Right Whales. Observations have been made of individuals in protected coastal waters where they traversed distances ofless than 5 km. A single Pygmy Right Whale was seen swimming up and down along the shore in shallow water for 4-5 weeks in summer. In keeping with other primarily pelagic cetaceans, the Pygmy Right Whale is unlikely to have a defined a home range. Presence of oval scars, often very numerous, attributed to the cookie-cutter shark (Zsistius spp.) on many Pygmy Right Whales suggests that they spend at least some time in warm waters of the tropics and warm temperate zone where these sharks live. This, and the fact that there is evidence for differential relative ages north and south of c.41° S off Australia and New Zealand, may indicate migration of Pygmy Right Whales. It has been suggested that movements are related to feeding in pelagic and continental shelf environments. All inshore observations of Pygmy Right Whales have been of 1-2 individuals, often mother—offspring pairs. There have also been several incidences of adult females stranded with juveniles of about weaning size. Offshore and oceanic sightings have involved groups of three to more than 100 individuals, nine of which were groups of less than 15 individuals. The Pygmy Right Whale has been observed with seabirds and other cetacean species, including the Sei Whale ( Balaenoptera borealis ), dolphins (possibly Lagenorhychus sp.), and “blackfish” (possibly pilot whales, Globicephala sp.). Almost nothing is known of communication among Pygmy Right Whales. Sounds produced by a c¢.3m individual in an inshore environment were recorded by hydrophone, and they were simpler than most other species of baleen whales. This juvenile made only one type of sound, a short, intense thump-like pulse or tone burst with a down sweep in frequency and decaying amplitude. This almost always occurred in pairs and was audible to human divers. Observations of a live-stranded juvenile in Namibia were similarly described, and the vibrations of the sound could be felt through soles of feet of humans nearby. Laryngeal apparatus of the Pygmy Right Whale is significantly different from other species of baleen whales in that the laryngeal sac is very large and offset to the right side of the thorax. This structure may allow large amounts of air to be recycled when producing sound during submergence.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Convention for Migratory Species Appendix II. Unlike most other species of baleen whales, the Pygmy Right Whale was never a target of whaling due to its small size and protection (along with right whales) under international agreement since 1935. Russian whalers took a few individuals for scientific study during the 1970s in the South Atlantic Ocean. There are also instances of Pygmy Right Whales being killed in inshore fishing nets and carcasses used for meat or scientific purposes. There are no estimates of abundance, and judging by the frequent strandings in Australia and New Zealand, there is no immediate concern for the future of the Pygmy Right Whale. If climate change alters patterns of plankton abundance and distribution, there may be a flow-on effect to the Pygmy Right Whale andits distribution will move south to find its prey. More information is needed on the importance of continental shelf and inshore plankton as a food source for Pygmy Right Whales.","Arnold (1987) | Baker (1985) | Barnes & McLeod (1984) | Beddard (1901) | Best (2007) | Bisconti (2012) | Buchholtz (2011) | Budylenko et al.

Balaena marginata Gray, 1846 , “Inhab. W. Australia.” This species is monotypic. Distribution. Southern Hemisphere, circumpolar, generally between 30° S and 55° S but can occur north to 19° S if cold currents are present. Descriptive notes. Total length 590- 650 cm; weight 2850-3863 kg. Female Pygmy Right Whales are slightly longer than males. In a sample of physically mature skeletons, females averaged 634 cm in length and males 610 cm. The smallest physically mature specimen (a male) was 590 cm. Weights of only five adult Pygmy Right Whales have been recorded. Flippers are 66-90 cm, dorsalfin is 21-35 cm, and flukes are 135-200 cm. Relative to body length, several external measurements increase in length as an individual grows from juvenile to adult: dorsal fin from ¢.3% to 5%, flippers from c.11% to 13%, and flukes from c.23% to 29%. Flukes have a distinct median notch that is 5-9 cm deep. Body of the adult Pygmy Right Whale is broad, giving it a bulky appearance. Flippers are small compared with other baleen whales and are slightly rounded at their tips. Relative to total body length of an adult Pygmy Right Whale, dorsal fin is situated ¢.65% of the way back from tip of rostrum. Newborns are c.200 cm in length at birth; the smallest stranded individual was 190 cm, and largest fetus had a 212cm body length. Pygmy Right Whales are medium to dark gray above and almost white below. There are several distinctive crescent-shaped, pale markings on and just behind the head. The one above the flipper is similar to the Antarctic Minke Whale ( Balaenoptera bonaerensis ), but the Pygmy Right Whale has a gray flare running forward of the eye. The most distinctive external features of the Pygmy Right Whale are absence of throat grooves, arched jaw (similar to but not as marked as in the true right whale family, Balaenidae ), very narrow rostrum when seen from above, and, if mouth is open, long baleen plates and a white or cream band of gum into which they are embedded. This latter feature is often observed at the water’s surface because there is a tendency for rostrum to be raised out of water at an angle. Two to eight mandibular hairs and several maxillary hairs are present on neonatal Pygmy Right Whales; mandibular hair follicles can persistent into adulthood. There are 213-265 baleen plates on each side of the upper jaw. Color and form of baleen plates are unique to the Pygmy Right Whale: they are long (longest plate 88 cm) and narrow, and white to cream with a darker external band of black, brown, or deep gray; baleen bristles are the same color as the inside of baleen plates and very fine in texture (0-1 mm diameter). They were described by Gray in 1870 as “the most beautiful, the most Flexible, most elastic, and the toughest whalebone or baleen yet discovered.” Baleen plates are short at birth (longest plate c.6 cm) and grow more rapidly after weaning at an estimated five months of age. Habitat. There have been few sightings oflive Pygmy Right Whales “at sea,” and much of the perceived knowledge of habitat use comes from localities of stranded and beachcast whales. Pygmy Right Whales have been seen in the open ocean, on continental shelves, and close to the coast of southern continents but not Antarctica. Enrichment by abundant meso-zooplankton (e.g. upwelling and convergences) is likely an important factor in determining where Pygmy Right Whales live. Distribution of the Pygmy Right Whale encompasses waters where sea surface temperatures are ¢.5-20°C. Food and Feeding. Thereis limited information on the diet of the Pygmy Right Whale. Stomach contents ofsix individuals have been reported, and copepods and small euphausiids were abundant in some cases. Amphipods have also been recorded. Calanoid copepods included Centropages brachiatus and Calanoides carinatus in an individual from South Africa and Calanusfinmarchicus in individuals caught in the South Atlantic. Small euphausiids found in stomachs of a few stranded Pygmy Right Whales from New Zealand and Australia have not identified to species, but the small euphausiid Nyctiphanes australis is abundant in that region. The amphipod Themisto guadichaudii was present in small amounts in a stranded juvenile Pygmy Right Whale from South Africa. Knowledge ofthe life cycle of trematodes and cestodes found in intestines of Pygmy Right Whales may augment insight on what species they consume. Mode of feeding has not been confirmed, but very long baleen plates and lack of throat grooves suggests a similar mode to right whales and Bowhead Whales (i.e. skimming as opposed to gulping). Presence of a few bird feathers in stomachs of Pygmy Right Whales may indicate surface-feeding behavior. Several groups of Pygmy Right Whales have been observed feeding at or near the Subtropical Convergence south of Australia and New Zealand, and individuals have been seen feeding in coastal areas. Suspected feeding behavior was observed in a 3m juvenile that was studied during an extended stay in a large bay on the southern coast of Australia. The juvenile’s behavior included surface skimming and stirring up sediment in a sea grass bed; abundant plankton was reported in the bay at the same time. There is some evidence that Pygmy Right Whales feed in upwelled water on the continental shelf, over seamounts, and at the Subtropical Convergence in the region of Australia and New Zealand. Off Namibia, there appears to be an association with the cold, highly productive Benguela Current. Breeding. Birthing grounds have not been reported for the Pygmy Right Whale. Stranding records provide some evidence that births and nursing may be more common in the northern parts of its distribution, which are north of ¢.41° S in the region of Australia and New Zealand. A preponderance of stranded juveniles of about weaning length along the Namibian coast is evidence of a similar trend off Africa. Mating of Pygmy Right Whales has not been observed. A protracted birthing and mating period of about eight months has been suggested, possibly in April-October. Gestation length is not known, but limited indirect information suggests that it is likely 10-12 months. To date, there is no confirmed evidence of twinning although there is an unconfirmed report of two late-stage fetuses in a stranded female from Tasmania in 1960. Left and right ovaries are functional. Only seven fetuses and neonates have been sexed, giving a ratio of four males to seven females. Future studies of the reproductive organs of stranded individuals may reveal if a post-partum estrus occurs in the Pygmy Right Whale, as it does rarely in some other species of baleen whales. Like all cetaceans, female Pygmy Right Whales have twoteats located in smallslits, one on each side of the urogenital slit. Mammary glands of a female with a late-term fetus (212 cm in length) were 80-90 cm long and not producing milk. Testes of a mature male were c.0.9-1 kg. Although there are no age estimates for Pygmy Right Whales, age at weaning was calculated by plotting body lengths of stranded individuals for fetuses and pre-weaning juveniles against month of death. Estimated age at weaning was about five months, which is consistent with some other species of baleen whales. Body length at weaning is probably 300-350 cm. Too few specimens have been studied to accurately determine length at sexual maturity, but it is likely 450-550 cm in both sexes. Additional evidence to support this hypothesis is that all individual Pygmy Right Whales studied to date, greater than or equal to 590 cm in body length, were physically mature and sexual maturity precedes physical maturity in most mammals. Activity patterns. There have been very few observations of live Pygmy Right Whales, the longest duration of which was a 3m juvenile that remained in Portland Harbour, Victoria, Australia, for just over two months. During much ofits stay in the harbor, it surfaced to breathe at intervals of c.1-5 minutes. Some resting behavior was observed during the day, but swimming and long and short dives were noted for much of the day.

They feed in areas of deep ocean water and at depths of 200 m or more. At greater depths—up to more than 1000 m—they presumably feed on benthopelagic and mesopelagic squid and fish.","Hooded Seals are born from March through early April and are weaned after a brief four days of nursing on milk with ¢.60% fat. Females mate just after their offspring are weaned, and non-parturient females are presumably estrous and mate in early to mid-March. Adult male Hooded Seals compete with each other for the opportunity to mate with estrous females, sometimes by physical combat but usually with visual and vocal threat displays. They appear to be promiscuous and search for other receptive females as soon as they have mated with one, although they might sometimes be polygynous in areas where several females give birth relatively close together. The fertilized egg grows briefly and then remains free-floating for c.16 weeks when it attaches to the uterine wall and fetal development continues.

Norwegian, Greenlandic, Canadian, and Russian sealers have long harvested Hooded Seals, when they are on ice to breed and molt, for meat, oil from blubber, and skins, especially those of young. Off Greenland and Canada, hunting of Hooded Seals was often associated with harvest of Harp Seals ( Pagophilus groenlandicus ) and Greenland sharks (Somniosus macrocephalus). In the early 1900s, total annual commercial harvests were as high as 62,000 Hooded Seals in several areas. They are still harvested in some areas, although in substantially lower numbers of several thousand or less. Overall, the eastern stock of Hooded Seals declined from ¢.500,000 individuals to just ¢.70,000 individuals in the past few decades, and causes of this decline are unknown. Dependence of Hooded Seals on pack ice and their relatively restricted distribution suggest that climate change could cause further decline in their abundance. Conservation concern for the Hooded Seal dates back to the 1870s, and numerous international management plans, agreements, treaties, and harvest quotas, have been put in place. For example, Denmark has protected molting Hooded Seals in the Denmark Strait since 1961, harvesting has been banned in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence since 1972, and the European Commission banned importation of seal products.","Andersen et al.

Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List because the breeding stock in the north-eastern North Atlantic Ocean has declined by 85-90% in the past 40-60 years, and despite protective measures, it continues to decline. Norwegian, Greenlandic, Canadian, and Russian sealers have long harvested Hooded Seals, when they are on ice to breed and molt, for meat, oil from blubber, and skins, especially those of young. Off Greenland and Canada, hunting of Hooded Seals was often associated with harvest of Harp Seals ( Pagophilus groenlandicus ) and Greenland sharks (Somniosus macrocephalus). In the early 1900s, total annual commercial harvests were as high as 62,000 Hooded Seals in several areas. They are still harvested in some areas, although in substantially lower numbers of several thousand or less. Overall, the eastern stock of Hooded Seals declined from ¢.500,000 individuals to just ¢.70,000 individuals in the past few decades, and causes of this decline are unknown. Dependence of Hooded Seals on pack ice and their relatively restricted distribution suggest that climate change could cause further decline in their abundance. Conservation concern for the Hooded Seal dates back to the 1870s, and numerous international management plans, agreements, treaties, and harvest quotas, have been put in place. For example, Denmark has protected molting Hooded Seals in the Denmark Strait since 1961, harvesting has been banned in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence since 1972, and the European Commission banned importation of seal products.

Adult females are somewhat larger than males. Offspring have lanugo (fine, soft hair) in utero that is shed just before birth when they then have silver-blue to brown pelage. Adult Bearded Seals are uniformly gray to dark brown, slightly darker dorsally, and have scattered splotches over their bodies. Hair is short and shed in April-August, with a peak in May-June. One relatively unique characteristic, shared only with monk seals ( Monachus spp. ), is that Breaded Seals have four teats rather than two teats as in all other phocid carnivores.","Widely but patchily distributed in Arctic and subarctic regions of the North Pacific and North Atlantic oceans. Bearded Seals are typically found in areas with broken free-floating pack ice, and because of their benthic feeding habits, they live primarily in shallow waters overlying continental shelves such as in the Bering and Barents seas. For example, south of Saint Lawrence Island, Alaska, in late winter, Bearded Seals avoided large ice floes (more than 48 m in diameter) and preferred areas of freefloating pack ice between large and small (less than 20 m in diameter) ice floes; they occurred in areas with 70-90% ice cover and selected areas of high benthic biomass. In contrast, sympatric Ringed Seals ( Pusa hispida ) and Walruses ( Odobenus rosmarus ) preferred large ice floes, and Spotted Seals ( Phoca largha ) preferred small ice floes. In Canadian waters, greatest densities appear to be in Hudson and Baffin bays and along the west coast of Banks Island.","Bearded Seals are not deep divers and eat a diversity of benthic and epibenthic prey at depths of 100 m or less, using a combination of waterjetting and suction feeding in soft bottom substrates. Their primary prey lives on or near the seafloor, but they also eat some infauna and schooling and demersal fish. Diets of Bearded Seals are dominated by mollusks (clams and sea snails), crustaceans (shrimps and crabs), fish ( Gadidae , Osmeridae , Zoarcidae , Cottidae , and flatfish), and cephalopods (squid). In the Bering and Chukchi seas region, Bearded Seals had the highest diversity of invertebrate prey types with most stomachs containing shrimps (71%) and molluscs (61%), and consume more flatfish and sculpin ( Cottidae ) than the sympatric Ringed Seals and Spotted Seals. Fatty acid composition of blubber of Bearded Seals from subsistence harvests near Little Diomede Island, Alaska (USA), differed from that of sympatric Ringed Seals, Spotted Seals, and Ribbon Seals ( Histriophoca fasciata ). The particular concentration of a monounsaturated fatty acid (16:1n-7) suggested that Bearded Seals ate a diet dominated by benthic mollusks. Such comparisons of fatty acids are not only useful as an index of diet but also as a benchmark to assess future climate change.","Bearded Seals are born from mid-March through early May and are weaned at 2-3 weeks old. Estrous females mate from mid-March through mid-June. The fertilized egg develops briefly and then floats freely and dormant for about two months before attaching to the uterine wall and resuming development. Most females are sexually mature at 2-7 years old and almost all by eight years old. About 85% offemales give birth each year. Males are sexually mature at 6-7 years old. Structure of the breeding system of Breaded Seals is poorly known, although males have elaborate underwater vocalizations and bubble displays that may be used to attract estrous females or displace other males. Bearded Seals normally live 20-25 years.","Nursing Bearded Seals can enter the water when they are only a few hours old, perhaps an adaptation to avoid predation by Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus). Diving abilities of young Bearded Seals develop quickly, and they can dive repeatedly for up to ¢.5 minutes to depths of more than 90 m within a couple of weeks after birth and to more than 450 m by the end of their first year. Mothers and their offspring spend about one-half of their time in the water during the brief lactation period, hauling out on ice only for offspring to suckle; females occasionally leave their offspring on the ice while they forage. Dives of adult Bearded Seals are usually less than 100 m in shallow coastal or continental shelf waters where they feed on epibenthic and benthic prey. Dives last ¢.10 minutes but can be as long as 25 minutes.","Bearded Seals are thought to be year-round residents in some areas, but mobile in others areas, following the ice edge as it moves south in autumn and winter and then recedes in spring and summer. Some Bearded Seals overwinter in areas where persistent polynyas (open water surrounded by sea ice) occur. They are solitary and sparsely distributed throughout most of the year, even during the breeding season when they haul-out to give birth and mate. Bearded Seals are known to wander outside the Arctic and have been reported south to Spain and Portugal in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, and to the Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod, USA, in the western North Atlantic Ocean.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

Small numbers of Ringed Seals live in freshwater: the “Lake Saimaa Ringed Seal” (P. h. saimensis) in southern Finland and the “Lake Ladoga Ringed Seal” (P. h. ladogensis) in western Russia.","The diet of Ringed Seals is relatively diverse and varies depending on geographical area, marine habitat types, and regional composition offish and invertebrate communities. Most prey is small and includes zooplankton and nekton, epibenthic cephalopods and fish, and mid-water schooling fish. Although groups of Ringed Seals can occur near concentrations of schooling fish—their preferred prey—they appear to hunt and capture prey alone without any direct interactions among conspecifics. Arctic cod ( Boreogadus saida and Arctogadus glacialis), saffron cod ( Eleginus gracilis), redfish (Sebastes spp.), capelin ( Mallotus villosus), sculpin ( Cottidae ), and herring ( Clupea spp. ) are often reported to be their most important prey species. Invertebrate prey seems to become more important in the open-water season and often dominates diets of young Ringed Seals. Large amphipods (e.g. Themisto libellula), krill (e.g. Thysanoessa inermis), mysids (e.g. Mysis oculata), shrimps (e.g. Pandalus spp., Eualus spp., Lebbeus polaris, Crangon septemspinosa), and cephalopods (e.g. Gonatus spp.) are eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally. Fatty acid composition of blubber of Ringed Seals from subsistence harvests near Little Diomede Island, Alaska (USA), differed from that of sympatric Bearded Seals ( Erignathus barbatus ), Ribbon Seals ( Histriophoca fasciata ) and Spotted Seals, suggesting dietary separation. Such comparisons of fatty acids are not only useful as an index of diet but also as a benchmark to assess future climate change. Most foraging dives of Ringed Seals are less than 100 m deep, although they occasionally dive to 300 m, or a little more.",Female Ringed Seals give birth in March-April in small caves or lairs that they excavate below the surface of sea ice and fast ice under hummocks formed by pressure ridges. They nurse their offspring for c.4-6 weeks and mate near the time offspring are weaned. The fertilized egg develops briefly and then remains freefloating and dormant for c.2-3 months before it attaches to the uterine wall and development and growth resume. Adult male Ringed Seals appear to be territorial around breathing holes near a birth lair and are vocally and physically aggressive underwater to defend access to holes and females against other males. Females are sexually mature at c¢.4-6 years old and males at about seven years old. Maximum longevity is up to 45 years.,"Male and female Ringed Seals begin feeding intensely just after the breeding season to regain body mass that they lost and restore their condition to prepare to molt. Ringed Seals molt in June—July and fast for a couple of weeks while they are hauled out on ice floes or, in Lake Saimaa, on land. Between molting and breeding seasons and breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seals appear to dive and forage constantly, hauling out on ice floes and forming sea ice for brief periods to rest.","Ringed Seals are mostly solitary throughout the year, although they do loosely aggregate in large numbers where ice is limited during breeding and molting seasons, or when feeding near large concentrations of schooling fish. Juvenile Ringed Seals are known to wander quite far south to New Jersey (USA) and Portugal in the North Atlantic Ocean and Zhejiang (China) and California (USA) in the North Pacific Ocean, particularly in summer.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Nevertheless, the IUCN classification concludes that the population trend of the Ringed Seal is unknown and that a realistic assessment of its conservation is seriously affected by difficulties in obtaining accurate population estimates because of its widespread and variable distribution, much of it in remote, high-latitude Arctic sea ice, which is very difficult to survey. For example, although some estimates suggested that the population of the “Arctic Ringed Seal” (P. h. hispida ) might have been 6-7 million in the 1970s and 2-5 million in the early 2000s, consensus seems to indicated a much smaller overall population now. Growing concern over the loss of sea ice throughout Arctic distribution of the Ringed Seal as a result climate change, among other more localized factors, has prompted the listing of all five subspecies of the Ringed Seal as endangered or threatened under the US Endangered Species Act. Numbers of the Lake Saimaa Ringed Seal in southern Finland have declined from several thousand to ¢.200-250 individuals from poaching, pollution (e.g. mercury), and changes in ice coverage. It has been protected under Finnish Law since 1955 and has been listed as a foreign endangered species under the US Endangered Species Act since 1993. Poaching, fisheries bycatch (10-16% of the annual mortality), and substantial pollution in the lake have negatively affected the Lake Ladoga Ringed Seal; its population was estimated at ¢.9000 individuals in the late 20"" century and ¢.3000-5000 individuals in 2007. It is listed as rare in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and hunting has been prohibited since 1980;it waslisted as a foreign endangered species under the US Endangered Species Act in 2012. The Arctic Ringed Seal, the “Baltic Sea Ringed Seal” (P. h. botnica), and the “Okhotsk Ringed Seal” (P. h. ochotensis ) were listed as foreign threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act in 2012. The population of Arctic Ringed Seal in Alaskan waters, under the jurisdiction of US Marine Mammal Protection Act, is estimated at 249,000 individuals, and subsistence harvest is regulated. Humans have hunted Ringed Seals for thousands of years for food, oil, and skins for clothing and covers for kayaks. Villagers in Greenland, Canada, and coastal Russia kill tens of thousands of Ringed Seals annually for subsistence—all regulated by the respective governments.

Ringed Seal Pusa hispida French: Phoque annelé / German: Ringelrobbe / Spanish: Foca anillada Other common names: Fjord Seal , Jar Seal; Arctic Ringed Seal (hispida); Baltic Sea Ringed Seal (botnica); Lake Ladoga Ringed Seal (ladogensis); Sea of Okhotsk Ringed Seal (ochotensis); Lake Saimaa Ringed Seal (saimensis) Taxonomy. Phoca hispida Schreber, 1775 , “Man fangt ihn auf den Kiisten von Gronland und Labrader” (= Greenland and Labrador). Several subspecies have been proposed based on geographicalisolation. Five subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. P. h. hispida Schreber, 1775 — Arctic Ocean. P h. botnica Gmelin, 1788 — Baltic Sea. P. h. ladogensis Nordqvist, 1889 — Lake Ladoga (W Russia). Ph. ochotensis Pallas, 1811 — Sea of Okhotsk and N Japan (Hokkaido). P. h. saimensis Nordqvist, 1889 — Lake Saimaa (S Finland). Descriptive notes. Total length 110-160 cm; weight ¢.50-90 kg. Newborns are 60-65 cm in length and weigh 4.5-5.5 kg. Ringed Seals are relatively small and plump phocid carnivores. They have robust nails on foreflippers used to abrade ice to excavate birth lairs and to keep breathing holes open in winter. Offspring are born with a woolly lanugo (fine, soft hair) that is shed when hey are c.2-3 weeks old. It is replaced by a relatively unspotted pelage that is gray dorsally and lighter silver ventrally. Pelage of an adult Ringed Sealis dark dorsally and lighter ventrally, with extensive rings covering back, top of head, and sides and with dark blotches on lower sides and ventrum. Habitat.

Adult Caspian Seals have dark spots on a lighter gray background dorsally and on a paler gray to white background ventrally, and adult males can also have scattered spotting ventrally compared with few ventral spots on adult females. Habitat. Restricted to the inland Caspian Sea in western Russia. Caspian Seals are often associated with ice that forms in the shallow northern part of the Caspian Sea in autumn and winter. Food and Feeding. The diet of the Caspian Seal is relatively diverse, depending on location. It includes some crustaceans in autumn and winter, and clupeid fish ( Clupeonella spp. ), sand smelts ( Atherina boyeri caspica ), carp, and Caspian roach (Rutilus rutilus caspicus) in spring and summer. Species of Clupeonella historically make up a major proportion of the total annual diet of the Caspian Seal. When Caspian Seals are in the Ural Estuary in autumn, they focus on carp, pike-perch (Sander lucioperca), and Caspian roach. Breeding. Caspian Seals are born on sea-ice from late January through early February and are weaned at 4-5 weeks old. Females bred shortly after their offspring are weaned in late February-March, or slightly earlier if they did not give birth that year. Females are sexually mature at aboutfive years old, but most females do not give birth for the first time until they are about seven years old. Males are sexually mature at ¢.6-7 years old. Caspian Seals appear to be monogamous. Maximum age of Caspian Seals collected from Pearl Island was 43-5 years for females and 33-5 years for males. Activity patterns. Adult female Caspian Seals molt in late February and early March, and adult males molt in late March and early April. Despite centuries of intense commercial harvest of Caspian Seals,little is known about their behavior. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Many Caspian Seals move to the north-eastern, shallow reach of the Caspian Sea in autumn when ice begins to form. They remain there, maintaining breathing holes in ice, until early May when they molt and begin to move south in summer to the deeper areas of the Caspian Sea. Others assemble in the middle of the sea after it freezes over, and a few breed on islands in the southern Caspian Sea. Status and Conservation. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Caspian Seals have been hunted for several hundred years, with annual harvests of ¢.160,000 ind/ year in the late 1700s and early 1800s. On average, c.115,000 Caspian Seals were killed from the 1860s through the late 1930s, with a record number of ¢.227,000 individuals killed in 1935. Regulation of the harvest of Caspian Seals began in the late 1960s, with annual harvests after that of ¢.60,000 weaned offspring. The population is estimated to have numbered c.1-1-5 million individuals but declined by ¢.90% to ¢.100,000 individuals by 2005 because of unsustainable harvesting during most of the 20™ century. Mass mortality events in 1997, 2000, and 2001, which killed several thousand Caspian Seals each year, have been attributed to a canine distemper-like virus. Substantial loss of habitat has resulted from reduction of freshwater input to the Caspian Sea because of dams on the Volga River to divert water for agriculture. Commercial fishing and pollution have reduced prey availability, causing reproductive failure of Caspian Seals, greatly compromising their future. Bibliography.

Short pelage of the Harbor Seal fades to light tan to brown for much of the year in southern parts of its distribution and, to a lesser extent, farther north. Adult male Harbor Seals can be slightly larger than adult females, and those in the Pacific Ocean are larger than those in the Atlantic Ocean. Offspring are sometimes born with long creamy white lanugo (fine, soft hair) that is shed shortly after birth, but in most areas, lanugo is shed in utero.","Resting habitat on intertidal rocks and reefs, mudflats and sandbars, sandy and pebbly beaches, and seasonal pack ice and fastice (ice fastened to land) in some areas. Harbor Seals give birth on sandy and pebbly beaches. Primary habitat is along outer continental and island coastlines and in bays and harbors, but occasionally on offshore islands. Harbor Seals mainly forage in relatively shallow coastal or near-island habitats, although they can feed at considerable depths; dives of up to 800 m have been recorded.","Harbor Seals have a very diverse, geographically variable diet, but they generally prey on abundant and easily available foods so a few species tend to dominate diets at any one location and time of year. Prey includes epibenthic and small schooling fish ( Gadidae , Clupeidae , Osmeridae , Ammodytidae , Cottidae , Salmonidae , and a variety of flatfish), octopuses, squid, and crustaceans. Harbor Seals hunted for prey in lagoons and estuaries and bays, near-shore kelp beds, and sometimes deeper, offshore sandy-bottom habitats.","Timing of births of Harbor Seals varies greatly geographically. They are born in March-April in Baja California (Mexico) and southern California (USA) and then progressively later farther north. Females in Oregon and Washington (USA) give birth in May-June and those in the Aleutian Islands in June-July. In the North Atlantic Ocean, females give birth in May-July, depending on region. Offspring are nursed for 3-4 weeks and then abruptly weaned and abandoned. Female Harbor Seals mate just before or after they wean their offspring. Non-parturient mature females come into estrus and mate a bit earlier. Copulations evidently occur only in the water. Adult male Harbor Seals patrol haul-out areas and visually, vocally, and physically threaten other adult males, and some displays may function to attract females. After females are impregnated, the embryo develops briefly and then is then dormant and free-floating until it attaches to the uterine wall and development resumes about two months later. Full gestation is about eleven months, but most fetal growth occurs during the last eight months or so. Femalesare sexually mature at 3-6 years old and males at 5-7 years old. Longevity is typically 35 years for females and 25 years for males, but it is lower for Harbor Seals in the Pacific Ocean at ¢.30 years for females and c¢.20 years for males.","Harbor Seals frequently haul-out to rest on land or intertidal reefs, mudflats, and sandbars; they haul-out daily in some seasons but less often and for briefer periods in autumn and winter. During these resting bouts, they are vigilant and scan the area, evidently for potential terrestrial predators or human intruders. Although Harbor Seals are generally very sensitive to human presence and flee quickly to the water, they have become relatively tame and approachable in some areas like at Children’s Cove in downtown La Jolla, California, USA. When in the water, they appear to dive and forage continually for up to 15-20 minutes at a time, depending on depth of water and type of marine habitat. Harbor Seals appear to be solitary when foraging. Offspring are precocial and can swim at birth. Most nursing appears to occur on land, but offspring in most areas accompany females on daily tripsto sea. In a few locations, females evidently leave their offspring on the beach while they forage for brief periods. Harbor Seals molt in April-August, depending on geographical location, age, and sex. They haul-out more often and spend more time ashore when molting, which lasts c.2-3 weeks.","Harbor Seals are thought to live and forage relatively near their haul-out sites, although movements or dispersal of tagged individuals, particularlyjuveniles, of several hundred kilometers have been document ed. There is no evidence of seasonal migration. Harbor Seals are gregarious and can occur in groups of hundreds, and sometimes several thousand, especially when molting in spring and summer, at particular terrestrial haul-out sites and mudflats and sandbars. Nevertheless, they are not particularly social, and most interactions between them on shore are brief visual and vocal threats to keep some distance between them.","Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. In 2013, the population of the “Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal” ( P. v. richardii ) in the freshwater Iliamna Lake, Alaska, was petitioned to the listed as a Distinct Population Segment under the US Endangered Species Act. Harbor Sealslive along coasts of western North America from Baja California north through waters of California, Oregon, and Washington and the eastern Aleutian Islands; their distribution continues through the central and western Aleutian Islands, south to Japan and north to Kamchatka and into the Sea of Okhotsk; and they also range into the eastern Bering Sea to Nome, Alaska, and the Pribilof Islands and in the western Bering Sea to the Commander Islands. In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, they are present in Iceland and Svalbard, and along the coasts of Norway, the North Sea, the British Isles, northern France, and into the southern Baltic Sea. In the western Atlantic Ocean, they occur along the coast of south-western Greenland and then range from south-western Baffin Island south to Massachusetts (USA), with occasional wanderers as far south as Florida. A relatively large colony occursat Sable Island off Nova Scotia, and a small population of 120-600 individuals inhabits freshwaters in the Ungava Peninsula. Harbor Seals have been hunted for food, oil, and skins for centuries by aboriginal cultures and more contemporary coastal communities, to different extents, throughout their extensive distribution. They were killed in large numbers in some areas in the 20"" century for bounty because of perceived conflict with commercial fisheries. Outbreaks of distemper-like viruses greatly reduced populations of Harbor Seals in parts of Europe and the western North Atlantic Ocean in the 1980s and 1990s. Global population of Harbor Seals has been loosely estimated at ¢.500,000 individuals, with ¢.300,000 individuals in the North Pacific Ocean, including ¢.160,000 individuals in waters of Alaska (where numbers have greatly declined in the Aleutian Islands from undetermined causes).","Baird (2001) | Bigg (1969, 1981) | Boveng et al.

Head of adult Harp Seals is also black.","Subarctic waters and Arctic regions of the North Atlantic Ocean, particularly tied to the southern and northern limits of seasonal pack ice. Harp Seals are closely associated with the southern extent of seasonal sea ice in late winter and spring, where they haul-out to give birth and then later to molt. They appear to be pelagic for the rest of the year because they feed and range widely in open waters and marginal sea ice.","Harp Seals have a diverse diet of fish and invertebrates, but their primary prey is a few species of euphausiid crustaceans (Thyanoessa spp.) and smaller fish like capelin ( Mallotus villosus), sand eel ( Ammodytes sp. ), and Arctic cod ( Boreogadus sada and Arctogadus glacialis). Harp seals are relatively shallow divers, usually to less than 100 m, but they have been recorded descending to c.400 m. Overall, deepest dives occur during the day in winter. When actively feeding after breeding and molting periods, Harp Seals often congregate in relatively large groups along ice edges and other oceanographic features where prey is concentrated.","Female Harp Seals give birth to a single offspring beginning in late February through mid-March. Young are nursed for c.12 days, after which they are abruptly weaned. Adult males patrol ice edges and then mate with females when they enter the water to start foraging. Male Harp Seals appear to be promiscuous, and there is little sexual dimorphism in size or appearance. After a female has conceived, the embryo develops briefly and then is dormant for c.2-3 months before it attaches to the uterine wall and fetal development resumes. Females are sexually mature at 4-7 years old, and 85-90% of them can give birth each year after that. Males are sexually mature at c¢.7-8 years old.

Humans have hunted Harp Seals throughout their distribution for thousands of years and into current times. The earliest records of harvest of Harp Seals in the north-western Atlantic Ocean are from Basque whalers in the 1500s, followed by French settlers along the Saint Lawrence River, Canada, who used land-based netting techniques in the mid-1600s. By the mid-1700s, French-Canadians harvest an estimated 6000 Harp Seals/ year for oil (estimated at 500 tons of oil/year) and pelts, and English settlers in Newfoundland harvested 7000-12,800 Harp Seals/year. As ship-based sealing developed in the 1800s, harvest of Harp Seals rose substantially to ¢.117,000 ind/year, and in 1818-1862, annual harvest in many of those years was estimated at ¢.500,000 individuals, peaking at 640,000-740,000 ind/year. During this period, an estimated 18:3 million Harp Seals were harvested in the north-western Atlantic Ocean. Total harvest in the north-eastern part of the distribution of the Harp Seal in 1860-1900 was estimated at 12-8 million individuals. In the 20"" century, Harp Seals became valued more for their pelts than their oil and harvests generally decreased. About one million seals were killed in the north-western Atlantic Ocean in 2004-2007, primarily young less than three days old, mostly for their pelts but also for oil and bacula (penis bone). Harp Seals are concentrated in three major population centers. Thefirst stock is in the White Sea and Barents Sea (East Ice) with ¢.2,000,000 individuals in 2005, the second (West Ice) in the Greenland Sea near Jan Mayen with ¢.635,000 individuals in 2005, and the third, the largest, in the north-western Atlantic Ocean near southern Labrador, Newfoundland, and Gulf of Saint Lawrence with 5-5 million individuals in 2007. Populations in the three main reproductive areas have apparently declined because of continued harvest, particularly in Canadian waters of the north-western Atlantic stock where harvest levels increased in the 2000s and may be exceeding sustainable levels by 1-5-5-9 times. There are no recent estimates of range-wide abundance of the Harp Seal, although it is the most abundant species of seals in the Northern Hemisphere and may still number close to eight million individuals. Commercial fisheries may be deceasing prey availability for Harp Seals, and bycatch in fishing nets has been problematic off the northern coast of Norway, for example, where an estimated 100,000 individuals in 1987 and 21,474 individuals in 1988 were killed in fishing nets.

Northern Elephant Seals are smaller that Southern Elephant Seals (M. leonina ). Sexual dimorphism in body size and shape of Northern Elephant Seals develops at 3—4 years old. Newborn males and females are similarsize, with total length of ¢.115-125 cm and weight of 25-35 kg.

Nose of a male Northern Elephant Seals begins to elongate at puberty at 3-5 years old;it is a distinct elongated proboscis and distinct secondary sexual characteristic at physical maturity when a male is 8-10 years old. Males’ noses help resonate and amplify their pulsed threat vocalizations. Dentition is sexually dimorphic but adapted in both sexes for snatching and firmly grasping prey, which is evidently swallowed whole. Canine teeth of males are large and robust and function as offensive weapons during fights during the breeding season. Canine teeth of females are substantially smaller and gracile but sharp. Post-canine teeth are poorly developed in all seals and non-functional. Skin on neck and chest of a sexually mature male Northern Elephant Seal thickens and becomes heavily calloused with age. Hairis sparse, short, and course. Juvenile and adult Northern Elephant Seals shed their hair once each year, which involves shedding of the upper layer of epidermis and embedded hair in large patches, known as a catastrophic molt. New hair begins emerging from reactivated follicles over 5-10 days. Northern Elephant Seals are ashore continuously during this molt for c.3 weeks, and they fast.Juveniles molt in April, adult females in late April-May, subadult males in late May-June, and adult males in July-August.","Breed primarily on offshore island beaches from central Baja California (Mexico) north to Ano Nuevo Island in central California, although there are a few mainland breeding sites in central California at Piedras Blancas, Ano Nuevo Point, and Point Reyes.

Foraging habitat is along the continental shelf and in distant offshore and deep oceanic (i.e. mesopelagic habitats) waters from southern Baja California north to the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands and the central North Pacific Ocean.","Northern Elephant Seals eat a variety of mesopelagic cephalopods and fish, and benthic small sharks, rays, and fish. More than one-half of these species are squid, and many of their deep-water prey have bioluminescent organs. When at sea for 3-10 months/year, Northern Elephant Seals dive relentlessly to depths up to 1600 m but principally to 300-400 m and 600-800 m and spend relatively little time at the surface breathing. Dives last 12-60 minutes, depending on age, sex, and size of individual. Male Northern Elephant Seals generally dive for longer (c.30 minutes) but forage over the continental shelf, and females use deeper open water and normally dive to 400-800 m.","Adult males and reproductive females are ashore and fast for one (females) to three (adult males) months during the breeding season in December—February. Some non-reproductive females and juveniles are ashore to rest for a couple of weeks in October and early November. Northern Elephant Seals are highly polygynous, and dominant males mate with several to perhaps a few dozen females during a single breeding season, depending on breeding site dimensions and topography. Adult and subadult males arrive at colonies in December and early January and establish dominance hierarchies based on age and size. They continue to challenge and interact with each other throughout the breeding season that lasts several months. Females arrive after males and give birth to a single offspring (twins have never been observed) c.7-8 days after coming ashore. A female nurses her offspring for ¢.27 days, comes into estrus and is quickly mated, and then abruptly weans and abandons her offspring and returns to sea to forage for about three months. Female arrivals are not synchronous and occur from late December through early February. Consequently, estrus is not synchronous so copulations at colonies can occur anytime from mid-January through the end of February. Breeding aggregations of Northern Elephant Seals are not harems because males do not control movements of females on beaches nor is any male capable of excluding all other males from access to females. All males in social hierarchies attempt to remain in locations that provide brief access to estrous females. They compete with each other for opportunities to gain access to females when they become receptive during a brief 1-2 day period. The dominant male will generally have the largest number of copulations at particular breeding aggregations and presumably will have fathered the largest number of offspring there in the subsequent breeding season. After females are impregnated, the fertilized egg develops to the blastocyst stage but remains free-floating for ¢.2-3 months before it attaches to the uterine wall (delayed implantation) and then resumes development. Consequently, gestation is c.11 months although fetal growth is primarily 7-8 months after implantation of the blastocyst. Females are sexually mature at 2—4 years old, depending on growth during their first several years of life and can give birth annually although 8-20% skip a year between pregnancies. Males are sexually mature at 6-7 years old but generally not socially mature and able to compete in social hierarchies until they are 8-10 years old. Females can live for 18 years, but males generally do not live longer than 12-14 years.","When ashore while breeding, molting, and fasting, adult female Northern Elephant Seals attempt to conserve energy by minimizing activity and movements to maximize energy transfer to their suckling offspring. Adult males reserve as much energy as possible to compete with each other and establish their rank in the social hierarchy and to preserve opportunities to mate with estrous females. Males establish and maintain social hierarchies with visual displays, then vocal threats, and occasionally chases, but rarely physical battles. Although direct physical fights are uncommon, they can be bloody and brutal on occasion and last for 15 minutes or more. When not ashore to breed and molt, Northern Elephant Seals dive continually for 2-10 months or more and rarely spend more than several minutes at the water’s surface to breathe.","Adult Northern Elephant Seals make two long-distance migrations between offshore island and continental mainland breeding and molting sites in Baja and southern and central California to the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (males) and the central North Pacific Ocean (females). Females aggregate on island and mainland beaches to breed in winter but are relatively asocial, devoting their attention and time to nursing and protecting their offspring. Interactions among females are mostly aggressive to defend their limited space and offspring against other females and to chase away foreign offspring or to rebuff males attempting to mount and mate with them when they are not in estrus. During the breeding season, males establish social hierarchies based on age and size and aggressively interact with each other with physical and vocal displays and occasionally chases and physical encounters to maintain their rank in the hierarchy. While at sea, during most of each year and throughout their lives, Northern Elephant Seals are solitary and range over large areas of the eastern North Pacific Ocean to forage and replace substantial body mass that they lost while fasting during the preceding breeding or molting periods and prepare for the next breeding or molting period ashore. Adult males and female Northern Elephant Seals mingle together only once each year during the brief winter breeding season when they might be ashore together. Because they molt at different times, they do not encounter each other ashore during the rest of the year. When at sea, adult males and females are also spatially segregated, with brief transient overlap in foraging areas as adult males quickly pass northward in spring and southward in late summer through the offshore areas where females focus their foraging. All Northern Elephant Seals appear to be solitary at sea. Sexual segregation during foraging periods appears to develop as males enter and pass through puberty at c.4-5 years old.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Northern Elephant Seals were reduced to small numbers at most of their historic breeding and molting sites by aboriginal Indians who ranged along the islands and mainland of western North America for 10,000-12,000 years before Europeans first arrived in the 1500s and 1600s. Some very limited commercial hunting occurred, for their blubber rendered into oil, associated with commercial whaling and fur sealing in the 1700s and 1800s, particularly at Guadalupe Island, a refuge that had never been occupied by aboriginals. The Northern Elephant Seal was presumed to be extinct by 1900. A few individuals clearly survived into the 20"" century and increased at Guadalupe Island and then began showing up along coastal California a few decades later. Breeding began again at San Nicolas and San Miguel islands in southern California in the late 1940s and then farther north at Ano Nuevo Island off central California in the 1960s. The Northern Elephant Seal has continued to increase, at exponential or near-exponential rates, since then and now numbers perhaps 175,000 individuals. As a consequence of repeated population bottlenecks and reduced abundance during the past several centuries or more, most genetic variation has been lost. Indeed, there has been virtually no genetic variability detected at any genetic loci so far examined, including immune system genes. There have been no detrimental effects yet observed as a result of the loss of genetic variability. Indeed, despite an epidemic of avian influenza having passed through the population in 2009 and 2010, no associated mortality or clinical signs of disease have been observed.","Bartholomew (1952) | Boyce et al.

Northern Elephant Seal Mirounga angustirostris French: El¢phant-de-mer boréal / German: Nordlicher See-Elefant / Spanish: Elefante marino septentrional Other common names: Northern Sea Elephant Taxonomy. Mirounga angustirostris Gill, 1866 , “California.” Restricted by A. J. Poole and V. S. Schantz in 1942 to “St. Bartholomews Bay, lower California, Mexico.” Clarified by V. B. Scheffer in 1958 as Bahia Tortola (= Bahia San Bartolomé) 27° 39° N, 114° 51’ W, Baja California, Mexico.” This species is monotypic. Distribution. NE Pacific, Aleutian Is, Gulf of Alaska, and W coast of North America S to C Baja California (Mexico); occasionally to Hawaiian Is and Japan, and into the Bering Sea. Descriptive notes. Total length ¢.350-400 cm (males) and ¢.215-300 cm (females); weight ¢.1800-2500 kg (males) and 300-600 kg (females). Northern Elephant Seals are smaller that Southern Elephant Seals (M. leonina ). Sexual dimorphism in body size and shape of Northern Elephant Seals develops at 3—4 years old. Newborn males and females are similarsize, with total length of ¢.115-125 cm and weight of 25-35 kg. Offspring are black at birth and until weaned at 25-28 days postpartum and then molt into a silver-gray pelage that fades to chocolate brown dorsally and tan ventrally. Juvenile and adult pelage is light tan ventrally and brown to dark brown dorsally. Eyes are relatively large in all seals, apparent adaptations for maximizing light gathering power when foraging at great depths. Nose of a male Northern Elephant Seals begins to elongate at puberty at 3-5 years old;it is a distinct elongated proboscis and distinct secondary sexual characteristic at physical maturity when a male is 8-10 years old. Males’ noses help resonate and amplify their pulsed threat vocalizations. Dentition is sexually dimorphic but adapted in both sexes for snatching and firmly grasping prey, which is evidently swallowed whole. Canine teeth of males are large and robust and function as offensive weapons during fights during the breeding season. Canine teeth of females are substantially smaller and gracile but sharp. Post-canine teeth are poorly developed in all seals and non-functional. Skin on neck and chest of a sexually mature male Northern Elephant Seal thickens and becomes heavily calloused with age. Hairis sparse, short, and course. Juvenile and adult Northern Elephant Seals shed their hair once each year, which involves shedding of the upper layer of epidermis and embedded hair in large patches, known as a catastrophic molt. New hair begins emerging from reactivated follicles over 5-10 days. Northern Elephant Seals are ashore continuously during this molt for c.3 weeks, and they fast.Juveniles molt in April, adult females in late April-May, subadult males in late May-June, and adult males in July-August.

E. H. Barrett-Hamilton in 1902 to “pack ice, north of Ross Sea 68°S, 176°E.” This species is monotypic.",Circumpolar in the Southern Ocean.,"Total length 170-210 cm (males) and 190-250 cm (females); weight 129-216 kg (males) and 159-201 kg (females). Newborns are 105-120 cm in length and weigh 17-27 kg. Ross Seals have relatively small but robust bodies with short, broad heads. Eyes are noticeably large and forward pointing, reflecting adaptations to their deep diving and foraging habits. Teeth are all small, and post-canines are simple without shearing or grinding structure. Canine teeth are very sharply conical, apparent adaptations for catching squid that seem to be their primary prey. Short pelage is dark brown dorsally and cream or tan ventrally, with several dark stripes radiating down throat from mouth and some spotting along boundary between counter-shaded, dorsal-ventral pattern. Ross Seals molt in late December—January and perhaps into mid-February.","Confined to the Southern Ocean and sparsely distributed around the Antarctic Continent. In late autumn and early summer, breeding Ross Seals are distributed in heavily consolidated pack ice in the Ross, Amundsen, and Bellingshausen seas of West Antarctica and scattered around East Antarctica and perhaps in the western Weddell Sea. From late summer through early autumn, Ross Seals appear to be pelagic, spending most of their time north of sea-ice habitats and foraging at relatively deep depths of 200-500 m or more. Most sightings of Ross Seals have been ofsolitary individuals, but small groups and aggregations have been seen a few times. Some of these aggregations and groups were recorded in areas of sparse ice and evidently reflected absence of suitable sites to haul-out. Vagrant Ross Seals have been observed at several subantarctic islands, New Zealand, and Australia.","Ross Seals primarily eat deep-water squid and fish thatlive at depths of 100-500 m and occasionally krill when they are near sea surface. Based on stomach content analysis, their diet is ¢.47% squid, ¢.34% fish, and ¢.19% invertebrates.","Very little is known about breeding biology of Ross Seals. Age at sexual maturity is thought to be 3-4 years for females and 2-7 years for males. The few observations on reproductive biology of Ross Seals suggest that offspring are born in mid-October-November. Mating may occurjust after that in December and early January. Ross Seals make two kinds of low-frequency (100-1000 Hz) vocalizations out of the water: an explosive exhalation noise, with mouth slightly open, and a chugging, siren noise from the throat and pharynx, with rising and lowering frequencies and apparently with mouth and nostrils closed. Underwater pulse and siren calls of Ross Seals are similar to in-air calls, but their frequencies are higher (1-4 KHz) and are consistently pulse modulated at c.650/s with two independently varying tones—similar to the Walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ). These sounds might be used during aggressive intraspecific interactions and perhaps breeding displays. Ross Seals can live to 20 years, but c.12 years is probably typical.","Ross Seals forage at depths of ¢.100-200 m and occasionally as deep as 500 m or more during continuous diving for 4-8 minutes/dive. When Ross Seals are in areas of ice in spring and summer, they haul-out during the daytime and forage mostly at night.","Distribution of breeding Ross Seals in heavy pack ice has prevented study of their social organization. During the nonbreeding season, they appear to be solitary and widely dispersed in northern reaches of the pack ice and even farther north in open waters of the Southern Ocean. During a 1999-2000 survey in East Antarctic in December—February, 112 of 115 definite or probable sightings of Ross Seals were solitary individuals; the remaining three sightings were of pairs. Immature seals may spend most of their lives at sea, returning briefly to pack-ice habitats to molt in summer.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Ross Seals are listed as “Specially Protected Species” in Appendix A of Annex II to the Environmental Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty, principally because of insufficient information to make a judgment about their population abundance and status. Commercial harvest of Ross Seals is also prohibited by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. Published global population estimates range from 20,000-50,000 individuals to 220,000 individuals. The most recent global estimate, based on analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the Antarctic continent between 1968 and 1983, provided an overall estimate of ¢.130,000 Ross Seals in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean. In a 1999-2000 survey of the East Antarctic in December—February, the regional population of Ross Seals was estimated at 41,300-55,900 individuals; however, 97-5 confidence intervals suggested the population could range from a low of 20,500 individuals to a high of 226,600 individuals, clearly reflecting the difficulty in surveying such a sparsely distributed and largely solitary species. Aside from possible changes to pack ice from climate change, conservation threats are believed to be limited because distribution of the Ross Seal occurs in areas of very low human activity and does not overlap with any commercial fisheries.","Ackley et al.

Ross Seal Ommatophoca rossu French: Phoque de Ross / German: Ross-Robbe / Spanish: Foca de Ross Other common names: Bigeyed Seal , Ross's Seal , Singing Seal Taxonomy. Ommatophoca rossi Gray, 1844 , “Antarctic ocean.” Restricted by G. E. H. Barrett-Hamilton in 1902 to “pack ice, north of Ross Sea 68°S, 176°E.” This species is monotypic. Distribution. Circumpolar in the Southern Ocean. Descriptive notes. Total length 170-210 cm (males) and 190-250 cm (females); weight 129-216 kg (males) and 159-201 kg (females). Newborns are 105-120 cm in length and weigh 17-27 kg. Ross Seals have relatively small but robust bodies with short, broad heads. Eyes are noticeably large and forward pointing, reflecting adaptations to their deep diving and foraging habits. Teeth are all small, and post-canines are simple without shearing or grinding structure. Canine teeth are very sharply conical, apparent adaptations for catching squid that seem to be their primary prey. Short pelage is dark brown dorsally and cream or tan ventrally, with several dark stripes radiating down throat from mouth and some spotting along boundary between counter-shaded, dorsal-ventral pattern. Ross Seals molt in late December—January and perhaps into mid-February. Habitat. Confined to the Southern Ocean and sparsely distributed around the Antarctic Continent. In late autumn and early summer, breeding Ross Seals are distributed in heavily consolidated pack ice in the Ross, Amundsen, and Bellingshausen seas of West Antarctica and scattered around East Antarctica and perhaps in the western Weddell Sea. From late summer through early autumn, Ross Seals appear to be pelagic, spending most of their time north of sea-ice habitats and foraging at relatively deep depths of 200-500 m or more. Most sightings of Ross Seals have been ofsolitary individuals, but small groups and aggregations have been seen a few times. Some of these aggregations and groups were recorded in areas of sparse ice and evidently reflected absence of suitable sites to haul-out. Vagrant Ross Seals have been observed at several subantarctic islands, New Zealand, and Australia. Food and Feeding. Ross Seals primarily eat deep-water squid and fish thatlive at depths of 100-500 m and occasionally krill when they are near sea surface. Based on stomach content analysis, their diet is ¢.47% squid, ¢.34% fish, and ¢.19% invertebrates. Breeding. Very little is known about breeding biology of Ross Seals. Age at sexual maturity is thought to be 3-4 years for females and 2-7 years for males. The few observations on reproductive biology of Ross Seals suggest that offspring are born in mid-October-November. Mating may occurjust after that in December and early January. Ross Seals make two kinds of low-frequency (100-1000 Hz) vocalizations out of the water: an explosive exhalation noise, with mouth slightly open, and a chugging, siren noise from the throat and pharynx, with rising and lowering frequencies and apparently with mouth and nostrils closed. Underwater pulse and siren calls of Ross Seals are similar to in-air calls, but their frequencies are higher (1-4 KHz) and are consistently pulse modulated at c.650/s with two independently varying tones—similar to the Walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ). These sounds might be used during aggressive intraspecific interactions and perhaps breeding displays. Ross Seals can live to 20 years, but c.12 years is probably typical. Activity patterns. Ross Seals forage at depths of ¢.100-200 m and occasionally as deep as 500 m or more during continuous diving for 4-8 minutes/dive. When Ross Seals are in areas of ice in spring and summer, they haul-out during the daytime and forage mostly at night. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Distribution of breeding Ross Seals in heavy pack ice has prevented study of their social organization. During the nonbreeding season, they appear to be solitary and widely dispersed in northern reaches of the pack ice and even farther north in open waters of the Southern Ocean. During a 1999-2000 survey in East Antarctic in December—February, 112 of 115 definite or probable sightings of Ross Seals were solitary individuals; the remaining three sightings were of pairs. Immature seals may spend most of their lives at sea, returning briefly to pack-ice habitats to molt in summer. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Ross Seals are listed as “Specially Protected Species” in Appendix A of Annex II to the Environmental Protocol of the Antarctic Treaty, principally because of insufficient information to make a judgment about their population abundance and status. Commercial harvest of Ross Seals is also prohibited by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. Published global population estimates range from 20,000-50,000 individuals to 220,000 individuals. The most recent global estimate, based on analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the Antarctic continent between 1968 and 1983, provided an overall estimate of ¢.130,000 Ross Seals in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean. In a 1999-2000 survey of the East Antarctic in December—February, the regional population of Ross Seals was estimated at 41,300-55,900 individuals; however, 97-5 confidence intervals suggested the population could range from a low of 20,500 individuals to a high of 226,600 individuals, clearly reflecting the difficulty in surveying such a sparsely distributed and largely solitary species.

Nevertheless, whaling records suggest a distinct size difference in the Southern Hemisphere and the Northern Hemisphere, with individuals from the Antarctic region typically larger than those from the North Atlantic Ocean. Two subspecies recognized.","B.b.borealisLesson,1828—oceansoftheNorthernHemisphere. B. b. schlegelii Flower, 1865 — oceans of the Southern Hemisphere.","Total length 1700-2000 cm; weight 22,000-38,000 kg. Total body length and weight estimates are 2000 cm and 38,000 kg in Antarctic waters, 1800 cm and 28,000 kg in the North Pacific Ocean, and 1700 cm and 22,000 kg in the North Atlantic Ocean. Adult female Sei Whales are slightly larger than males. Only an adult Blue Whale ( B. musculus ) and adult Fin Whale ( B. physalus ) are larger than an adult Sei Whale. The Sei Whale somewhat resembles a small-scale Fin Whale, although there are important differences. An adult Sei Whale generally is dark steel-gray on back, with bluish shade extending down flanks of body. In older individuals, there are lighter colored, gray-to-white, oval scars on body representing healed pits or bites caused by ectoparasitic copepods (Pennella spp.), lampreys (Petromyzon sp.), or cookiecutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis). Ventral surface is slightly lighter than back with an irregular, grayish-white patch of variable size near ventral groove blubber. Undersides of pectoral flippers and caudal flukes generally are the same color as back, or slightly lighter. Lower lips are a uniform gray and lack coloration asymmetry of Fin Whales that have a gray left lip and a distinctly white right lip. Head ofthe Sei Whale is 21-25% of total body length. Dorsal surface of head is marked by a single, prominent, median rostral ridge that extends from blowholesto tip of snout. Forms in the Bryde’s Whale ( B. edeni ) complex—the nominate form and the “ brydei ” form—also have prominent median dorsal rostral ridges, but they have two additional and shorter, auxiliary rostral ridges, one on either side of median ridge. From above, lateral margins of rostrum of the Sei Whale are slightly convex, and thusits rostrum is intermediate in shape between the broadly U-shaped rostrum of the Blue Whale and the more sharply pointed rostrum of the Fin Whale. In lateral view, rostrum of the Sei Whale has a slight dorsally arched profile, especially prominent on anterior 25% of rostrum. This dorsal arching is reminiscent of the condition in balaenid and eschrichtiid mysticetes and is perhaps functionally related to the fact that the Sei Whale is known to practice a form of skim or ram feeding to supplement its normal rorqual-style lunge feeding. Dorsalfin of the Sei Whale is relatively tall (25-60 cm), strongly falcate in shape with a broadly convex dorsal margin and is positioned on the back slightly less than two-thirds the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Pectoralflipperis relatively small and slender, with a distinctly pointed apex, and measures ¢.9% of total body length. As with all species of rorquals, there are only four elongate digits in the flipper (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes of the Sei Whale are also relatively small (compared with the Fin Whale), width measuring only ¢.25% of total body length. Deep, median notches mark relatively straight, trailing edges of flukes. Ventral groove blubberis rather distinct and typically marked by 38-62 relatively short grooves that terminate well anterior to umbilicus, approximately midway between flippers and umbilicus. In most rorquals (except the Common Minke Whale, B. acutorostrata , and the Antarctic Minke Whale, B. bonaerensis ), ventral grooves extend to and often beyond umbilicus. Baleen apparatus of the Sei Whale consists of individual laminae that are relatively longer and narrower than in other rorquals, with an average length-to-width ratio typically greater than 2-2:1. Baleen laminae are also oriented more vertically in the mouth, in contrast to the more ventro-laterally oriented baleen laminae of other species of rorquals. Largest main baleen plates of the Sei Whale are ¢.80 cm in length. Individual plates also show less cross-sectional curvature and are more anteroposteriorly flattened. Fringing baleen bristles are distinctly finer (c.0-1 mm in diameter) than in other species of rorquals. In these features of general shape, vertical orientation, transverse curvature, and bristle diameter, baleen laminae of the Sei Whale can be thought of as intermediate between those of balaenids and other species of rorquals. This morphological similarity may be the result of evolutionary convergence because Sei Whales are the only rorquals known to practice a form of skim feeding. Baleen of the Sei Whale is generally dark gray and often has a yellowishbrown hue expressed as diffuse longitudinal streaks. Some anterior laminae show a pale whitish hue, but there is no marked asymmetry in baleen coloration as occurs in Fin Whales, Omura’s Whales ( B. omurai ), and Antarctic Minke Whales. Baleen laminae of the Sei Whale generally number ¢.350 laminae/side or rack, but there can be 219-402 laminae. The Sei Whale is the swiftest of the rorquals and is known to reach top swimming speeds of 55 km/h for short periods. At sea, blowhole and prominent dorsal fin are often visible at the same time when an individualis surfacing. Blow is tall and columnar to bushy and generally up to 3-4 m high. When diving, the Sei Whale rarely raisesits tail flukes above the water or arches its back;it tends to sink en masse as it descends below the ocean surface. The Sei Whale rarely, if ever, breaches.","General preference for temperate waters, not venturing far into high polar seas. The Sei Whale has a cosmopolitan geographical distribution like most species of rorquals and is found in all ocean basins. Knowledge about habitat preferences of the Sei Whale is more limited than for many other species of rorquals, largely due to its more pelagic nature and irregular migration patterns compared with more inshore species that seasonally frequent continental shelf regions of the world’s oceans. Numerous reports comment on the occurrence of Sei Whales in waters coincident with the shelfsslope break. Studies of critical rorqual habitat in the eastern North Pacific Ocean found a correlation of distribution of Sei Whales with the shelfslope break and also with more offshore areas characterized by complex submarine topography associated with seamounts. In this region, prey abundance was apparently driven by oceanographic conditions that both increase primary productivity (greater nutrient supply) and concentrate zooplankton (fronts, eddies, and gyres).","Like all species of rorquals, the Sei Whale is a lunge filter feeder, feeding on dense concentrations of planktonic and nektonic animals, although seeming to prefer copepods and krill. It also uses a type of skim-feeding behavior in waters where prey densities are lower, especially when on winter breeding and birthing grounds. Skim feeding is the typical feeding strategy of the Bowhead Whale ( Balaena mysticetus) and right whales ( Eubalaena spp. ) and involves a variety of skeletal and soft anatomical adaptations, some of which occur in a rudimentary form in the Sei Whale—perhaps as a result of convergent evolution. These convergent features include a slightly, dorsally arched and attenuated rostrum; a relatively tall lower lip; and relatively narrow baleen laminae characterized by very fine baleen bristles. Perhaps because of their ability to perform both lunge and skim feeding, Sei Whales have a rather diverse diet for a rorqual, and although tending to prefer copepods, they are known to consume krill, amphipods, pelagic decapods, cephalopods, and even schooling fish. The few studies available on diets of Sei Whales suggest that they are essentially stenophagous during a given feeding period consuming, for example, only copepods at one time and krill at another time. These studies are largely based on whaling records, wherein stomach contents of butchered whales were analyzed and found to contain monospecific prey concentrations. In the North Atlantic Ocean, Sei Whales are reported to prefer pelagic crustaceans, especially copepods (Calanus sp.) in the late stage of their molting cycle when caloric contentis highest. In the Norwegian Sea, seasonal waxing and waning of copepod abundance seems to be a biological driver of abundance of Sei Whales in these waters, with copepod concentrations growing rapidly in March-April, reaching a maximum in May, followed by a brief decline in early summer and another increase in late summer, before a sharp decline in the late autumn and winter. In waters around Greenland, feeding Sei Whales primarily consumekrill (Meganyctiphanes spp. and Thysanoessa spp.), although schooling fish like sand lance (Ammaodytes tobianus), lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), and capelin (Mallotus villosus) are also eaten. Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean also seem to prefer copepods (Calanus sp.), especially in waters around northern Japan, but they also feed on various species of krill (Fuphausia spp. and Thysannoessa spp.). Schooling fish also make up an important part of the diet of the Sei Whale in the Pacific Ocean and include anchovy (Engraulis spp.), sardines (Sardinops spp.), pollock (Theragra spp.), and capelin. Sei Whales appear to feed most actively between dusk and dawn, corresponding with diel vertical movement of prey species to near surface waters at night. Perhaps related to this is the observation that Sei Whales generally do not dive as deeply as other species of rorquals. Thus, modified skim-feeding behavior may represent an adaptation for feeding on prey that is less densely concentrated in the water column at night than during the day. Some studies suggest that prey preference of Sei Whales may be dependent on ocean-basin topography, such as high relief areas like seamounts where upwelling of nutrient-rich waters results in phytoplankton blooms that are later followed by mass spawning of zooplankton. Related to this is the observation that summer feeding grounds of Sei Whales seem to occur in areas associated with oceanic frontal systems (fronts, eddies, and upwelling systems). No accounts of cooperatively feeding Sei Whales have been reported.","Information about reproduction of the Sei Whale is limited and primarily comes from whaling postmortem records, which suggest that females reach sexual maturity at an average age of eight years and typically a body length of 1310-1340 cm. Males appearto be sexually mature at the same age but at slightly smaller body lengths of 1200-1270 cm. Comparisons of reproductive status taken during years of heavy commercial exploitation (1930s through 1970s) suggests that age of sexual maturity has declined from c.11 years before 1935 to c.10 years by 1945, falling to modern levels by the 1970s. There is little detailed information on composition of breeding groups, although some data suggest that males dominate group structure on breeding grounds. Conception occurs in respective austral and boreal winters, with a peak in June-July in the Southern Hemisphere and in November—December in the Northern Hemisphere. Gestation is 10-11 months, with a single young born in respective austral and boreal winters. Young are ¢.450 cm in length and weigh ¢.780 kg at birth. Young are weaned at 6-8 months on summer feeding grounds when they are ¢.900 cm in length. This suggests an average neonatal growth rate of c¢.2 cm/day. Births in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean occur in February—March prior to northward migration to summer feeding grounds. Females reportedly reproduce on a two-year or even three-year cycle, suggesting an interbirth interval period of c.14-3 months. Sex ratio of neonates is essentially 1:1, and this probably holds for much of the year except for periods when differential segregation of sexes or sexual classes occurs on or at the ends of seasonal migrations. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs taken from external ear canals of dead Sei Whales suggest that they live up to 60 years.","Limited information exists concerning daily activity patterns of Sei Whales. Acoustic studies, however, conducted in the Gulf of Maine in the western North Atlantic Ocean suggest a correlation between diurnal movements of copepods and rates of vocalization and feeding activity of Sei Whales. Nocturnal movement of copepods to near the sea surface was associated with decreased rates of vocalization in Sei Whales feeding at the same depth. Conversely, during the day when copepods had migrated into deeper water, vocalization of Sei Whales increased possibly due to increased social interactions and greater difficulty in locating prey. Like all species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Sei Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding, birthing, and nursery grounds.","Because of anti-tropical distribution and out-of-phase seasonal migration patterns of Sei Whales, northern and southern populations are seldom, if ever, sympatric. Complete allopatry would eliminate gene flow between the two regions, thus lending support to the recognition of separate northern and southern subspecies. Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean are distributed mainly north of 40° N during boreal summer, extending into the Gulf of Alaska and even the Bering Sea. During boreal winter in the North Pacific Ocean, Sei Whales are more widely dispersed, with some individuals known to winter in subtropical waters off the Bonin Islands (27° N) in the west and as far south as the Revillagigedo Islands (18° N) in the east. Probably because of whaling related mortality, the majority of Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean occur today east of 180° W. During summer in the North Atlantic Ocean, Sei Whales typically occur north of 44° N in the west and up to 70° N in the east. Their winter distribution is poorly known, but it is reported to extend to ¢.28° N in the west (reports of Sei Whales in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico may represent misidentifications of Bryde’s Whales) and off Mauritania in the east. In the Southern Hemisphere, Sei Whales occur throughout the Southern Ocean during summer feeding season, generally between 40° S and 50° S. Austral winter distribution of Southern Sei Whales is poorly known and primarily based on whaling catch records, which reported Sei Whales off north-eastern Brazil (7°S) in the western South Atlantic Ocean and off Angola (8° S) in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean. During austral spring migration, Sei Whales tend to arrive on feeding grounds after Blue Whales and Fin Whales have already been there and typically do not forage as far south as the latter species, remaining well north of the Antarctic pack ice. It is unknown, however,if all Sei Whales in the Southern Hemisphere actually make a full southern migration; some individuals may remain in more temperate waters as year-round residents. The pole-ward summer migration of Sei Whales in both hemispheres typically begins with pregnant females leaving breeding and birthing groundsfirst, followed by the remaining adult whales and then immature individuals. Densities are not well known and vary with time of year and geographical location. During austral and boreal winters when Sei Whales are in warmer waters, groups can consist of 2-5 mature individuals dominated by males. In contrast, migrating whales are often solitary, except for mother—offspring pairs. Solitary whales also occur on feeding grounds, although large groups of 20-100 individuals have been reported. Social structure of large groups is not well known, and associations may simply be passive and a function of prey abundance rather than actual social interaction. Whaling records suggest a 1:1 sex ratio in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, while males seem to outnumber females by 6:4 in Antarctic waters. Based on limited genetic data and vocalization patterns, it is assumed that discrete populations of Sei Whale inhabit each ocean basin, except perhaps for the Southern Ocean where several populations may occur. Although Sei Whales are the least acoustically known, they vocalize, like all species of rorquals, at infrasonic frequencies mainly below 1 kHz. In the Southern Ocean, Sei Whales produce broadband sounds described as growls and “whooshes™ (100-600 Hz, 1-5 seconds in duration), as well as low frequency tonal (100-40 Hz, lasting 1 second) and down-sweep calls (39-21 Hz lasting 1-3 seconds). The latter calls often have multiple parts, with a frequency step in between. Calls of Sei Whales recorded in the western North Atlantic Ocean off Cape Cod, USA, consist of down-sweep sounds (82-34 Hz, lasting 1-4 seconds) and are made as a single call. This vocalization pattern might represent a contact call that allows dispersed individual Sei Whales to coordinate activities such as feeding or breeding. Acoustic studies in the Gulf of Maine found a correlation between diel movement of copepods, rate of Sei Whale vocalization, and feeding behavior. Vocalization rates were lower at night when Sei Whales were feeding close to the surface on copepods that had moved from deeper in the water column. Conversely, during the day when copepods had returned to deeper water and feeding was more difficult, Sei Whales vocalized possibly due to increased social activity.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Causes of population decline of the Sei Whale are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. Based on these data,it is estimated that the global population of mature individuals declined by ¢.80% in 1937-2007. Commercial whaling of the sleek and fast swimming Sei Whale did not begin until the advent of fast kill boats and explosive-tipped harpoons in the late 19"" century. Preference of Sei Whales for offshore, pelagic waters also contributed to the delay in its commercial exploitation. Whalers initially preferred to hunt and kill larger rorqual species like the Blue Whale and the Fin Whale and only turned to hunting the Sei Whale when stocks of the other species eventually were depleted. By the 1880s, however, whalers were successfully hunting Sei Whales in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, with more than 4000 whales reported killed in the Norwegian Sea and surrounding waters in 1885-1900. Hunting of Sei Whales began in Antarctic waters in the early 1900s and steadily increased until World War II. Between 1909 and 1938, it was estimated that 27,847 Sei Whales were killed worldwide. The majority of these whales were killed in northern ocean basins (12,909 individuals in the western North Pacific Ocean, 1019 individuals the eastern North Pacific Ocean, and 746 individuals in the North Atlantic Ocean), while just over 4500 individuals were killed in Antarctic waters. Commercial hunting of southern populations of Sei Whales, however, accelerated in the 1960s with more than 110,000 individuals killed in 1960-1970. Historical estimates of pre-whaling populations of Sei Whales suggested up to 42,000 individuals in the North Pacific Ocean and 60,000-65,000 individuals in the Southern Hemisphere. Pre-whaling population estimates of Sei Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean have not been calculated. Current population estimates suggest that Sei Whales have been largely extirpated from the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, while the population in the central North Atlantic Ocean may number as many as 10,300 individuals. No recent population estimates are available for Sei Whales in the western North Atlantic Ocean, although ship-based surveys in the late 1960s put the population at ¢.2080 individuals. Estimates of populations of Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean are also relatively low, with fewer than 8600 individuals estimated in 1974. This low number reflects conditions following an 11year period (1963-1974) of intense exploitation during which ¢.40,000 Sei Whales were killed. Although there are no estimates for populations of Sei Whales in the Southern Hemisphere more recent than 1979, most workers place the current population at 9800-12,000 individuals. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) established a moratorium on killing Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean in 1975. Similar moratoria were established in 1979 and 1986 for populations in the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic Ocean, respectively. Current threats to Sei Whales include ship strikes, entanglement in lost fishing gear (bycatch), and renewed whaling of North Pacific stocks (100 ind/year) by Japan under special “scientific permits.” Calculations based on estimates of natural mortality rates, age at first reproduction, and annual pregnancy rates suggest an average increase of only 2:7% /year for the global population of the Sei Whale.","Baumgartner & Fratantoni (2008) | Brodie & Vikingsson (2009) | Gambell (1985a) | Horwood (1987, 2009) | IWC (1977) | Prieto et al.

Balaenoptera borealis Lesson, 1828 , Germany, Schleswig-Holstein, Lubeck Bay, near Gromitz. The type specimen stranded in 1819 on the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, in the Baltic Sea; this skeleton was in the Museum fur Naturkunde, Berlin, but Allied bombing during World War II destroyed it. Genetic and morphological support for recognition of a southern subspecies of B. borealis is relatively weak. Nevertheless, whaling records suggest a distinct size difference in the Southern Hemisphere and the Northern Hemisphere, with individuals from the Antarctic region typically larger than those from the North Atlantic Ocean. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. B.b.borealisLesson,1828—oceansoftheNorthernHemisphere. B. b. schlegelii Flower, 1865 — oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. Descriptive notes. Total length 1700-2000 cm; weight 22,000-38,000 kg. Total body length and weight estimates are 2000 cm and 38,000 kg in Antarctic waters, 1800 cm and 28,000 kg in the North Pacific Ocean, and 1700 cm and 22,000 kg in the North Atlantic Ocean. Adult female Sei Whales are slightly larger than males. Only an adult Blue Whale ( B. musculus ) and adult Fin Whale ( B. physalus ) are larger than an adult Sei Whale. The Sei Whale somewhat resembles a small-scale Fin Whale, although there are important differences. An adult Sei Whale generally is dark steel-gray on back, with bluish shade extending down flanks of body. In older individuals, there are lighter colored, gray-to-white, oval scars on body representing healed pits or bites caused by ectoparasitic copepods (Pennella spp.), lampreys (Petromyzon sp.), or cookiecutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis). Ventral surface is slightly lighter than back with an irregular, grayish-white patch of variable size near ventral groove blubber. Undersides of pectoral flippers and caudal flukes generally are the same color as back, or slightly lighter. Lower lips are a uniform gray and lack coloration asymmetry of Fin Whales that have a gray left lip and a distinctly white right lip. Head ofthe Sei Whale is 21-25% of total body length. Dorsal surface of head is marked by a single, prominent, median rostral ridge that extends from blowholesto tip of snout. Forms in the Bryde’s Whale ( B. edeni ) complex—the nominate form and the “ brydei ” form—also have prominent median dorsal rostral ridges, but they have two additional and shorter, auxiliary rostral ridges, one on either side of median ridge. From above, lateral margins of rostrum of the Sei Whale are slightly convex, and thusits rostrum is intermediate in shape between the broadly U-shaped rostrum of the Blue Whale and the more sharply pointed rostrum of the Fin Whale. In lateral view, rostrum of the Sei Whale has a slight dorsally arched profile, especially prominent on anterior 25% of rostrum. This dorsal arching is reminiscent of the condition in balaenid and eschrichtiid mysticetes and is perhaps functionally related to the fact that the Sei Whale is known to practice a form of skim or ram feeding to supplement its normal rorqual-style lunge feeding. Dorsalfin of the Sei Whale is relatively tall (25-60 cm), strongly falcate in shape with a broadly convex dorsal margin and is positioned on the back slightly less than two-thirds the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Pectoralflipperis relatively small and slender, with a distinctly pointed apex, and measures ¢.9% of total body length. As with all species of rorquals, there are only four elongate digits in the flipper (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes of the Sei Whale are also relatively small (compared with the Fin Whale), width measuring only ¢.25% of total body length. Deep, median notches mark relatively straight, trailing edges of flukes. Ventral groove blubberis rather distinct and typically marked by 38-62 relatively short grooves that terminate well anterior to umbilicus, approximately midway between flippers and umbilicus. In most rorquals (except the Common Minke Whale, B. acutorostrata , and the Antarctic Minke Whale, B. bonaerensis ), ventral grooves extend to and often beyond umbilicus. Baleen apparatus of the Sei Whale consists of individual laminae that are relatively longer and narrower than in other rorquals, with an average length-to-width ratio typically greater than 2-2:1. Baleen laminae are also oriented more vertically in the mouth, in contrast to the more ventro-laterally oriented baleen laminae of other species of rorquals. Largest main baleen plates of the Sei Whale are ¢.80 cm in length. Individual plates also show less cross-sectional curvature and are more anteroposteriorly flattened. Fringing baleen bristles are distinctly finer (c.0-1 mm in diameter) than in other species of rorquals. In these features of general shape, vertical orientation, transverse curvature, and bristle diameter, baleen laminae of the Sei Whale can be thought of as intermediate between those of balaenids and other species of rorquals. This morphological similarity may be the result of evolutionary convergence because Sei Whales are the only rorquals known to practice a form of skim feeding. Baleen of the Sei Whale is generally dark gray and often has a yellowishbrown hue expressed as diffuse longitudinal streaks. Some anterior laminae show a pale whitish hue, but there is no marked asymmetry in baleen coloration as occurs in Fin Whales, Omura’s Whales ( B. omurai ), and Antarctic Minke Whales. Baleen laminae of the Sei Whale generally number ¢.350 laminae/side or rack, but there can be 219-402 laminae. The Sei Whale is the swiftest of the rorquals and is known to reach top swimming speeds of 55 km/h for short periods. At sea, blowhole and prominent dorsal fin are often visible at the same time when an individualis surfacing. Blow is tall and columnar to bushy and generally up to 3-4 m high. When diving, the Sei Whale rarely raisesits tail flukes above the water or arches its back;it tends to sink en masse as it descends below the ocean surface. The Sei Whale rarely, if ever, breaches. Habitat. General preference for temperate waters, not venturing far into high polar seas. The Sei Whale has a cosmopolitan geographical distribution like most species of rorquals and is found in all ocean basins. Knowledge about habitat preferences of the Sei Whale is more limited than for many other species of rorquals, largely due to its more pelagic nature and irregular migration patterns compared with more inshore species that seasonally frequent continental shelf regions of the world’s oceans. Numerous reports comment on the occurrence of Sei Whales in waters coincident with the shelfsslope break. Studies of critical rorqual habitat in the eastern North Pacific Ocean found a correlation of distribution of Sei Whales with the shelfslope break and also with more offshore areas characterized by complex submarine topography associated with seamounts. In this region, prey abundance was apparently driven by oceanographic conditions that both increase primary productivity (greater nutrient supply) and concentrate zooplankton (fronts, eddies, and gyres). Food and Feeding. Like all species of rorquals, the Sei Whale is a lunge filter feeder, feeding on dense concentrations of planktonic and nektonic animals, although seeming to prefer copepods and krill. It also uses a type of skim-feeding behavior in waters where prey densities are lower, especially when on winter breeding and birthing grounds. Skim feeding is the typical feeding strategy of the Bowhead Whale ( Balaena mysticetus) and right whales ( Eubalaena spp. ) and involves a variety of skeletal and soft anatomical adaptations, some of which occur in a rudimentary form in the Sei Whale—perhaps as a result of convergent evolution. These convergent features include a slightly, dorsally arched and attenuated rostrum; a relatively tall lower lip; and relatively narrow baleen laminae characterized by very fine baleen bristles. Perhaps because of their ability to perform both lunge and skim feeding, Sei Whales have a rather diverse diet for a rorqual, and although tending to prefer copepods, they are known to consume krill, amphipods, pelagic decapods, cephalopods, and even schooling fish. The few studies available on diets of Sei Whales suggest that they are essentially stenophagous during a given feeding period consuming, for example, only copepods at one time and krill at another time. These studies are largely based on whaling records, wherein stomach contents of butchered whales were analyzed and found to contain monospecific prey concentrations. In the North Atlantic Ocean, Sei Whales are reported to prefer pelagic crustaceans, especially copepods (Calanus sp.) in the late stage of their molting cycle when caloric contentis highest. In the Norwegian Sea, seasonal waxing and waning of copepod abundance seems to be a biological driver of abundance of Sei Whales in these waters, with copepod concentrations growing rapidly in March-April, reaching a maximum in May, followed by a brief decline in early summer and another increase in late summer, before a sharp decline in the late autumn and winter. In waters around Greenland, feeding Sei Whales primarily consumekrill (Meganyctiphanes spp. and Thysanoessa spp.), although schooling fish like sand lance (Ammaodytes tobianus), lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), and capelin (Mallotus villosus) are also eaten. Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean also seem to prefer copepods (Calanus sp.), especially in waters around northern Japan, but they also feed on various species of krill (Fuphausia spp. and Thysannoessa spp.). Schooling fish also make up an important part of the diet of the Sei Whale in the Pacific Ocean and include anchovy (Engraulis spp.), sardines (Sardinops spp.), pollock (Theragra spp.), and capelin. Sei Whales appear to feed most actively between dusk and dawn, corresponding with diel vertical movement of prey species to near surface waters at night. Perhaps related to this is the observation that Sei Whales generally do not dive as deeply as other species of rorquals. Thus, modified skim-feeding behavior may represent an adaptation for feeding on prey that is less densely concentrated in the water column at night than during the day. Some studies suggest that prey preference of Sei Whales may be dependent on ocean-basin topography, such as high relief areas like seamounts where upwelling of nutrient-rich waters results in phytoplankton blooms that are later followed by mass spawning of zooplankton. Related to this is the observation that summer feeding grounds of Sei Whales seem to occur in areas associated with oceanic frontal systems (fronts, eddies, and upwelling systems). No accounts of cooperatively feeding Sei Whales have been reported. Breeding. Information about reproduction of the Sei Whale is limited and primarily comes from whaling postmortem records, which suggest that females reach sexual maturity at an average age of eight years and typically a body length of 1310-1340 cm. Males appearto be sexually mature at the same age but at slightly smaller body lengths of 1200-1270 cm. Comparisons of reproductive status taken during years of heavy commercial exploitation (1930s through 1970s) suggests that age of sexual maturity has declined from c.11 years before 1935 to c.10 years by 1945, falling to modern levels by the 1970s. There is little detailed information on composition of breeding groups, although some data suggest that males dominate group structure on breeding grounds. Conception occurs in respective austral and boreal winters, with a peak in June-July in the Southern Hemisphere and in November—December in the Northern Hemisphere. Gestation is 10-11 months, with a single young born in respective austral and boreal winters. Young are ¢.450 cm in length and weigh ¢.780 kg at birth. Young are weaned at 6-8 months on summer feeding grounds when they are ¢.900 cm in length. This suggests an average neonatal growth rate of c¢.2 cm/day. Births in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean occur in February—March prior to northward migration to summer feeding grounds. Females reportedly reproduce on a two-year or even three-year cycle, suggesting an interbirth interval period of c.14-3 months. Sex ratio of neonates is essentially 1:1, and this probably holds for much of the year except for periods when differential segregation of sexes or sexual classes occurs on or at the ends of seasonal migrations. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs taken from external ear canals of dead Sei Whales suggest that they live up to 60 years. Activity patterns. Limited information exists concerning daily activity patterns of Sei Whales. Acoustic studies, however, conducted in the Gulf of Maine in the western North Atlantic Ocean suggest a correlation between diurnal movements of copepods and rates of vocalization and feeding activity of Sei Whales. Nocturnal movement of copepods to near the sea surface was associated with decreased rates of vocalization in Sei Whales feeding at the same depth. Conversely, during the day when copepods had migrated into deeper water, vocalization of Sei Whales increased possibly due to increased social interactions and greater difficulty in locating prey. Like all species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Sei Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding, birthing, and nursery grounds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Because of anti-tropical distribution and out-of-phase seasonal migration patterns of Sei Whales, northern and southern populations are seldom, if ever, sympatric. Complete allopatry would eliminate gene flow between the two regions, thus lending support to the recognition of separate northern and southern subspecies. Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean are distributed mainly north of 40° N during boreal summer, extending into the Gulf of Alaska and even the Bering Sea. During boreal winter in the North Pacific Ocean, Sei Whales are more widely dispersed, with some individuals known to winter in subtropical waters off the Bonin Islands (27° N) in the west and as far south as the Revillagigedo Islands (18° N) in the east. Probably because of whaling related mortality, the majority of Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean occur today east of 180° W. During summer in the North Atlantic Ocean, Sei Whales typically occur north of 44° N in the west and up to 70° N in the east. Their winter distribution is poorly known, but it is reported to extend to ¢.28° N in the west (reports of Sei Whales in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico may represent misidentifications of Bryde’s Whales) and off Mauritania in the east. In the Southern Hemisphere, Sei Whales occur throughout the Southern Ocean during summer feeding season, generally between 40° S and 50° S. Austral winter distribution of Southern Sei Whales is poorly known and primarily based on whaling catch records, which reported Sei Whales off north-eastern Brazil (7°S) in the western South Atlantic Ocean and off Angola (8° S) in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean. During austral spring migration, Sei Whales tend to arrive on feeding grounds after Blue Whales and Fin Whales have already been there and typically do not forage as far south as the latter species, remaining well north of the Antarctic pack ice. It is unknown, however,if all Sei Whales in the Southern Hemisphere actually make a full southern migration; some individuals may remain in more temperate waters as year-round residents. The pole-ward summer migration of Sei Whales in both hemispheres typically begins with pregnant females leaving breeding and birthing groundsfirst, followed by the remaining adult whales and then immature individuals. Densities are not well known and vary with time of year and geographical location. During austral and boreal winters when Sei Whales are in warmer waters, groups can consist of 2-5 mature individuals dominated by males. In contrast, migrating whales are often solitary, except for mother—offspring pairs. Solitary whales also occur on feeding grounds, although large groups of 20-100 individuals have been reported. Social structure of large groups is not well known, and associations may simply be passive and a function of prey abundance rather than actual social interaction. Whaling records suggest a 1:1 sex ratio in the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, while males seem to outnumber females by 6:4 in Antarctic waters. Based on limited genetic data and vocalization patterns, it is assumed that discrete populations of Sei Whale inhabit each ocean basin, except perhaps for the Southern Ocean where several populations may occur. Although Sei Whales are the least acoustically known, they vocalize, like all species of rorquals, at infrasonic frequencies mainly below 1 kHz. In the Southern Ocean, Sei Whales produce broadband sounds described as growls and “whooshes™ (100-600 Hz, 1-5 seconds in duration), as well as low frequency tonal (100-40 Hz, lasting 1 second) and down-sweep calls (39-21 Hz lasting 1-3 seconds). The latter calls often have multiple parts, with a frequency step in between. Calls of Sei Whales recorded in the western North Atlantic Ocean off Cape Cod, USA, consist of down-sweep sounds (82-34 Hz, lasting 1-4 seconds) and are made as a single call. This vocalization pattern might represent a contact call that allows dispersed individual Sei Whales to coordinate activities such as feeding or breeding. Acoustic studies in the Gulf of Maine found a correlation between diel movement of copepods, rate of Sei Whale vocalization, and feeding behavior. Vocalization rates were lower at night when Sei Whales were feeding close to the surface on copepods that had moved from deeper in the water column. Conversely, during the day when copepods had returned to deeper water and feeding was more difficult, Sei Whales vocalized possibly due to increased social activity. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Causes of population decline of the Sei Whale are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. Based on these data,it is estimated that the global population of mature individuals declined by ¢.80% in 1937-2007. Commercial whaling of the sleek and fast swimming Sei Whale did not begin until the advent of fast kill boats and explosive-tipped harpoons in the late 19"" century. Preference of Sei Whales for offshore, pelagic waters also contributed to the delay in its commercial exploitation. Whalers initially preferred to hunt and kill larger rorqual species like the Blue Whale and the Fin Whale and only turned to hunting the Sei Whale when stocks of the other species eventually were depleted. By the 1880s, however, whalers were successfully hunting Sei Whales in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, with more than 4000 whales reported killed in the Norwegian Sea and surrounding waters in 1885-1900. Hunting of Sei Whales began in Antarctic waters in the early 1900s and steadily increased until World War II. Between 1909 and 1938, it was estimated that 27,847 Sei Whales were killed worldwide. The majority of these whales were killed in northern ocean basins (12,909 individuals in the western North Pacific Ocean, 1019 individuals the eastern North Pacific Ocean, and 746 individuals in the North Atlantic Ocean), while just over 4500 individuals were killed in Antarctic waters. Commercial hunting of southern populations of Sei Whales, however, accelerated in the 1960s with more than 110,000 individuals killed in 1960-1970. Historical estimates of pre-whaling populations of Sei Whales suggested up to 42,000 individuals in the North Pacific Ocean and 60,000-65,000 individuals in the Southern Hemisphere. Pre-whaling population estimates of Sei Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean have not been calculated. Current population estimates suggest that Sei Whales have been largely extirpated from the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, while the population in the central North Atlantic Ocean may number as many as 10,300 individuals. No recent population estimates are available for Sei Whales in the western North Atlantic Ocean, although ship-based surveys in the late 1960s put the population at ¢.2080 individuals. Estimates of populations of Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean are also relatively low, with fewer than 8600 individuals estimated in 1974. This low number reflects conditions following an 11year period (1963-1974) of intense exploitation during which ¢.40,000 Sei Whales were killed. Although there are no estimates for populations of Sei Whales in the Southern Hemisphere more recent than 1979, most workers place the current population at 9800-12,000 individuals. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) established a moratorium on killing Sei Whales in the North Pacific Ocean in 1975. Similar moratoria were established in 1979 and 1986 for populations in the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic Ocean, respectively. Current threats to Sei Whales include ship strikes, entanglement in lost fishing gear (bycatch), and renewed whaling of North Pacific stocks (100 ind/year) by Japan under special “scientific permits.” Calculations based on estimates of natural mortality rates, age at first reproduction, and annual pregnancy rates suggest an average increase of only 2:7% /year for the global population of the Sei Whale.

In 1950, G. C. A. Junge proposed that the two whales represented the same species and considered B. brydei to be a junior synonym of B. edeni . Modern morphological and molecular evidence, however, suggests that there likely are at least two valid species in the Bryde’s Whale complex, a so-called “small-form” Bryde’s Whale ( edeni ) from Hong Kong, Australia, and south-western Japan and a so-called “ordinary” or “large” Bryde’s Whale ( brydei ) from pelagic waters of the western North Pacific Ocean and eastern Indian Ocean. A third taxon formerly lumped with the Bryde’s Whale complex as a so-called “pygmy” Bryde’s Whale from the Philippines was recognized in 2003 as a new rorqual species Omura’s Whale ( B. omurai ). Until more individuals of the ordinary and small-form Bryde’s Whale can be sampled and analyzed using both morphologic and molecular techniques, these taxonomic issues cannot be resolved. No subspecies are currently recognized, although broadly sympatric populations of resident inshore and migratory offshore Bryde’s Whale off South Africa may eventually prove to be distinct subspecies. Monotypic.","Tropical and warm temperate waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, generally between 40° N and 40° S.","Total length 1300-1450 cm; weight 15,000-16,600 kg (ordinary Bryde’s Whale); Total length 1050-1150 cm (small-form Bryde’s Whale). Whales of the Bryde’s Whale complex are medium-sized rorquals and were long confused with Sei Whales ( B. borealis ) in commercial whaling records because of morphological similarities. All members of the Bryde’s Whale complex, however, possess a distinctive morphological pattern of three rostral ridges consisting of a prominent median ridge running from blowhole to tip of rostrum, as in other rorquals, but complemented by shorter laterally placed auxiliary ridges, one right and one left. These laterally placed auxiliary ridges rise c.1-2 cm above adjacent rostral surface and are absent on other species of rorquals, including the Sei Whales. Whales in the Bryde’s Whale complex from the northern Indian Ocean (the type area of edeni ) are typically smaller (1100 cm) than those in the offshore waters of South Africa (the type area of brydei ) and elsewhere, which have greater mean total body lengths (1400-1500 cm). This dichotomy in body size has been reported in other ocean basins. Body coloration of Bryde’s Whale is generally dark bluish-black dorsally and white or yellowish ventrally, with a bluish gray area extending onto ventral groove blubber and flippers. The result is a rather diffuse counter-shading pattern, with a weakly differentiated boundary between dorsal and ventral surfaces. Flippers are bluish black, above and below. Several workers have noted a coloration dichotomy between pelagic Bryde’s Whales from the western North Pacific Ocean and offshore waters off South Africa and more neritic whales from coastal waters off South Africa and possibly south-western Japan. In the case of offshore whales, the body typically is heavily scarred with small oval pits from bites by cookie-cutter sharks (Isistius brasiliensis). This scarring pattern is especially concentrated over the posterior one-half of body and has been likened to the color and texture of galvanized iron. Such heavy scarring is typically absent from coastal Bryde’s Whales, which off South Africa bear thin scratches on ventral side of flukes and peduncle suggestive of direct encounters with shelf substrates. In both forms, lowerlips are typically a uniform color, although some individuals have asymmetric coloration of their throat and baleen apparatus. Head makes up 24-26% of body length, while slender and somewhat pointed flippers make up ¢.8-10% of body length and caudal flukes ¢.23-24% of body length. Dorsal fin is relatively large (up to 46 cm tall) and strongly falcate with a distinctly tapering tip;it is positioned relatively far back on body, slightly less than three-quarters the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Ventral groove blubber is marked by 54-56 longitudinal pleats, the longest of which extend from chin to, or beyond, umbilicus. In the Sei Whale, ventral grooves terminate well anterior to umbilicus. Baleen laminae of Bryde’s Whales number 285-350/side and typically are dark slate-gray with relatively thick grayish or brownish bristles. Researchers report some variation in shape of individual plates, noting that inshore individuals from waters off South Africa typically have plates that are more slender than those of offshore individuals. This morphological difference may correlate with different prey preferences. When swimming normally, Bryde’s Whales cruise at 2-7 km/h, but they are able to reach speeds of 20-25 km/h. At the surface, blow is columnar to bushy and up to 3-4 m high. Bryde’s Whales reportedly breach more often than most other species of rorquals.","Generally warm temperate to tropical waters, varying from neritic (shelf) habitats to pelagic habitats. Bryde’s Whale is rarely reported north of 40° N or south of 40° S. Some populations, such as the inshore Bryde’s Whale stock off South Africa (the “South Africa Inshore Stock”), prefer neritic (shelf) habitats within 30 km of the coast, while other populations, such as the “South-east Atlantic Stock,” prefer pelagic habitats in waters more than 80 km from the coast. There are limited data to suggest that a similar dichotomous pattern of inshore—offshore habitat preference holds for some populations of Bryde’s Whales in the Northern Hemisphere.","Bryde’s Whales are considered opportunistic feeders, switching their prey preference depending on prey availability, geographical location, season, and year. In the waters off South Africa, individuals of the South Africa Inshore Stock primarily feed on pelagic fish (Engraulis capensis, Trachurus trachurus, and Sardinops sagax ocellatus), while individuals of the South-east Atlantic Stock reportedly prefer krill (Euphausia lucens and E. recurva) but also eat mesopelagic fish (Mawrolicus mueller and Lestidium sp.). A study of the stomach contents of Bryde’s Whales from the Arabian Sea found mostly lantern fish ( Myctophidae ), spotted mackerel (Scomber australasicus), and horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.). Individuals in this more northern population appearto be genetically distinct from Bryde’s Whales occurring farther south off the southern coast of Madagascar. In December-March, these whales primarily feed on krill (Euphausia recurva and E. diomedeae). Seasonal variations of prey preference were recorded from the population of ordinary Bryde’s Whales in the western North Pacific Ocean where krill (E. pacifica) and pelagic schooling fish such as the Japanese anchovy (Engraulisjaponicus) are commonly consumed in May-June, the Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) in July-August, and krill again in September.","Information on reproduction of Bryde’s Whale is limited and based almost entirely on whaling postmortem records. Perhaps the most comprehensive data set comes from South Africa and suggests that females and males of the South-east Atlantic Stock reach sexual maturity at slightly less than seven years of age and c.1280-1370 cm. Length at sexual maturity for the inshore population (South Africa Inshore Stock) was smaller by ¢.60-91 cm. Seasonality of breeding in these populations, as suggested by data from slaughtered pregnant females, suggests almost year-round reproduction for the offshore population, with a peak in conceptions in March—May. Yearround reproduction was also suggested for the inshore population, but there were no obvious seasonal peaks. Data also reveal that inshore individuals had a much higher rate of ovulations per reproductive cycle. This degree of a non-seasonal, year-round breeding is unusual in a rorqual and has been proposed as possibly reflecting a major behavioral shift in this non-migrating, resident population, which is apparently able to exploit year-round availability of prey (pelagic fish) in the continental shelf waters of this region. In a sense, this inshore population of Bryde’s Whales may be behaving more like an “income” breeder than a “capital” breeder. Gestation in Bryde’s Whales last 11-12 months, with young ¢.400 cm in length at birth. Weaning occurs after ¢.6 months, when the young is 700 cm in length. In general, there is a 2year interbirth interval consisting of 11-12 months of gestation, six months of nursing, and a six-month anestrous period.","Little is known about daily activity patterns of Bryde’s Whales. Although it is clear that some populations undergo an annual, seasonal migration between low-latitude winter breeding and birthing grounds and mid-latitude summer feeding grounds,it is also clear that some populations are non-migratory, remaining year-round in high-productivity, mid-latitude settings.","Whales of the Bryde’s Whale complex are unique among species of rorquals in that they do not undergo long-distance annual migrations into high-latitude (above 50-60° N or S) summer feeding grounds. For those populations that do migrate, migrations never take individuals beyond temperate regions. For example, the South-east Atlantic Stock of Bryde’s Whale ranges only as far south as 34° S (Cape Agulhas) during austral summer where it feeds in offshore pelagic waters. In austral autumn, they travel north paralleling the west coast of Africa to winter breeding groundsin waters off Cameroon (3° S). In the western North Pacific Ocean, Bryde’s Whales range along the Pacific shores ofJapan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, extending from ¢.40° N in boreal summerto c¢.2° N in boreal winter. The central tropical Pacific Ocean hosts a distinct population of Bryde’s Whale, especially west of 150° W. Migration patterns of other populations of Bryde’s Whale are poorly known, although there are reports of non-migratory, resident populations in some regions. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, a resident population of Bryde’s Whale reportedly lives year-round in the Gulf of California. The distribution of Bryde’s Whale in the South Pacific Ocean is also widespread, occurring in a zone between the Equator and ¢.30° S and extending from the eastern coast of Australia across the central Pacific Ocean to ¢.120° W. The Indian Ocean is home to more than one population of Bryde’s Whale, including both “ordinary” and “small-form” types. Distribution of these whales extends from ¢.37° S to the northern shores of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. A population of Bryde’s Whales off the southern coast of Madagascar may or may not undergo a seasonal migration. Little is known about the social organization of Bryde’s Whales, and although they typically occuras solitary individuals, small groups of 2-3 whales have been reported.","CITES Appendix I. Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. The Data Deficient category for Bryde’s Whale is applied here because of uncertainty over taxonomic composition of the Bryde’s Whale complex. If it turns out that this taxon represents a single, polymorphic species, the category should be changed to Least Concern. If further genetic work, however, showsthis taxon to consist of two (or more) separate species and subspecies, the smaller populations may be considered threatened. Population decline documented for most other species of rorquals is difficult to determine for the Bryde’s Whale complex because prior to 1972, whaling statistics did not differentiate it from the Sei Whale. Nevertheless,it is clear from geographical locations and time of year data recorded for particular catches, that Bryde’s Whales suffered some degree of commercial overexploitation, especially in the western North Pacific Ocean and eastern South Atlantic Ocean. During the 1970s and into the 1980s, commercial harvesting of Bryde’s Whales increased, but it ceased after 1987 with the international moratorium on commercial whaling. Certain populations, such as the western North Pacific stock, are estimated to have experienced a 49% decline from 1911 to 1987. Current population estimates for the Bryde’s Whale complex are mostly old and of questionable accuracy, but they suggest that the cumulative global total from the eleven recognized stocks is at least 68,000 individuals. This figure may be meaningless given growing molecular evidence for recognition of separate species. Despite the moratorium on commercial whaling of rorquals, Japan resumed pelagic whaling of Bryde’s Whales in 2000 undera “scientific research” permit and has a quota of 50 ind/year. There also is a small artisanal fishery in the Philippines and Indonesia that kills Bryde’s Whales every year. Other threats include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), and habitat decline and pollution. Threats posed by climate change to this warm-water species complex are probably notas great as for more pagophilic species of rorquals.",Best (2001) | Cummings (1985a) | John et al.

Balaenoptera edeni Anderson, 1879 , Burma (= Myanmar), “found its way into the Thaybyoo Choung, which runs into the Gulf of Martaban between the Sittang and Beeling Rivers, about equidistant from each.” Balaenoptera edeni is currently considered to be a senior synonym of the B. brydei named by Olsen in 1913; the specimen that formed the basis for this southern species was captured in waters off South Africa by whalers operating from a shore station at Saldanha Bay, Cape Province.

Movements, Home range and Social organization. Whales of the Bryde’s Whale complex are unique among species of rorquals in that they do not undergo long-distance annual migrations into high-latitude (above 50-60° N or S) summer feeding grounds. For those populations that do migrate, migrations never take individuals beyond temperate regions. For example, the South-east Atlantic Stock of Bryde’s Whale ranges only as far south as 34° S (Cape Agulhas) during austral summer where it feeds in offshore pelagic waters. In austral autumn, they travel north paralleling the west coast of Africa to winter breeding groundsin waters off Cameroon (3° S). In the western North Pacific Ocean, Bryde’s Whales range along the Pacific shores ofJapan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, extending from ¢.40° N in boreal summerto c¢.2° N in boreal winter. The central tropical Pacific Ocean hosts a distinct population of Bryde’s Whale, especially west of 150° W. Migration patterns of other populations of Bryde’s Whale are poorly known, although there are reports of non-migratory, resident populations in some regions. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean, a resident population of Bryde’s Whale reportedly lives year-round in the Gulf of California. The distribution of Bryde’s Whale in the South Pacific Ocean is also widespread, occurring in a zone between the Equator and ¢.30° S and extending from the eastern coast of Australia across the central Pacific Ocean to ¢.120° W. The Indian Ocean is home to more than one population of Bryde’s Whale, including both “ordinary” and “small-form” types. Distribution of these whales extends from ¢.37° S to the northern shores of the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. A population of Bryde’s Whales off the southern coast of Madagascar may or may not undergo a seasonal migration. Little is known about the social organization of Bryde’s Whales, and although they typically occuras solitary individuals, small groups of 2-3 whales have been reported. Status and Conservation.

Monotypic.","Southern Hemisphere, from tropical waters (7° S) to the edge of and within pack ice (65° S) around the Antarctic continent. One record from off the coast of Suriname (4° N) in the Northern Hemisphere.","Total length 840-1020 cm; weight 6800-11,000 kg. Adult female Antarctic Minke Whales may be up to 100 cm longer than males. Mean lengths of sexually mature females and males are 900 cm and 840 cm, respectively. The Antarctic Minke Whale is the second smallest species of rorquals, after the Common Minke Whale ( B. acutorostrata ), and it has a dark-gray to black back and an almost all white ventral area. Along sides of body, back, and underbelly, colorations meet to form a diffuse, light-gray zone oftransition, generally with a diffuse boundary between gray and black. A dark thorax field separates discrete, light-gray lateral patches on anterior portion of thorax and posterior flank. Typically, there are two light-gray wavy streaks extending posterolaterally from near blowhole. The Antarctic Minke Whale has slim and pointed pectoralflippers that typically are solid gray, with white leading edges and lacking distinctive brilliant white pectoral band that characterizes Northern and Southern Hemisphere forms of the Common Minke Whale. Undersides offlippers and caudal flukes of the Antarctic Minke Whale are white with a dark-gray trim. Head is marked by a single, prominent, median rostral ridge that extends from blowhole to tip of snout. Like the head of the Common Minke Whale, the Antarctic Minke Whale has a narrowly triangular dorsal outline with a sharply pointed rostrum. In lateral view, head is relatively flat, with a straight (not arched) dorsal profile. Dorsal fin is relatively tall, typically falcate, and compared with larger species of rorquals,it is positioned more anteriorly and slightly less than two-thirds the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Pectoralflipper is relatively slender and lanceolate in shape, with a distinctly pointed apex, and is c.13% of total body length. As with all species of rorquals, there are only four elongate digits in the flipper (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes are also relatively small, with a width of only ¢.25% oftotal body length. Viewed from above, flukes are distinctly triangular with linear anterior and posterior margins. Median notch is variably developed but never deeply inset. Ventral groove blubberis marked by c.60-70 grooves,the longest of which terminate up to 30 cm anterior to umbilicus. In other species of rorquals (except the Sei Whale, B. borealis , and the Common Minke Whale), ventral grooves extend to and often beyond umbilicus. Baleen apparatus is very distinctive in its asymmetrical coloration pattern, in which plates on left side are yellowish-white only at the very front of rack, which is mostly composed of black plates. On the rightside, anterior one-third of plates is yellowish-white and posterior two-thirds of plates are black. This coloration is quite different from the symmetrical, uniformly white baleen coloration pattern seen in the Common Minke Whale. In general shape, baleen plates are relatively short and broad, with longest plates measuring 28-31 cm in length. Fringing baleen bristles are relatively coarse (c.0-3 mm in diameter) and intermediate in size between bristles of the Sei Whale and the Blue Whale ( B. musculus ). Baleen laminae generally number 260-360/side or rack. The Antarctic Minke Whale can cruise at speeds up to 20 km/h and is known to dive for up to 20 minutes at a time, although its dives typically last for just a few minutes. When swimming at sea, blowhole and large dorsalfin typically are visible together when an individual surfaces. Blow is low, generally 1-2 m high, and bushy.","Mainly pelagic and beyond the continental shelf break; shelf waters inshore of the shelf break, with or without sea ice, on summer feeding grounds. This small rorqual has a very broad distribution in the Southern Hemisphere, and although details of its migratory pattern are poorly known, it seems to follow a typical seasonal migration cycle from a high-latitude summer range to a low-latitude winter range. The Antarctic Minke Whale is perhaps the most pagophilic ofall species of rorquals, and helicopter surveys have reported them as far as 350 km south of the edge of the pack ice during austral summer. Some researchers suggest an evolutionary link between the slim, compact body and relatively small pectoral flippers of the Antarctic Minke Whale and its ability to invade narrow leads between ice floes. They further suggest that its narrowly pointed, stout rostrum facilitates breaking through newly formed sea ice to create breathing holes far from the pack-ice edge. These breathing holes are in turn used by other air-breathing marine predators (seals and penguins), which otherwise would likely not be able to live in pack ice. In this context, the Antarctic Minke Whale may function as a type of keystone species in the pack-ice ecosystem around Antarctica. .","Unlike the more euryphagous Common Minke Whale, adult Antarctic Minke Whales primarily consume Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) on summer feeding grounds, although smaller krill species (E. crystallorophias and E. spinifera) are also eaten. Amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudi) and occasionally perciform fish (Pleuragramma antarctica) have also been reported as prey species. Antarctic Minke Whales often lunge at the surface when feeding, but they also feed at depths generally shallower than those of other species of rorquals on Antarctic feeding grounds. There appears to be some ecological control of the diet of Antarctic Minke Whales, with Antarctic krill the primary prey species in offshore waters such as in the Weddell Sea and E. crystallorophias the primary prey species in coastal shelf waters such as the Ross Sea and Prydz Bay. Immature and mature male Antarctic Minke Whales reportedly spend up to 90 days on feeding grounds, while mature females spend up to 120 days feeding. From whaling postmortem statistics, it has been proposed that volume of krill consumed by a foraging Antarctic Minke Whale is 83.7-325.5 kg/day (c.2:7-4% of body weight) and that mean per capita krill consumption for the entire summer feeding season is 7500 kg and 16,400 kg for immature and mature males, respectively, and 12,500 kg and 39,100 kg for immature and mature females. This volume of built-up energy stores apparently is sufficient to sustain Antarctic Minke Whales through the austral winter because they appear to forage very little or not at all during this period. Reports of limited winter-feeding activity off South Africa suggest that even atthis time of year Antarctic Minke Whales are essentially stenophagous on krill.","Information about reproduction of the Antarctic Minke Whale is very limited and primarily comes from postmortem whaling records, which suggest that females reach sexual maturity at 7-8 years of age and males at c.8 years. Some evidence suggests that age of sexual maturity has been declining since the 1950s due to commercial exploitation. Antarctic Minke Whales in the South Atlantic Ocean are reportedly polygamous and have separate breeding and birthing areas—the former in waters off Brazil and the latter at higher latitudes (25-40° S). There is little information about composition of breeding groups, although some data suggest that males dominate group structure on breeding grounds. Mating occurs in the austral winter (June-December), with a peak in August-September. In the western South Atlantic Ocean, most sightings of Antarctic Minke Whales were of single individuals, although groups of one male and two females or two males and three or more females were also noted. Gestation usually lasts ¢.10 months, and birth peaks appear to occur during late May and earlyJune in waters north of the Antarctic Convergence. Typically, only one young is born, although twins and triplets have been reported. Young are ¢.280 cm in length and weigh 455 kg at birth. Young grow at a rate of c¢.1 cm/day while nursing and are weaned at 3-6 months on summer feeding grounds at ¢.570 cm in length. Weaned young may remain with their mothers for up to two years. Female Antarctic Minke Whales ovulate c.4 months after giving birth, suggesting a 14month birth interval. Pregnancy rates reportedly are ¢.90% for most ofthe year, indicating a rapid reproductive capacity of the Antarctic Minke Whale. It has been proposed that the extended mating season contributes to this near annual reproductive cycle. Nevertheless, whaling records for female Antarctic Minke Whales killed on winter breeding grounds off Durban, South Africa, suggest a lower reproductive rate closer to 78%. Mortality rate of young is unknown. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs taken from external ear canals of dead Antarctic Minke Whales suggest that they live up to 73 years.","There is limited information on daily activity patterns of Antarctic Minke Whales, but one study reported a diurnal feeding pattern, with feeding activity reaching a peak early in the morning before 05:00 h, with a possible second feeding episode in the late afternoon. Like other species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Antarctic Minke Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding, birthing, and nursery grounds.","The Antarctic Minke Whale essentially is a Southern Hemisphere endemic, with a single sighting reported from tropical waters in the western North Atlantic Ocean off Suriname (4° N). An additional Northern Hemisphere report is based solely on mtDNA and microsatellite DNA analyses of tissue samples collected from a whale captured during boreal summer in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean in the Arctic (70° 57° N), suggesting that rare vagrants may make it into boreal high-latitude waters. The Antarctic Minke Whale,iike other species of rorquals, has an annual migration cycle that includes traveling between high-latitude summer feeding grounds and low-latitude winter breeding, birthing, and nursery grounds. Some data indicate that individuals may overwinter in Antarctic waters. During austral summer, Antarctic Minke Whales typically occur in high numbers at 60-65° S and even as far as 70-75° S in Prydz Bay, the Ross Sea, and the Weddell Sea. During austral winter, most populations of Antarctic Minke Whales migrate north to poorly defined breeding grounds at middle latitudes (10-30° S) in the subtropical Pacific Ocean, off north-eastern and eastern Australia, off western South Africa, and off north-eastern Brazil. Analysis of whaling records suggests some degree of sexual segregation of Antarctic Minke Whales on austral summer feeding grounds, where mature males dominate populations early in winter before the arrival of mature females later in the season. Populations ofAntarctic Minke Whales occur south of 40° S in the austral summer; densities increase from November onward, peaking in January and declining in February. During austral winter when Antarctic Minke Whales are in warmer waters, groups can consist of 2-5 mature individuals with males predominating. In contrast, migrating individuals are often solitary, except for mother—offspring pairs. Antarctic Minke Whales have been reported off Durban, South Africa (29° 53’ S), from April to at least September, but they generally occur in June-December in the western South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil (7° S). Like most species of rorquals, Antarctic Minke Whales are not gregarious and tend to swim alone or in small groups of 2—4 individuals,although large feeding aggregations of up to 60 individuals may form in polar waters near the ice edge. Social structure of these larger groups is not well known, and associations may simply be passive and a function of prey abundance rather than actual social interaction. No accounts of cooperative feeding behavior have been reported for the Antarctic Minke Whale. Whaling records suggest an austral winter sex ratio of c.2:1 off of South Africa until about September,after which sex ratio may drop to 1-4:1.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The [UCN Red List. This IUCN classification is based on uncertainty surrounding the cause of an apparent 61% decline in populations of Antarctic Minke Whales in the Southern Ocean from an estimated 843,000-869,000 individuals in 1978-1991 to ¢.339,000 individuals in 1991-2004. If the decline turns out to be a sampling artifact or temporary, the Antarctic Minke Whale would be classified as Least Concern. If it is an actual decline, however, the ranking would be changed to Endangered. Antarctic Minke Whales in the Southern Ocean largely escaped intense commercial exploitation until the 1970s because of their small size and former abundance of larger species of rorqual like the Blue Whale, the Fin Whale ( B. physalus ), and the Sei Whale in these waters. Whaling records indicate that between the 1957-1958 season and cessation of commercial whaling at the close of the 1985-1986 season, ¢.98,000 Antarctic Minke Whales were killed on summer feeding grounds around Antarctica and 14,600 individuals on winter breeding grounds off Brazil. During this same period, an additional 1113 individuals were killed in waters off South Africa. Although protected from commercial exploitation by the international whaling moratorium, Antarctic Minke Whales continue to be hunted byJapanese under a “scientific permit” that allows ¢.935 ind/year to be killed. No information on population trends is currently available for the Antarctic Minke Whale. Besides continuation of “scientific research” kills of Antarctic Minke Whales by Japanese, other threats include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), pollution, habitat decline, and anthropogenic competition for resources. Possible effects of climate change on the extent and duration of pack ice are unknown, butit could pose a major threat to this pagophilic rorqual. Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) are a natural predator of Antarctic Minke Whales, which in at least one report are suggested to make up 85% of the diet of these apex marine predators.","Ainley et al.

Antarctic Minke Whale Balaenoptera bonaerensis French: Rorqual antarctique / German: Sudlicher Zwergwal / Spanish: Rorcual austral Other common names: Southern Minke Whale Taxonomy. Balaenoptera bonaerensis Burmeister, 1867 , near Belgrano, Prov. Buenos Aires, Argentina. The type specimen was found at the mouth of Riachuelo Medrano, on the western shore of La Plata Estuary, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Until the 1990s, B. bonaerensis was considered to represent a large-bodied Southern Hemisphere subspecies of B. acutorostrata . Monotypic. Distribution. Southern Hemisphere, from tropical waters (7° S) to the edge of and within pack ice (65° S) around the Antarctic continent. One record from off the coast of Suriname (4° N) in the Northern Hemisphere. Descriptive notes. Total length 840-1020 cm; weight 6800-11,000 kg. Adult female Antarctic Minke Whales may be up to 100 cm longer than males. Mean lengths of sexually mature females and males are 900 cm and 840 cm, respectively. The Antarctic Minke Whale is the second smallest species of rorquals, after the Common Minke Whale ( B. acutorostrata ), and it has a dark-gray to black back and an almost all white ventral area. Along sides of body, back, and underbelly, colorations meet to form a diffuse, light-gray zone oftransition, generally with a diffuse boundary between gray and black. A dark thorax field separates discrete, light-gray lateral patches on anterior portion of thorax and posterior flank. Typically, there are two light-gray wavy streaks extending posterolaterally from near blowhole. The Antarctic Minke Whale has slim and pointed pectoralflippers that typically are solid gray, with white leading edges and lacking distinctive brilliant white pectoral band that characterizes Northern and Southern Hemisphere forms of the Common Minke Whale. Undersides offlippers and caudal flukes of the Antarctic Minke Whale are white with a dark-gray trim. Head is marked by a single, prominent, median rostral ridge that extends from blowhole to tip of snout. Like the head of the Common Minke Whale, the Antarctic Minke Whale has a narrowly triangular dorsal outline with a sharply pointed rostrum. In lateral view, head is relatively flat, with a straight (not arched) dorsal profile. Dorsal fin is relatively tall, typically falcate, and compared with larger species of rorquals,it is positioned more anteriorly and slightly less than two-thirds the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Pectoralflipper is relatively slender and lanceolate in shape, with a distinctly pointed apex, and is c.13% of total body length. As with all species of rorquals, there are only four elongate digits in the flipper (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes are also relatively small, with a width of only ¢.25% oftotal body length. Viewed from above, flukes are distinctly triangular with linear anterior and posterior margins. Median notch is variably developed but never deeply inset. Ventral groove blubberis marked by c.60-70 grooves,the longest of which terminate up to 30 cm anterior to umbilicus. In other species of rorquals (except the Sei Whale, B. borealis , and the Common Minke Whale), ventral grooves extend to and often beyond umbilicus. Baleen apparatus is very distinctive in its asymmetrical coloration pattern, in which plates on left side are yellowish-white only at the very front of rack, which is mostly composed of black plates. On the rightside, anterior one-third of plates is yellowish-white and posterior two-thirds of plates are black. This coloration is quite different from the symmetrical, uniformly white baleen coloration pattern seen in the Common Minke Whale. In general shape, baleen plates are relatively short and broad, with longest plates measuring 28-31 cm in length. Fringing baleen bristles are relatively coarse (c.0-3 mm in diameter) and intermediate in size between bristles of the Sei Whale and the Blue Whale ( B. musculus ). Baleen laminae generally number 260-360/side or rack. The Antarctic Minke Whale can cruise at speeds up to 20 km/h and is known to dive for up to 20 minutes at a time, although its dives typically last for just a few minutes. When swimming at sea, blowhole and large dorsalfin typically are visible together when an individual surfaces. Blow is low, generally 1-2 m high, and bushy. Like the Common Minke Whale, sharply defined dorsal and ventral keels mark the caudal peduncle area of the Antarctic Minke Whale Habitat.

Although distinct populations of Minke whales are known to occur in different ocean basins, only a single, cosmopolitan species was officially recognized until the 1990s. A taxonomic review in 1998 concluded that the population of larger-bodied B. acutorostrata in the high latitude regions of the Southern Ocean should be separated based on genetic and morphological grounds and assigned to a different species, B. bonaerensis . This species is distinctly larger than B. acutorostrata and generally sympatric with an unnamed form in the Southern Hemisphere, generally called the dwarf Minke whale. Two subspecies recognized.","B.a.acutorostrataLacépede,1804—NAtlanticOcean. B. a. scammoni Demére, 1986 — N Pacific Ocean. An unnamed form is found in the Southern Hemisphere.","Total length 650-880 cm; weight 2000-2700 kg. Adult female Common Minke Whales are slightly larger than adult males. Total body length at physical maturity varies between ocean basins: 850 cm (females) and 790 cm (males) in the North Pacific Ocean; 850-880 cm (females) and 780-820 cm (males) in the North Atlantic Ocean; and 700 cm (females) and 650 cm (males) in the Southern Ocean. Coloration is also quite variable; populations of the unnamed southern form display the most complex body-color pattern of any species of rorqual. The more general coloration of the Common Minke Whale consists of a bluish dark-gray back and ivorywhite ventral surface, with streaks or lobes of lighter transitional shading, including dark thorax and flank fields and light thorax and flank patches. Dark coloration extends onto lower lips, while white coloration extends onto underside of pectoral flipper and caudal flukes. Tips and trailing edges of flukes are trimmed in dark gray. Many populations of Common Minke Whales have a roughly symmetrical pair of prominent pale gray, posteriorly convex, arched streaks that extend from just above flippers to midline of back. The most distinctive marking of the Common Minke Whale is a brilliant white patch or diagonal band that extends across middle of dorsal surface of pectoral flipper. In populations of the unnamed southern form, this flipper patch even extends onto flanks as a broad, white shoulder patch; there are dark gray, right and left, throat patches that cross ventrally onto the throat region but do not meet at the midline. In this form, there may also be a light-gray nape streak that extends from just above eyes from one side to the other, while near blowholes a pair of lightgray blowhole streaks curves posteriorly and to the left. Head of the Common Minke Whale is 22-23% oftotal body length and is marked dorsally by a single, very prominent median rostral ridge extending from blowholes to tip of snout. Lateral margins of rostrum, viewed from above, are straight and together form a narrowly triangular and pointed head—as in the slightly larger, Antarctic Minke Whale ( B. bonaerensis ). As in nearly all species of rorquals, lateral profile of head of the Common Minke Whale is relatively flat and not arched. Dorsalfin is relatively large, typically falcate in shape and positioned on back slightly less than two-thirds the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Pectoral flipper is relatively small and slender, with a distinctly pointed apex, and measures c.12% of total body length. As with all species of rorquals, flipper is composed of only four elongate digits (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes are also relatively small (compared with Fin Whales, B. physalus ), with width measuring only ¢.23-28% of total body length. Relatively curvilinear trailing edge of flukes lacks deep median notch. Ventral groove blubber is marked by 50-70 grooves, the longest of which terminate just anterior to umbilicus. In most rorquals (except of the Sei Whale, B. borealis , and the Antarctic Minke Whale), ventral throat grooves extend to and often beyond umbilicus. Baleen apparatus of the Common Minke Whale consists of relatively short and broad main plates, with an average length-to-width ratio typically greater than 3-3:1. Largest main baleen plates are only ¢.21 cm in length. Individual plates have slightly sinuous, cross-sectional shapes and relatively coarse bristles (¢.0-3 mm in diameter). Northern subspecies of the Common Minke Whale have baleen that is generally yellowish white in color, while baleen in the unnamed southern form appears dark gray or brown posteriorly due to dark fringing bristles. This coloration pattern is quite different from asymmetrical coloration pattern of baleen apparatus of the Antarctic Minke Whale. There are generally 230-290 baleen laminae/side or rack in the “North Pacific Minke Whale” (B. a. scammoni) and 270-325 baleen laminae/side in the “North Atlantic Minke Whale” (B. a. acutorostrata ). The Common Minke Whale is not the swiftest rorqual, with normal swimming speeds of 5-25 km/h and short bursts of up to 38 km/h. When an individual whale is surfacing at sea, blowhole and prominent dorsal fin are often visible at the same time. Blow is low (1-2 m high), bushy, and rather inconspicuous. When diving, the Common Minke Whale typically archesits tailstock (caudal peduncle) high but rarely raises tail flukes above the water. Prominent dorsal and ventral keels characterize caudal peduncle region. The Common Minke Whaleis known to breach more often than any other species of rorquals and performs full body breaches that end in either smooth reentries or spectacular splashes.","Cosmopolitan oceanic distribution and found in all ocean basins in varying numbers. Migratory patterns of the Common Minke Whale are rather poorly known, and consequently its habitat preferences, especially on breeding and birthing grounds, are only generally defined. Habitat preference related to feeding grounds, however, is better understood, and numerous studies suggest that Common Minke Whales occur more frequently in inshore coastal waters than other species of rorquals, and it is known to swim into bays,inlets, fjords, and even up larger rivers. This behavioris well demonstrated by Common Minke Whales that summer in the high-productivity waters of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the adjacent Saint Lawrence River, where individuals are seen foraging in relatively shallow water on various species of schooling fish. In the eastern Bering Sea, Common Minke Whales seem to prefer neritic environments of the middle and outer shelf and coastal habitats and fjords along the Alaskan Peninsula. Like the Antarctic Minke Whale, the Common Minke Whale is more pagophilic than most rorquals and is known to penetrate into ice floes and “polynyas” (open water surrounded by ice) in polar seas. Spy hopping is common when Common Minke Whales are in icy areas.","The Common Minke Whale is relatively euryphagous compared with other rorquals and is known to feed on a variety of prey species depending on location of feeding grounds, available prey, season, and year. At least one study has found that the relatively high metabolic needs of Common Minke Whales are matched by a diet that is focused on prey that has a generally higher caloric content than prey of other species of rorquals. This is reflected in their apparent preference for feeding at higher trophic levels on schooling fish rather than planktonic crustaceans. The Common Minke Whale is generally characterized as a surfaceor near-surface feeder, in contrast to the majority of other species of rorquals that forage at greater water depths. In the Barents Sea, north of Norway and Russia, Common Minke Whales primarily feed on schooling fish including Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). In years when these fish stocks collapse and spawning is well below normal, they switch to feeding almost exclusively on euphausid krill (7hysanoessa spp. and Meganyctiphanes norvegica). There are also some regional differencesin this system, with populations in the northern part of the Barents Sea switching to krill and those in the southern part feeding on a mixed-fish diet. Interestingly, there also seems to be a predator-prey linkage between planktivorous schooling fish (herring and capelin) and krill. When fish populations collapse, krill populations rebound, and Common Minke Whalesshift to feeding at a lower trophic level. In the Norwegian Sea, Common Minke Whales appear to feed in more pelagic habitats where they primarily consume sand eel ( Ammodytes spp. ), with lesser amounts of mackerel (Scomber spp.), herring (Clupea spp-), and Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarkii). In waters around Iceland, the diet of Common Minke Whales includes schooling fish (59%) and planktonic crustaceans (41%). One study has suggested that Common Minke Whales are a major predator of schooling fish in Icelandic waters, consuming more than one million tons annually. In the western North Atlantic Ocean, Common Minke Whales killed off Newfoundland were found to have been primarily eating capelin. In the North Pacific Ocean, prey preference of Common Minke Whales varies seasonally, with one study from the western North Pacific reporting that whales preferred Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) in May—June, Pacific saury (Cololabis saira) in July-August, and Pacific krill (Euphausia pacifica) in September. This study also found that Common Minke Whales avoided feeding on krill unless it was the only available prey. In other areas of the North Pacific Ocean, Common Minke Whales seasonally prefer schooling fish like sand lance ( Ammodytidae ) and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). In the Southern Ocean, the diet of the unnamed southern form is more restricted and reportedly consists of myctophid fish in the Antarctic and krill (E. similis) in other areas. When feeding, Common Minke Whales are known to practice a variety of specialized strategies, depending on location and available prey species. In waters of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Saint Lawrence River, they reportedly swim into rather restricted fjords where they appear to expend a significant amount of energy concentrating schooling fish near the water’s surface prior to a feeding strike. Taking advantage of the air-water interface as a barrierto fish attempting to flee, individual whales use various surface maneuvers that seem to effectively cause the fish prey to form temporary aggregations. Such maneuvers include “head slaps” where a whale slowly raisesits head out of the water and then quickly bringsits head downward to create a large splash and audible slap; “chin-up blow” where a whale vigorously raises its head above the water as it surfaces to breathe and then continues swimming as it submerges without making a splash; and “exhale-on-the-dive” where a whale forcefully exhales air just below the air—water interface to create a water-filled spout blast. These disparate behaviors seem to generate mechanical or percussive acoustic cues that stimulate an aggregation response in the prey just prior to a surface lunge feeding strike. Although the general foraging pattern is lunge feeding, some observers report seeing Common Minke Whalesalso practicing a form ofskim feeding reminiscent of the predominant feeding strategy of the Bowhead Whale ( Balaena mysticetus) and right whales ( Eubalaena spp. ).","Information about reproduction of the Common Minke Whale primarily comes from whaling records, which suggest that females reach sexual maturity at c.6 years of age and males at c.7 years. In the North Pacific Ocean, breeding occurs throughout the year, with peaks in January and June. An exception to this pattern has been documented for the reproductive cycle of resident Common Minke Whales in the inshore waters of the Sea of Japan, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea, where conceptions typically occur in October-November. In the North Atlantic Ocean, mating generally occurs in October—March. There is no reliable information on the composition of breeding groups. Gestation usually lasts c.10 months, and birth peaks occur in December andJune in the North Pacific Ocean and in November-March in the North Atlantic. Young are ¢.220 cm in length at birth and weigh ¢.350 kg. Typically only one young is born, but twins and triplets have been reported. Weaning occurs after 4-5 months when young have reached ¢.570 cm in length. Pregnancy rates of 87% and 97% have been reported for adult females in the western and eastern North Atlantic Ocean, respectively. This implies an annual reproductive cycle for mature female North Atlantic Minke Whales. Although little is known about the reproductive cycle of the unnamed form in the Southern Hemisphere, limited data suggests similar patterns to those of the northern subspecies. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs from external ear canals of dead individuals suggest that Common Minke Whaleslive up to 60 years. On following pages: 2. Antarctic Minke Whale ( Balaenoptera bonaerensis ); 3. Sei Whale ( Balaenoptera borealis ); 4. Bryde's Whale ( Balaenoptera eden).","There is no specific information for this species, but as with most species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of the Common Minke Whale are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding, birthing, and nursery grounds.","The Common Minke Whale has a cosmopolitan distribution and occurs in all ocean basins. Whaling mortality data suggests that, like all species of rorquals, most populations of the Common Minke Whale undergo an annual migration cycle from high-latitude feeding grounds to lowlatitude breeding and birthing grounds. Details of this migration pattern and especially locations of summer breeding grounds are poorly documented. In the North Pacific Ocean during summer, the Common Minke Whale ranges as far north as the Chukchi Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea and south to the East China Sea in the west and the coast of central Baja California in the east. There is some evidence that Common Minke Whales off California and Baja California (including the Gulf of California) form a year-round resident population. Summer range in the central Pacific Ocean extends to ¢.30° N, with rare reports around the Hawaiian Islands. Winter distribution of the Common Minke Whale in the North Pacific Ocean is largely unknown, and even concerted efforts by Japanese “scientific expeditions” failed to locate winter breeding grounds in the south-western region of this ocean basin. The fact that Common Minke Whales show a seasonal increase in numbers in the Yellow Sea serves as evidence that they do undergo an annual migration. In the North Atlantic Ocean during summer, the Common Minke Whale is widespread and occurs as far north as Baffin Bay and the Greenland Sea in the west and Svalbard and Franz Josef Land in the east. Winter distribution in the North Atlantic Ocean is poorly known, but it extends at least to the Caribbean in the west and the Straits of Gibraltar in the east. Common Minke Whales are considered visitors to the Mediterranean Sea. They occasionally have been reported in the waters off Western Sahara and Mauritania and more frequently in waters around the Canary Islands (29° N). The unnamed southern form in the Southern Hemisphere seems to be seasonally sympatric with the Antarctic Minke Whale. This is certainly the case on austral summer feeding grounds, although the unnamed southern form tends to remain north of 60° S, while the Antarctic Minke Whale ranges farther south to 65° S and higher latitudes. Austral winter range of the unnamed southern form reportedly extends at least to 11° S in the western South Pacific Ocean off Australia and to 2° S off Brazil in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean. Individuals of the unnamed southern form are frequently observed during this season in waters off South Africa where their distinctive morphology was first recognized and described. Some populations of this unnamed southern form appear to have more resident home ranges and are not highly migratory. The Common Minke Whale typically occurs singly or in small groups of 2-3 individuals. Larger groups have been reported, especially on summer feeding grounds. As with most species of rorquals, social structure of large groups is poorly known and likely the result of high prey densities rather than true social interaction. On these occasions, groups of Common Minke Whales may occur with other species of rorquals.","CITES Appendix I, except the West Greenland population listed in Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Although the global population of the Common Minke Whale is not known, the current estimate for stocks in the North Atlantic Ocean alone is ¢.182,000 individuals, including 80,487 individuals in the eastern North Atlantic, 95,943 individuals in the central North Atlantic, 3474 individuals in waters off West Greenland, and 4018 individuals along the east coasts of Canada and the USA. Given this population size, the Common Minke Whale does not meet the census thresholds for a threatened category. Nevertheless, certain populations in the North Pacific Ocean, like the so-called J-stock (Sea of Japan—Yellow Sea—East China Sea) and O-stock (Pacific waters and Sea of Okhotsk) have been subjected to intense overexploitation and are in decline and considered threatened. Active commercial whaling of Common Minke Whales did not begin in earnest until about the 1930s in the western North Pacific Ocean, the 1940s in the North Atlantic Ocean, and the 1950s in the Southern Hemisphere. This shift to increased hunting of Common Minke Whales was driven in large part by precipitous declines in populations of larger species of rorquals (the Blue Whale, the Fin Whale, and the Sei Whale). Whaling records document the killing of ¢.140,000 Common Minke Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean since the 1940s and another 29,000 in the eastern North Pacific (Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and East China Sea) over this same period. This level of commercial whaling ended in 1987 under the international moratorium on whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Nevertheless, commercial whaling by Norway resumed in 1993 under a formal objection to the moratorium. The current quota set by Norway is 1286 Common Minke Whales/year, although the actual number of whales killed in 2011 was 533. Iceland and Russia have filed similar objections, and Iceland resumed whaling of Common Minke Whales in 2006, with a national quota of 100 ind/year. Japan resumed killing Common Minke Whales in the North Pacific Ocean in 1994 under a “scientific research” permit that set an annual catch limit of 220 individuals in 2006. Aboriginal whaling off Greenland also has continued to kill Common Minke Whales from shore stations, with annual quotas of 178 ind/year and 12 ind/year set for West Greenland and East Greenland waters, respectively. Besides resumption of commercial whaling, other threats to Common Minke Whales include entanglementin fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (whale watching harassment), and habitat decline. Possible effects of climate change on the extent and duration of pack ice, and its effect on the distribution of the Common Minke Whale, are unknown.",Arnold et al. (2005) | Christiansen et al.

Although distinct populations of Minke whales are known to occur in different ocean basins, only a single, cosmopolitan species was officially recognized until the 1990s. A taxonomic review in 1998 concluded that the population of larger-bodied B. acutorostrata in the high latitude regions of the Southern Ocean should be separated based on genetic and morphological grounds and assigned to a different species, B. bonaerensis . This species is distinctly larger than B. acutorostrata and generally sympatric with an unnamed form in the Southern Hemisphere, generally called the dwarf Minke whale. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. B.a.acutorostrataLacépede,1804—NAtlanticOcean. B. a. scammoni Demére, 1986 — N Pacific Ocean. An unnamed form is found in the Southern Hemisphere. Descriptive notes. Total length 650-880 cm; weight 2000-2700 kg. Adult female Common Minke Whales are slightly larger than adult males. Total body length at physical maturity varies between ocean basins: 850 cm (females) and 790 cm (males) in the North Pacific Ocean; 850-880 cm (females) and 780-820 cm (males) in the North Atlantic Ocean; and 700 cm (females) and 650 cm (males) in the Southern Ocean. Coloration is also quite variable; populations of the unnamed southern form display the most complex body-color pattern of any species of rorqual. The more general coloration of the Common Minke Whale consists of a bluish dark-gray back and ivorywhite ventral surface, with streaks or lobes of lighter transitional shading, including dark thorax and flank fields and light thorax and flank patches. Dark coloration extends onto lower lips, while white coloration extends onto underside of pectoral flipper and caudal flukes. Tips and trailing edges of flukes are trimmed in dark gray. Many populations of Common Minke Whales have a roughly symmetrical pair of prominent pale gray, posteriorly convex, arched streaks that extend from just above flippers to midline of back. The most distinctive marking of the Common Minke Whale is a brilliant white patch or diagonal band that extends across middle of dorsal surface of pectoral flipper. In populations of the unnamed southern form, this flipper patch even extends onto flanks as a broad, white shoulder patch; there are dark gray, right and left, throat patches that cross ventrally onto the throat region but do not meet at the midline. In this form, there may also be a light-gray nape streak that extends from just above eyes from one side to the other, while near blowholes a pair of lightgray blowhole streaks curves posteriorly and to the left. Head of the Common Minke Whale is 22-23% oftotal body length and is marked dorsally by a single, very prominent median rostral ridge extending from blowholes to tip of snout. Lateral margins of rostrum, viewed from above, are straight and together form a narrowly triangular and pointed head—as in the slightly larger, Antarctic Minke Whale ( B. bonaerensis ). As in nearly all species of rorquals, lateral profile of head of the Common Minke Whale is relatively flat and not arched. Dorsalfin is relatively large, typically falcate in shape and positioned on back slightly less than two-thirds the distance from tip of rostrum to flukes. Pectoral flipper is relatively small and slender, with a distinctly pointed apex, and measures c.12% of total body length. As with all species of rorquals, flipper is composed of only four elongate digits (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes are also relatively small (compared with Fin Whales, B. physalus ), with width measuring only ¢.23-28% of total body length. Relatively curvilinear trailing edge of flukes lacks deep median notch. Ventral groove blubber is marked by 50-70 grooves, the longest of which terminate just anterior to umbilicus. In most rorquals (except of the Sei Whale, B. borealis , and the Antarctic Minke Whale), ventral throat grooves extend to and often beyond umbilicus. Baleen apparatus of the Common Minke Whale consists of relatively short and broad main plates, with an average length-to-width ratio typically greater than 3-3:1. Largest main baleen plates are only ¢.21 cm in length. Individual plates have slightly sinuous, cross-sectional shapes and relatively coarse bristles (¢.0-3 mm in diameter). Northern subspecies of the Common Minke Whale have baleen that is generally yellowish white in color, while baleen in the unnamed southern form appears dark gray or brown posteriorly due to dark fringing bristles. This coloration pattern is quite different from asymmetrical coloration pattern of baleen apparatus of the Antarctic Minke Whale. There are generally 230-290 baleen laminae/side or rack in the “North Pacific Minke Whale” (B. a. scammoni) and 270-325 baleen laminae/side in the “North Atlantic Minke Whale” (B. a. acutorostrata ). The Common Minke Whale is not the swiftest rorqual, with normal swimming speeds of 5-25 km/h and short bursts of up to 38 km/h. When an individual whale is surfacing at sea, blowhole and prominent dorsal fin are often visible at the same time. Blow is low (1-2 m high), bushy, and rather inconspicuous. When diving, the Common Minke Whale typically archesits tailstock (caudal peduncle) high but rarely raises tail flukes above the water. Prominent dorsal and ventral keels characterize caudal peduncle region. The Common Minke Whaleis known to breach more often than any other species of rorquals and performs full body breaches that end in either smooth reentries or spectacular splashes. Habitat. Cosmopolitan oceanic distribution and found in all ocean basins in varying numbers. Migratory patterns of the Common Minke Whale are rather poorly known, and consequently its habitat preferences, especially on breeding and birthing grounds, are only generally defined. Habitat preference related to feeding grounds, however, is better understood, and numerous studies suggest that Common Minke Whales occur more frequently in inshore coastal waters than other species of rorquals, and it is known to swim into bays,inlets, fjords, and even up larger rivers. This behavioris well demonstrated by Common Minke Whales that summer in the high-productivity waters of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the adjacent Saint Lawrence River, where individuals are seen foraging in relatively shallow water on various species of schooling fish. In the eastern Bering Sea, Common Minke Whales seem to prefer neritic environments of the middle and outer shelf and coastal habitats and fjords along the Alaskan Peninsula. Like the Antarctic Minke Whale, the Common Minke Whale is more pagophilic than most rorquals and is known to penetrate into ice floes and “polynyas” (open water surrounded by ice) in polar seas. Spy hopping is common when Common Minke Whales are in icy areas. Food and Feeding. The Common Minke Whale is relatively euryphagous compared with other rorquals and is known to feed on a variety of prey species depending on location of feeding grounds, available prey, season, and year.

There is no specific information for this species, but as with most species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of the Common Minke Whale are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding, birthing, and nursery grounds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Common Minke Whale has a cosmopolitan distribution and occurs in all ocean basins. Whaling mortality data suggests that, like all species of rorquals, most populations of the Common Minke Whale undergo an annual migration cycle from high-latitude feeding grounds to lowlatitude breeding and birthing grounds.

In the North Pacific Ocean during summer, the Common Minke Whale ranges as far north as the Chukchi Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea and south to the East China Sea in the west and the coast of central Baja California in the east. There is some evidence that Common Minke Whales off California and Baja California (including the Gulf of California) form a year-round resident population.

Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Although the global population of the Common Minke Whale is not known, the current estimate for stocks in the North Atlantic Ocean alone is ¢.182,000 individuals, including 80,487 individuals in the eastern North Atlantic, 95,943 individuals in the central North Atlantic, 3474 individuals in waters off West Greenland, and 4018 individuals along the east coasts of Canada and the USA. Given this population size, the Common Minke Whale does not meet the census thresholds for a threatened category. Nevertheless, certain populations in the North Pacific Ocean, like the so-called J-stock (Sea of Japan—Yellow Sea—East China Sea) and O-stock (Pacific waters and Sea of Okhotsk) have been subjected to intense overexploitation and are in decline and considered threatened. Active commercial whaling of Common Minke Whales did not begin in earnest until about the 1930s in the western North Pacific Ocean, the 1940s in the North Atlantic Ocean, and the 1950s in the Southern Hemisphere. This shift to increased hunting of Common Minke Whales was driven in large part by precipitous declines in populations of larger species of rorquals (the Blue Whale, the Fin Whale, and the Sei Whale). Whaling records document the killing of ¢.140,000 Common Minke Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean since the 1940s and another 29,000 in the eastern North Pacific (Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and East China Sea) over this same period. This level of commercial whaling ended in 1987 under the international moratorium on whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Nevertheless, commercial whaling by Norway resumed in 1993 under a formal objection to the moratorium. The current quota set by Norway is 1286 Common Minke Whales/year, although the actual number of whales killed in 2011 was 533. Iceland and Russia have filed similar objections, and Iceland resumed whaling of Common Minke Whales in 2006, with a national quota of 100 ind/year. Japan resumed killing Common Minke Whales in the North Pacific Ocean in 1994 under a “scientific research” permit that set an annual catch limit of 220 individuals in 2006. Aboriginal whaling off Greenland also has continued to kill Common Minke Whales from shore stations, with annual quotas of 178 ind/year and 12 ind/year set for West Greenland and East Greenland waters, respectively. Besides resumption of commercial whaling, other threats to Common Minke Whales include entanglementin fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (whale watching harassment), and habitat decline. Possible effects of climate change on the extent and duration of pack ice, and its effect on the distribution of the Common Minke Whale, are unknown. Bibliography. Arnold et al.

Total body length estimates are 2500 cm and 2700 cm for male and female “Southern Fin Whales” (B. b. quoyi ) and 2200 cm and 2400 cm for male and female “Northern Fin Whales” (B. b. physalus ). The Fin Whale is the most slender species of rorquals and is only exceeded in maximum body length by the Blue Whale ( B. musculus ). Color of adult Fin Whales is a uniform dark gray to brownish-black on back and sides, grading into white on belly. Undersides of pectoral flippers and caudal flukes are also white. Perhaps the most distinctive coloration feature of the Fin Whale is its asymmetric head coloration; left side of head including lower lip is uniformly dark gray like body, while right lower lip and right inside of mouth are white. White coloration can extend onto right upperlip and neck. The recently described Omura’s Whale ( B. omurai ) has a somewhat similar color asymmetry of head, although dark-gray pigmentation of left side of head extends past lower lip nearly to midline of throat, instead of typically covering only lower lip, as in Fin Whales. Fin Whales typically lack mottled coloration of Blue Whales and extensive scarring of Sei Whales ( B. borealis ). On Fin Whales, there is often a grayish white, chevron-shaped patch on upper back behind blowholes, with apex of chevron pointing forward. Head makes up ¢.20-25% of total body length. External surface of rostrum has a median ridge that extends from blowholes to tip of snout. Median ridge of Fin Whales is not as sharply defined as in Sei Whales or Bryde’s Whales ( B. edeni ). Viewed from above, rostrum of the Fin Whale has straight lateral margins, even more so than in Sei Whales. Like most species of rorquals, head of the Fin Whale is relatively flattened in lateral view. Dorsal fin is distinct, up to 60 cm tall, and positioned about three-quarters the distance from tip of rostrum to tail. Behind dorsal fin, peduncle is marked by distinct dorsal and ventral keel-like ridges, features that give Fin Whales their nickname of “razorback.” Tetradactyl (four-fingered) pectoral flippers of Fin Whales are relatively small and slender compared with pectoral flippers of Blue Whales and measure only 8-10% of total body length. Width of caudal flukes measures 20-24% of total body length and can be up to 500 cm across from tip-to-tip in a 2000cm individual. As with most species of rorquals, smooth trailing edge of caudal flukes is marked by a deep median notch. Ventral grove blubber has 50-100 pleats that extend from tip of rostrum to umbilicus and slightly beyond. Baleen apparatus reflects coloration asymmetry of rest of head, with entire left baleen rack and posterior two-thirds of right baleen rack composed of dark blue-gray baleen laminae with vertical streaks of white or yellow. In contrast, baleen laminae in front of right baleen rack are white or yellow. Fringing baleen bristles are generally yellowish white and somewhatfiner (averaging 0-35-0-4 mm in diameter) than coarse, black baleen bristles of Blue Whales. Baleen laminae are relatively broad, with average length-to-width ratio c.2:1. Largest main baleen plates are 70-90 cm in length. Number of baleen laminae varies widely, with Southern Fin Whales possessing an average of 356-365 laminae and Northern Fin Whales in the North Pacific Ocean averaging 360-390 laminae. Greatest number of laminae reported approaches 470/rack. Fin Whales are relatively fast swimmers and can reach speeds of 28 km/h for short periods. Normal cruising speed is 9-15 km/h. Fin Whales can forage at depths as great as 300 m, much deeper than foraging Blue Whales or Sei Whales. As a consequence, Fin Whales often rise to the surface at a steep angle, blow, submerge their massive heads, and then dive again with a distinctly arched back and well-exposed dorsal fin. While diving, they almost neverlift their caudal flukes above the water’s surface. A typical surface blow is cone-shaped and can reach up to 6 m. Fin Whales, unlike other large species of rorquals, occasionally breach and, when doing so, collide with the water surface with a tremendous splash.","Temperate and colder waters, with a cosmopolitan geographical distribution in all ocean basins from equatorial to polar regions. As is the case with most species of rorquals, Fin Whales have a seasonal migratory pattern that generally involves moving between high-latitude feeding grounds and low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds. Important habitats are primarily associated with topographic and oceanographic conditions on feeding grounds and along parts of their migration route. Locations of summer, polar feeding grounds are more easily defined and predictable for Fin Whales than locations of their winter breeding and birthing grounds, which are more diffuse across broad spans of longitude. In the central and eastern North Atlantic Ocean, Northern Fin Whales are most common during boreal summer in waters over the continental slope and continental shelf seaward of the 200m isobath (line demarking the same depths underwater), whereas along the Eastern Seaboard of the USA, they tend to be most abundant in waters over the continental shelf centered on the 100 m isobath but extending into shallower and deeper waters. Northern Fin Whales are locally common in continental shelf waters of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the adjacent Saint Lawrence Estuary, where their distribution appears to be associated with areas of high productivity that are driven by conditions of tidal and current mixing aligned along steep contours of the drowned Laurentian Channel. Formation of pack ice in winter forces Northern Fin Whales offshore, while breakup of sea ice in spring allows whales to move back inshore. Concentrations of Northern Fin Whales in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea generally occur along the shelfsslope break (¢.200 m isobath) where frontal boundaries or mixing zones between coastal and pelagic waters result in high primary productivity during boreal summer. In waters off British Columbia, Canada, Northern Fin Whales also frequent continental shelf waters of the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound, where topographic and oceanographic conditions again appear to concentrate zooplankton. In the Southern Ocean, Southern Fin Whales typically do not range to the edge of the Antarctic pack ice during austral summer like Blue Whales and Antarctic Minke Whales ( B. bonaerensis ). Southern Fin Whales tend to migrate in pelagic waters, and whaling records documentthis migration as occurring along coasts of South America as far north as Peru in the South Pacific Ocean and north-eastern Brazil in the South Atlantic Ocean, along coasts of Africa north of South Africa in the South Atlantic and Indian oceans, and in waters north of Australia and New Zealand. Whaling recordsalso indicate that Southern Fin Whales formerly occurred during austral winter in warm oceanic waters of the central South Atlantic and South Pacific oceans far from land. These general migratory patterns are more complex in some parts of the Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere, with resident or semi-resident subpopulations reported in areas with more year-round abundance of prey (e.g. Gulf of California and the Mediterranean Sea).","The Fin Whale is relatively euryphagous (compared with the Blue Whale) and consumes a variety of prey depending on availability and season, sometimes feeding exclusively on pelagic crustaceans and other times consuming only schooling fish. This opportunistic feeding strategy is well illustrated by the resident population of Northern Fin Whales in the Gulf of California, where they feed on krill in protected waters of Bahia de Loreto in winter but move farther north in the Gulf to feed on schooling fish in summer. In other regions of the Northern Hemisphere, the preferred invertebrate prey is krill (Meganyctiphanes spp., Euphausia spp., and Thysanoessa spp.), although copepods (Calanus spp.) are also consumed in abundance and occasionally squid (Ommastrephes spp. and Gonatus spp.). Schooling fish preferred by foraging Northern Fin Whales occur in dense aggregations depending on location and time of year and include herring (Clupea spp.), cod (Gadus spp.), mackerel (Scomber spp.), pollock (Pollachius spp.), and capelin (Mallotus villosus). In the Southern Ocean, Southern Fin Whales feed almost exclusively on krill (Euphausia spp.), as do Blue Whales, and the widespread distribution of this abundant prey near the Antarctic Convergence means that the two species of rorquals are broadly sympatric in large mixed groups on austral summer feeding grounds. This pattern of sympatry combined with the close phylogenetic relationship between Fin Whales and Blue Whales helps explain the common occurrence of Fin Whale x Blue Whale hybrids, including at least one reported hybrid female that was pregnant. During winter, most populations of Southern Fin Whale undergo some form of migration to breeding and birthing grounds in lower latitudes, where they are said to fast, although it may be more accurate to say that they simply consume less food. Whaling records indicate that toward the end of winter, Southern Fin Whales are distinctly thinner and more emaciated than when they first arrive on breeding grounds in spring. Butchered carcasses of wintering whales yielded less oil and their stomachs typically were empty. It is not until Southern Fin Whales arrive again on high-latitude feeding grounds that they begin to rebuild their energy stores of blubber. Recent research using various digital instrument packages temporarily attached to backs of foraging Fin Whales has greatly expanded our knowledge of their feeding behavior. A typical foraging event involves a series of dives, some as deep as 300 m. Although the start of a dive begins with powerful fluking, much of the descent is in the form of a glide. At the bottom of each dive, an individual performs a series of lunges, each involving an initial burst of speed (up to 3 m/s) followed by a rapid deceleration (less than 1 m/s) during which lower jaws gape to almost 90° and ventral throat pouch inflates somewhat like a parachute. Estimates suggest that pouch fills at the rate of ¢.20 m?/s and mouth begins to close three seconds into the lunge and is completely closed after a lapse of only six seconds. At this point, the throat pouch has greatly expanded to occupy up to 60% of total body length and contain as much as 70,000 1 of sea water weighing as much as 60,000 kg. Surprisingly, in less than a minute, all of the engulfed water passes out through the baleen apparatus as the pouch steadily deflates trapping as much as 10 kg of krill in the mouth. Foraging Fin Whales perform an average of 4-4 lunges/dive and return to the surface powered by steady and powerful fluking. After several hours of foraging dives, an adult Fin Whale can ingest more than 1000 kg ofkrill, providing enough energy to sustain it for an entire day, while also building up energy stores for the coming winter.","As with most species of rorquals, reproductive biology of Fin Whales is poorly known, with the majority of available information provided by postmortem whaling records. These data suggest that females in the Northern Hemisphere formerly reached sexual maturity at 10-12 years of age but that age of sexual maturity has now been developmentally accelerated due to density-dependent factors related to low population size. Current estimates for the onset of sexual maturity in northern waters are down to 6-7 years of age. Estimates of body length at sexual maturity have not changed for female Northern Fin Whales and remain at ¢.1850 cm. Males show a similar pattern of developmental acceleration, and although formerly reaching sexual maturity at c.11 years of age, it is now estimated at only c.5 years of age and a body length of ¢.1750 cm. Sexual maturity of female and male Southern Fin Whales formerly occurred at c.12 years and c.11 years, respectively, but it has now fallen to c.6 years and c.4 years. Related body length measurements at sexual maturity for female and male Southern Fin Whales have remained at ¢.2000 cm and ¢.1900 cm, respectively. Reproductive cycle of Fin Whales is closely tied to their seasonal migration between high-latitude feeding grounds and low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds. In general, pregnant females give birth in the same temperate waters where conception occurred during the prior winter. Gestation is usually c.11 months, with a single young typically born in the respective austral or boreal winter. Although rare, twin births have been reported. Young are ¢.640 cm in length at birth and weigh 1000-1500 kg. Young are weaned at 6-7 months at a length of 1100-1300 cm. Whaling statistics suggest a neonatal growth rate of 50-60 kg/day and up to 3 cm/day, while consuming 72 kg/day of milk. After weaning, growth rate slows to an average of 26 cm/month up to sexual maturity at c.2-3 years of age. Sex ratio of neonates is essentially 1:1, which probably holds for much of the year except for periods when differential segregation of sexes or sexual classes occurs on or at the ends of the seasonal migrations. Females are reported to reproduce on a 2year cycle, suggesting an interbirth interval of ¢.6 months. There is some evidence that at least some populations of Fin Whales have mating systems involving male—male competition to monopolize females. Limited observational sampling seems to show that mating sometimes involves a group of 3—4 individuals, with two whales involved in copulation and attendant males as bystanders. One study of Northern Fin Whales in the Gulf of California also has documented singing males that produce long, low-frequency vocalizations that may attract females to dense patches of food, where mating then may occur. Conception typically occurs in respective austral and boreal winters, with peaks in December—January in the Northern Hemisphere and June-July in the Southern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, whaling statistics correlating embryo size with geographical location and time of year suggest that mating may take place throughout the year in some areas. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs from ear canals of butchered whales suggest that Fin Whales live for 90-100 years.","Daily activity patterns of Fin Whales have been described on summer feeding grounds in both hemispheres and consist of foraging individuals generally following the diel movement cycle of their prey species (deep water during the day and shallow water at night). Like most species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Fin Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding and birthing grounds.","The Fin Whale has a cosmopolitan geographical distribution like most species of rorquals and occurs in all ocean basins from equatorial to polar regions. They are the only rorqual that regularly occurs in the Mediterranean Sea but are absent from most tropical regions. Although Fin Whales exhibit the general annual migration cycle of other rorquals, moving from polar feeding grounds to temperate breeding and birthing grounds, certain populations undergo considerably longer migrations than others. In the North Pacific Ocean, Northern Fin Whales are distributed mainly north of 30° N during boreal summer, extending into the Gulf of Alaska and later in summer into the Bering Sea and even the Chuckchi Sea. In the western North Pacific Ocean, summer distribution of Northern Fin Whales extends from waters around Japan northward into the Sea of Okhotsk. Winter grounds are less well known but appear to include waters from California south to the tip of Baja California in the east and offshore well into the central Pacific Ocean. In the western North Pacific Ocean, Northern Fin Whales are reported during winter from the Sea ofJapan, the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea through the Philippine Sea. This general seasonal pattern breaks down in areas where prey abundance is more stable throughout the year, such as in waters off central and southern California (35° N). In addition, a resident subpopulation in the Gulf of California is known to live year-round throughout this oceanographically complex body of water. Northern Fin Whales occur throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, generally north of 30° N where the Gulf Stream appears to moderate their annual migration cycles. During boreal summer, Northern Fin Whales in the east penetrate as far north as waters around Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean, but rarely north of the Barents Sea, while in the western North Atlantic Ocean, they summer in Baffin Bay, the Davis Strait, and waters off Labrador and Newfoundland south to Cape Hatteras. These occurrences may represent separate northern and southern subpopulations. During boreal winter, Northern Fin Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean typically leave their northern feeding grounds and migrate into warmer, southern waters of the West Indies in the west and from the Bay of Biscay and Spain to the Canary Islands in the east. Migration typically occurs in open ocean making it difficult to determine migration routes and actual destinations. Northern Fin Whales have been reported to overwinter in the North Sea and adjacent waters during mild winters, generally moving offshore to avoid pack ice. A resident subpopulation of Northern Fin Whales, genetically distinct from those in the North Atlantic Ocean, is reported to occur in the central and western Mediterranean Sea. Southern Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere occur throughout the Southern Ocean during austral summer, mainly between 40° S and 60° S, except in the South Pacific Ocean region where they may penetrate nearly to the Antarctic Circle. The anti-tropical distribution of Fin Whales is centered at temperate latitudes and the 6month, out-of-phase nature of the migration cycle, with Southern Hemisphere populations at low latitudes at the same time that Northern Hemisphere populations are at high latitudes and vice versa, means that there are little if any instances of sympatry and thus limited opportunities for interbreeding among populations in the two hemispheres. Migrations typically are segregated by sexes and sex classes, with pregnant females usually preceding other individuals, soon followed by adult males and anestrous females, and finally by lactating females, their young, and juveniles. On winter grounds where births occur, sex ratio of neonates from whaling records is 1:1. Fin Whales are not gregarious, and the only consistent social bond is the ephemeral mother—offspring pairing that lasts from birth to weaning. During migrations, group size typically is small, with groups of 2-7 individuals. Solitary individuals, however, are the norm. On summer feeding grounds, groups of considerably more individuals have been reported, but these aggregations lack any obvious social organization and instead generally reflect high abundance of prey in these high productivity polar waters. In the North Pacific Ocean, these feeding aggregations often form along shelf edge where oceanic frontal boundaries or zones of mixing between shelf and oceanic waters occur. No accounts of cooperative feeding behavior have been reported for Fin Whales.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List, with the subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea listed as Vulnerable. The Fin Whale has been listed as endangered in the USA since 1970. Causes of population decline are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. Commercial whaling of Northern Fin Whales began in the late 19"" century in the North Atlantic Ocean, and an estimated 45,000 individuals were killed in this region (Canada to Svalbard) in 1876-1915. An additional 55,000 Northern Fin Whales are estimated to have been killed in commercial whaling operations in 1915-1986, after which the International Whaling Commission (IWC) set catch limits for all whales at zero (commercial whaling moratorium). A similar record of intense hunting is documented for commercial whaling activities in the North Pacific Ocean, where ¢.74,000 Northern Fin Whales were killed in 1910-1975. This figure does not include thousands of unspecified whales documented in 1900-1930 whaling statistics. These numbers, however, pale compared with whaling records from the Southern Hemisphere, which document more 725,000 Southern Fin Whales killed in 1905-1976. The majority of these whales (703,693) were killed in the Southern Ocean, where hunting of Southern Fin Whales intensified in the 1930s as populations of Blue Whales declined because of overhunting. During the peak of commercial exploitation (1935-1970), c.30,000 Southern Fin Whales were killed annually. By 1974, whaling operations were killing less than 1000 Southern Fin Whales/year, a decline that underscored the unsustainability ofthis level of hunting. Commercial whaling of the Fin Whale ended in 1976 in the North Pacific Ocean, after the 1976-1977 season in the Southern Ocean, and in 1987 in the North Atlantic Ocean. Northern Fin Whales are hunted still in waters off Greenland, with up to 20 individuals killed annually under the IWC’s “aboriginal subsistence whaling” scheme. Iceland resumed commercial whaling of Northern Fin Whales in 2006 under a formal objection to the IWC’s ban on commercial whaling, and Japan starting killing Fin Whales in the 2005-2006 season as part of its “scientific whaling” program. Protected from intense commercial whaling since 1985, populations of Fin Whales in both hemispheres have started to increase, although rate of increase and population trends have not been calculated. Estimates placed the cumulative North Atlantic population of the Northern Fin Whale at ¢.52,000 individuals in 2001 and the Mediterranean population at 3583 individuals in 1991. In 1975 the cumulative North Pacific population of Northern Fin Whales was estimated at ¢.17,000 individuals. Estimates for Southern Hemisphere populations of Southern Fin Whales are of questionable reliability and varied from a low of ¢.15,000 individuals in 1983 to a high of ¢.85,200 individuals in 1979. As with other species of rorquals, the international moratorium on commercial whaling that began in 1986 represents the primary conservation measure for insuring survival of the Fin Whale. Ongoing threats are essentially the same as for other whale species and include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (whale watching harassment), habitat decline and interference, aboriginal whaling, and “scientific research.” Additional threats posed by climate change and potential loss of prey base and shifts in critical habitat are of unknown impact to the recovery of the Fin Whale.",Aguilar (2009) | Bérubé et al.

Balaena physalus Linnaeus, 1758 , “Habitat in Oceano Europao.” Restricted by Thomas in 1911 to “ Norway , near Svalbard , Spitsbergen Sea .” Genetic support for recognition of subspecies of B. physalus is weak at the moment, although preliminary studies of mitochondrial and nuclear markers suggest distinct differentiation among populations in different ocean basins. Morphological support for separate northern and southern subspecies primarily relies on size differences (larger in Southern Hemisphere), although it also appears that northern populations have shorter and broader flippers than southern populations. A possible third subspecies, patachonica , named by Burmeister in 1865, is included in the list of Marine Mammal Species and subspecies. However, this form is not currently recognized by IUCN. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. B.p.physalusLinnaeus,1758—oceansoftheNorthernHemisphere. B. p. quoyi Fischer, 1829 — oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. Descriptive notes. Total length 2200-2700 cm; weight 60,000-90,000 kg. Adult female Fin Whales can be 5-10% longer than males. Total body length estimates are 2500 cm and 2700 cm for male and female “Southern Fin Whales” (B. b. quoyi ) and 2200 cm and 2400 cm for male and female “Northern Fin Whales” (B. b. physalus ).

Current estimates for the onset of sexual maturity in northern waters are down to 6-7 years of age. Estimates of body length at sexual maturity have not changed for female Northern Fin Whales and remain at ¢.1850 cm. Males show a similar pattern of developmental acceleration, and although formerly reaching sexual maturity at c.11 years of age, it is now estimated at only c.5 years of age and a body length of ¢.1750 cm. Sexual maturity of female and male Southern Fin Whales formerly occurred at c.12 years and c.11 years, respectively, but it has now fallen to c.6 years and c.4 years. Related body length measurements at sexual maturity for female and male Southern Fin Whales have remained at ¢.2000 cm and ¢.1900 cm, respectively. Reproductive cycle of Fin Whales is closely tied to their seasonal migration between high-latitude feeding grounds and low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds. In general, pregnant females give birth in the same temperate waters where conception occurred during the prior winter. Gestation is usually c.11 months, with a single young typically born in the respective austral or boreal winter. Although rare, twin births have been reported. Young are ¢.640 cm in length at birth and weigh 1000-1500 kg. Young are weaned at 6-7 months at a length of 1100-1300 cm. Whaling statistics suggest a neonatal growth rate of 50-60 kg/day and up to 3 cm/day, while consuming 72 kg/day of milk. After weaning, growth rate slows to an average of 26 cm/month up to sexual maturity at c.2-3 years of age. Sex ratio of neonates is essentially 1:1, which probably holds for much of the year except for periods when differential segregation of sexes or sexual classes occurs on or at the ends of the seasonal migrations. Females are reported to reproduce on a 2year cycle, suggesting an interbirth interval of ¢.6 months. There is some evidence that at least some populations of Fin Whales have mating systems involving male—male competition to monopolize females. Limited observational sampling seems to show that mating sometimes involves a group of 3—4 individuals, with two whales involved in copulation and attendant males as bystanders. One study of Northern Fin Whales in the Gulf of California also has documented singing males that produce long, low-frequency vocalizations that may attract females to dense patches of food, where mating then may occur. Conception typically occurs in respective austral and boreal winters, with peaks in December—January in the Northern Hemisphere and June-July in the Southern Hemisphere. Nevertheless, whaling statistics correlating embryo size with geographical location and time of year suggest that mating may take place throughout the year in some areas. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs from ear canals of butchered whales suggest that Fin Whales live for 90-100 years. Activity patterns. Daily activity patterns of Fin Whales have been described on summer feeding grounds in both hemispheres and consist of foraging individuals generally following the diel movement cycle of their prey species (deep water during the day and shallow water at night). Like most species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Fin Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding and birthing grounds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Fin Whale has a cosmopolitan geographical distribution like most species of rorquals and occurs in all ocean basins from equatorial to polar regions. They are the only rorqual that regularly occurs in the Mediterranean Sea but are absent from most tropical regions. Although Fin Whales exhibit the general annual migration cycle of other rorquals, moving from polar feeding grounds to temperate breeding and birthing grounds, certain populations undergo considerably longer migrations than others. In the North Pacific Ocean, Northern Fin Whales are distributed mainly north of 30° N during boreal summer, extending into the Gulf of Alaska and later in summer into the Bering Sea and even the Chuckchi Sea. In the western North Pacific Ocean, summer distribution of Northern Fin Whales extends from waters around Japan northward into the Sea of Okhotsk. Winter grounds are less well known but appear to include waters from California south to the tip of Baja California in the east and offshore well into the central Pacific Ocean. In the western North Pacific Ocean, Northern Fin Whales are reported during winter from the Sea ofJapan, the Yellow Sea, and the East China Sea through the Philippine Sea. This general seasonal pattern breaks down in areas where prey abundance is more stable throughout the year, such as in waters off central and southern California (35° N). In addition, a resident subpopulation in the Gulf of California is known to live year-round throughout this oceanographically complex body of water. Northern Fin Whales occur throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, generally north of 30° N where the Gulf Stream appears to moderate their annual migration cycles. During boreal summer, Northern Fin Whales in the east penetrate as far north as waters around Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean, but rarely north of the Barents Sea, while in the western North Atlantic Ocean, they summer in Baffin Bay, the Davis Strait, and waters off Labrador and Newfoundland south to Cape Hatteras. These occurrences may represent separate northern and southern subpopulations. During boreal winter, Northern Fin Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean typically leave their northern feeding grounds and migrate into warmer, southern waters of the West Indies in the west and from the Bay of Biscay and Spain to the Canary Islands in the east. Migration typically occurs in open ocean making it difficult to determine migration routes and actual destinations. Northern Fin Whales have been reported to overwinter in the North Sea and adjacent waters during mild winters, generally moving offshore to avoid pack ice. A resident subpopulation of Northern Fin Whales, genetically distinct from those in the North Atlantic Ocean, is reported to occur in the central and western Mediterranean Sea. Southern Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere occur throughout the Southern Ocean during austral summer, mainly between 40° S and 60° S, except in the South Pacific Ocean region where they may penetrate nearly to the Antarctic Circle. The anti-tropical distribution of Fin Whales is centered at temperate latitudes and the 6month, out-of-phase nature of the migration cycle, with Southern Hemisphere populations at low latitudes at the same time that Northern Hemisphere populations are at high latitudes and vice versa, means that there are little if any instances of sympatry and thus limited opportunities for interbreeding among populations in the two hemispheres. Migrations typically are segregated by sexes and sex classes, with pregnant females usually preceding other individuals, soon followed by adult males and anestrous females, and finally by lactating females, their young, and juveniles. On winter grounds where births occur, sex ratio of neonates from whaling records is 1:1. Fin Whales are not gregarious, and the only consistent social bond is the ephemeral mother—offspring pairing that lasts from birth to weaning. During migrations, group size typically is small, with groups of 2-7 individuals. Solitary individuals, however, are the norm. On summer feeding grounds, groups of considerably more individuals have been reported, but these aggregations lack any obvious social organization and instead generally reflect high abundance of prey in these high productivity polar waters. In the North Pacific Ocean, these feeding aggregations often form along shelf edge where oceanic frontal boundaries or zones of mixing between shelf and oceanic waters occur. No accounts of cooperative feeding behavior have been reported for Fin Whales. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List, with the subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea listed as Vulnerable. The Fin Whale has been listed as endangered in the USA since 1970. Causes of population decline are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. Commercial whaling of Northern Fin Whales began in the late 19"" century in the North Atlantic Ocean, and an estimated 45,000 individuals were killed in this region (Canada to Svalbard) in 1876-1915. An additional 55,000 Northern Fin Whales are estimated to have been killed in commercial whaling operations in 1915-1986, after which the International Whaling Commission (IWC) set catch limits for all whales at zero (commercial whaling moratorium). A similar record of intense hunting is documented for commercial whaling activities in the North Pacific Ocean, where ¢.74,000 Northern Fin Whales were killed in 1910-1975. This figure does not include thousands of unspecified whales documented in 1900-1930 whaling statistics. These numbers, however, pale compared with whaling records from the Southern Hemisphere, which document more 725,000 Southern Fin Whales killed in 1905-1976. The majority of these whales (703,693) were killed in the Southern Ocean, where hunting of Southern Fin Whales intensified in the 1930s as populations of Blue Whales declined because of overhunting. During the peak of commercial exploitation (1935-1970), c.30,000 Southern Fin Whales were killed annually. By 1974, whaling operations were killing less than 1000 Southern Fin Whales/year, a decline that underscored the unsustainability ofthis level of hunting. Commercial whaling of the Fin Whale ended in 1976 in the North Pacific Ocean, after the 1976-1977 season in the Southern Ocean, and in 1987 in the North Atlantic Ocean. Northern Fin Whales are hunted still in waters off Greenland, with up to 20 individuals killed annually under the IWC’s “aboriginal subsistence whaling” scheme. Iceland resumed commercial whaling of Northern Fin Whales in 2006 under a formal objection to the IWC’s ban on commercial whaling, and Japan starting killing Fin Whales in the 2005-2006 season as part of its “scientific whaling” program. Protected from intense commercial whaling since 1985, populations of Fin Whales in both hemispheres have started to increase, although rate of increase and population trends have not been calculated. Estimates placed the cumulative North Atlantic population of the Northern Fin Whale at ¢.52,000 individuals in 2001 and the Mediterranean population at 3583 individuals in 1991. In 1975 the cumulative North Pacific population of Northern Fin Whales was estimated at ¢.17,000 individuals. Estimates for Southern Hemisphere populations of Southern Fin Whales are of questionable reliability and varied from a low of ¢.15,000 individuals in 1983 to a high of ¢.85,200 individuals in 1979. As with other species of rorquals, the international moratorium on commercial whaling that began in 1986 represents the primary conservation measure for insuring survival of the Fin Whale. Ongoing threats are essentially the same as for other whale species and include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (whale watching harassment), habitat decline and interference, aboriginal whaling, and “scientific research.” Additional threats posed by climate change and potential loss of prey base and shifts in critical habitat are of unknown impact to the recovery of the Fin Whale.

Although there are no officially recognized subspecies, molecular evidence supports recognition of distinct populations in different ocean basins.","Cosmopolitan, found in all oceans of the world, but with only rare incursions into the Mediterranean Sea. .","Total length 1500-1700 cm; weight 30,000-34,000 kg. Adult female Humpback Whales are 40-70 cm longer than males. Mean lengths of physically mature males and females are 1300 cm and 1390 cm, respectively, while mean lengths at sexual maturity are 1180 cm and 1190 cm. The Humpback Whale is relatively shorter and stouter than any other species of rorquals and has a distinct countershading color pattern. Dorsal side of body is uniformly black, and ventral surface can be variably colored, ranging from black to white or mottled black and white. Some populations display an extension of white coloration up flanks. Underside of pectoral flipper typically is white, and color on dorsal surface can vary from all black in most Southern Hemisphere individuals to all white in most Northern Hemisphere individuals. Both lower lips are a uniform black and lack coloration asymmetry of the Fin Whale ( B. physalus ) and Omura’s Whale ( B. omurai ). Head of the Humpback Whale is relatively large, 28-30% oftotal body length. External surface of rostrum has a single, low, median ridge that is generally obscured by a series of fleshy knobs (dermal tubercles) that are spaced along it from blowholes to tip of snout. From above, lateral margin of rostrum of the Humpback Whale is slightly convex and intermediate in shape between the broadly U-shaped rostrum of the Blue Whale ( B. musculus ) and the more sharply pointed rostrum of the Fin Whale. In lateral view, rostrum of the Humpback Whale has a distinctly flattened profile. Dorsal fin is relatively small (up to 30 cm tall) and variably developed, ranging from low and blunt to sharply falcate. Dorsal fin is positioned slightly more than two-thirds the distance between tip of rostrum and flukes and is often located on a low fleshy hump. Pectoral flipper is remarkable in size, being the largest pectoral appendage of any known animal, living or extinct. Relatively slender pectoral flippers can reach up to 500 cm in length (25-33% of total body length) and have scalloped leading edges marked by fleshy tubercles that often are encrusted with barnacles (most commonly Coronula diadema and Conchoderma awritum). Position of individual tubercles corresponds to locations of bony joints within each flipper. As with all species of rorquals,flipper of the Humpback Whale has only four elongate digits (digit I is lost). The first and generally largest tubercle occurs at the position of the joint between radius and the first bone (metacarpal) of digit II, while the next two tubercles occur at the inter-phalangeal joints along digit II. The large fourth tubercle lies at the level of the terminus of digit II and distal to this, successive tubercles along flipper’s leading edge are located at the inter-phalangeal joints along digit III. Wind-tunnel experiments have shown that scalloped leading edges of flippers of Humpback Whales greatly reduce drag, increase lift, and generally improve performance and maneuverability of these impressive wing-like appendages. Caudal flukes of Humpback Whales are relatively large (compared with those of Sei Whales, B. borealis ), the width measuring c.27-33-5% oftotal body length. Long trailing edge of caudal flukes is distinctly serrated and marked by a deep median notch. Serration pattern and color on underside of flukes have been used extensively to identify individual Humpback Whales. As with other areas on body,tips of flukes of Humpback Whales are often encrusted with clusters of barnacles. Flukes typically are marked by numerous linear scars thought to result of unsuccessful attacks by Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Ventral groove blubber of the Humpback Whale is rather distinct and has only 12-36 relatively wide longitudinal pleats that extend from tip ofjaws to umbilicus. This numberis fewer than recorded for any other species of rorquals. Baleen apparatus of the Humpback Whale consists of individual plates that, like most rorquals, are short and broad, with an average length-to-width ratio typically c.2:1. Largest main baleen plates are 85-107 cm in length. Fringing baleen bristles of the Humpback Whale are intermediate in diameter between the Blue Whale (coarse) and the Sei Whale (fine). Baleen of the Humpback Whale is generally dark gray to black and often has white longitudinal streaks. Baleen laminae in front of rack may be all white to yellowish-white. Nevertheless, there is no consistent asymmetry in baleen coloration as occurs in the Fin Whale. Fringe bristle color of the Humpback Whale varies from dark gray or black to brown, or even white. Number of baleen laminae are 270-400 /side, with older individuals typically having more laminae. Humpback Whales are the slowest swimmers of the rorquals and although capable of short bursts of 25 km/h, their normal cruising speeds are 5-14 km/h. At sea, blowhole and low dorsal fin are often visible at the same time when an individual is surfacing. Blow is relatively low and bushy and generally up to 2-3 m high. When diving, Humpback Whales typically arch their backs high above the water and follow this with raised caudal flukes that display distinctive undersides. The Humpback Whale is well known for its “aquabatics” (in water displays) that can involve full breaches. Although Humpback Whales have many additional unique morphological features relative to other rorquals, molecular studies suggest that they are more closely related to Fin Whales than to other species of rorquals and do not represent a distinct evolutionary lineage separate from the Balaenoptera lineage. For this reason it is questionable whether continued use of the separate generic name, Megaptera , is appropriate.","Cosmopolitan distribution and found in all ocean basins. Like most species of rorquals, Humpback Whales undergo long seasonal migrations from low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds to high-latitude feeding grounds. Habitat preferences are difficult to define for highly mobile animals like the Humpback Whale, and they clearly vary with seasons (summer feeding grounds vs. winter breeding and birthing grounds). Management plans generally focus on areas that are currently known to seasonally support significant aggregations of Humpback Whales, such as birthing, resting, and feeding areas and segments of migratory routes. In winter breeding and birthing grounds, water depth appears to be an important limiting factor controlling social organization, with mother—offspring pairs showing a strong preference for waters less than 20 m deep. Such waters characteristically occur near offshore reef systems, islands, channels, and continental shelf areas. Distance from shore seems to be another limiting factor that influences group size and social organization. Larger groups of Humpback Whales are generally found farther from shore than smaller groups. Association of mother—offspring pairs and mother—offspring—escort trios in shallow water and near-shore locations on winter breeding grounds may also reflect a preference of receptive females or females with young for protection from rough seas. In summer feeding grounds, water temperature and position of continental shelf-slope breaks, ice-edge zones, oceanic fronts, eastern boundary currents, and areas of upwelling are limiting factors controlling distribution of nutrients, primary producers, primary consumers,first-order predators, and whales. Although difficult to clearly define as critical habitat, these areas are obviously important to the survival of the Humpback Whale.","The diet of the Humpback Whale has been compared with that of the Fin Whale because both species are known to feed on marine invertebrates and vertebrates. This is especially true for populations of Humpback Whales in the Northern Hemisphere where studies of stomach contents of butchered individuals found distinct dietary patterns. Stomach contents often contained a single species of schooling fish, either herring (Chupeaspp.), capelin (Mallotus villosus), sand lance ( Ammodytes spp. ), or pollock (Pollachius spp.), but others had combinations of various vertebrate prey. Invertebrate prey species found in stomachs of Humpback Whales in the Northern Hemisphere included monotypic or polytypic aggregations of planktonic crustaceans (euphausids, mysids, or copepods) and benthonic species (amphipods). The apparent benthonic feeding strategy exhibited by some foraging Humpback Whales is rare for a species of rorqual and results in some individuals ingesting quantities of sand and gravel—also reported in stomach contents of butchered individuals. More recent studies using stable isotope analysis of biopsy dart samples, in combination with ship-based observation of feeding Humpback Whales in the Bering Sea, suggest a link between prey preference and habitat, with individuals tending to feed on fish in neritic areas and on plankton in deep oceanic waters. Unlike northern populations, Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere appear to feed almost exclusively on pelagic planktonic crustaceans, primarily krill (Euphausia superba). Like all species of rorquals, the Humpback Whale is a lunge-feeder but also has evolved an impressive repertoire of specialized feeding strategies. Perhaps the most unique of these is the practice of bubble-net feeding in which a single individual or, more often, a cooperative grouping of several individuals use bubbles to concentrate schooling fish. A typical cooperative “bubble-netting” event begins with individuals diving to a level below schooling fish, where one individual begins to swim in an ever-narrowing circle while blowing a ring of bubbles. As the curtain of bubbles rises toward the surface, reflections and noise from bubbles scare fish into a tighter grouping, which is made even more concentrated and compact by loud feeding calls made by another individual in the group. When the resulting bait ball is near the water’s surface, the whales ascend through the bubble net and lunge-feed, often breaking the surface in what some observers refer to as a single collective gulp. Such cooperative feeding groups of Humpback Whales are fluid in terms of membership and may number as many as 15 individuals. A variation of bubble netting, called lobtail feeding, has been documented in Humpback Whales feeding in the North Atlantic Ocean and involves an individual slapping the water's surface above a school of fish before diving to blow the bubble screen. Both behaviors are thought to help concentrate prey, and a study that tracked the spread of this unique foraging innovation over 27years concluded that lobtail feeding was being “culturally” transmitted through the population. Humpback Whales also herd prey by using their flukes, pectoral flippers, or both to disturb the water column. Humpback Whales often herd prey toward the water’s surface, which functions as an escape barrier to concentrate prey. There is also some evidence of other forms of cooperative hunting with individual groups of Humpback Whales feeding in formation or using acoustic calls to synchronize feeding lunges.","Reproductive biology of the Humpback Whale is probably the best known and most complex of any species of rorqual. Females and males reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age, although this figure may be closer to c.8 years in some areas. Female Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere reach sexual maturity at an average body length of 1160-1250 cm and males at 1110-1200 cm. Comparable measurements for the Northern Hemisphere are 1000-1200 cm and 1000-1150 cm, respectively. Reproductive cycle of the Humpback Whale, like most rorquals,is strongly seasonal and in tune with annual migration to low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds. Females come into estrus in winter, and males follow suit by undergoing spermatogenesis and increased testosterone production. Conception primarily occurs during respective austral and boreal winters, with a peak around September in the Southern Hemisphere and February in the Northern Hemisphere. Whaling data, however, suggest that ovulation and successful mating also may occur at other times of the year. Gestation typically lasts 11-11-5 months, with a single young born in the subsequent austral or boreal winter. Although twin fetuses have been reported from butchered pregnant females, live twin births have not been documented. Whaling data also suggest that embryos grow at an average rate of 17-35 cm/month. Young are ¢.390-450 cm in length at birth and weigh 900 kg. Nursing young consume a minimum of 43 kg of milk/day. Young are weaned at 6-10 months on summer feeding grounds when they are ¢.990 cm in length. This suggests an average neonatal growth rate of ¢.3 cm/day. Young often remain with their mothers for up to a year. Females reportedly give birth every 2-3 years, although several examples are known of individual females giving birth nearly annually. Postpartum estrus may occur on a regular basis in Humpback Whales, which may explain male escorts in close company with mother—offspring pairs late in the breeding season. If females were not in estrus, it is unlikely that males would be showing such interest in them. Sex ratio of neonates is essentially 1:1, which probably holds for much of the year except for periods when differential segregation of sexes or sexual classes occurs on or at the ends of the seasonal migrations. On breeding grounds, operational sex ratio is male dominated because males typically remain longer in the area and relative number of fertilizable females is reduced by presence of immature and postpartum females. Both sexes apparently are promiscuous to some extent because paternity tests of young from individually identifiable females show that over successive seasons a given female may mate with several different males. This level of promiscuity calls into question the characterization of the Humpback Whale’s breeding strategy as solely polygynous. Details of the complexity of Humpback Whale’s breeding behavior have emerged from sustained research conducted since the late 1970s in warm waters around the main Hawaiian Islands. Humpback Whales begin arriving by December (some arrive as early as September), with peak abundance in February-March. The last Humpback Whales have usually departed by May, although some individuals remain as late as June in some years. Research suggests that the Humpback Whale practices a mainly polygynous mating system that grossly resembles a lek (males gathering to attract females). Although this mating system does not involve establishment of defensible territories, male Humpback Whales do exhibit aggressive competitive behaviors that include bubble screens, where a whale will forcefully blow bubbles from his blowholes; rear-body thrashing, where a whale throws his tail and peduncle out of the water before smashing it down sideways on the surface; horizontal tail slashing, where whales slash their tails horizontally through the water; and lobtailing, where a whale raises his flukes above the water before bringing them down to forcefully slap the surface. There are times when these aggressive behaviors result in actual physical contact that can lead to injury and,in rare instances, death. Males are also known to form temporary “coalitions” to drive away males in other competitive groups. Besides these male-male competition behaviors, Humpback Whales are also known to perform courtship behaviors that include rubbing or touching one another with their pectoral flippers; “flippering,” where whales raise their pectoral flippers out of the water and slap the surface; head-up displays, where whales horizontally elevate their heads above the surface and then slowly sink without swimming forward; vertical tail extensions, where whales vertically lift their tails out of the water; and escorting, where adult males join with a solitary or, more frequently, a female and her offspring. Vocalization, involving singing males, also plays an important role on the breeding grounds. Individual songs may last for 10-20 minutes, and some solo “performances” that repeat the song over and over may last for several hours or even days. All males in a given area basically sing the same, highly structured song, which consists of several tonal themes or “verses” that are sung in a generally consistent order. The performance appears to be highly ritualized and singers typically assume a motionless posture with head down, tail up, and flukes 7-15 m below the water’s surface. Over the course of the breeding season, the song in a given area evolves as new “verses” are added here and there. Within the context of a modified lek mating system, the song (vocal display) of singing males has been viewed as driven by sexual selection to attract females or dissuade competing males. This hypothesis suggests that the song provides some indication of the fitness of the singer. Although only adult male Humpback Whales sing, males and females produce a variety of different types of non-song vocalizations on breeding (and feeding) grounds and during migration. Other than mother—offspring pairs, the most stable social group among Humpback Whales on breeding grounds is a mother—offspring pair with an adult male escort. This group may remain together for hours or even days, and the escorting male typically remains within a body length of the female and appears to synchronize his breathing and dive patterns with hers. There are also tactile interactions where the male will touch the female with his pectoral flippers. Studies in the Hawaiian breeding grounds of the Humpback Whale suggest that as many as 86% of mother—offspring pairs in a given season have been accompanied by an adult male escort. These interactions generally occur later in the breeding season after some of the postpartum females have come into estrus. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs taken from external ear canals of dead Humpback Whales suggest that they may live up to 48 years.","Daily activity patterns have been described for Humpback Whales on summer feeding grounds in both hemispheres and consist of foraging individuals generally following the diel movements cycle of their prey (deep water during the day and shallow water at night). Like most species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Humpback Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding and birthing grounds.","Migratory patterns, breeding and feeding areas, and population structure of the Humpback Whale are probably better known than for any other species of rorquals. A number of factors combine to provide this increased level of understanding including its general near-shore migratory routes; its preference for breeding areas near islands, banks, and reefs; and its preference for feeding areas near shelf-slope breaks, regional marine embayments, or channels. Slower swimming speed of Humpback Whales and its affinity for exuberant aquabatics make it easier to study directly. The Humpback Whale holds the record for the longest known migration of any mammal. In support of this claim is the report of a group of seven whales (including a young) that traveled from the tropical North Pacific breeding and birthing area off Costa Rica and Panama to feeding grounds around Antarctica, a distance of more than 8300 km. Another example of long distance migration involves the well-defined migration route of Humpback Whales between summer feeding grounds in Alaskan waters and winter breeding and birthing grounds in warm waters around Hawaii, a distance of ¢.4830 km. There are several accounts of photo-identified individuals completing this crossing in as few as 36 days, which translates to an average swimming speed of 134 km/day or an average of 5:6 km/h. In the North Pacific Ocean, Humpback Whales feed during summer in waters from the Chukchi Sea south to Honshu in the west and southern California in the east. Their winter migration takes them to three primary breeding and birthing grounds: western subtropical to tropical waters off southern China, Taiwan, and the Philippines east to the Marshall Islands; waters around the main oceanic islands of the Hawaiian archipelago; and warm waters off the southern tip of Baja California, the Revillagigedo Islands, and adjacent mainland Mexico. In the North Atlantic Ocean, Humpback Whales feed during boreal summer in waters as far north as the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, and Barents Sea, and as far south as the Gulf of Maine in the west and Ireland in the east. Primary boreal winter migration routes in the North Atlantic Ocean take Humpback Whales to breeding and birthing grounds in the West Indies around Hispaniola (19° N). A small number of Humpback Whales also visit breeding grounds around the Cape Verde Islands (15°-17° N). The likelihood of at least a third, currently unknown, breeding and birthing area in the North Atlantic Ocean is suggested by genetic evidence. The population of Humpback Whales in the northern Indian Ocean is blocked from migrating northward during boreal winter by the Eurasian landmass and consequently remains year-round in warm waters of this region from the Gulf of Aden through the Arabian Sea and into the Bay of Bengal. Various populations of Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere spend austral summer feeding in highly productive waters south of the Antarctic Convergence to edge of the pack ice around Antarctica. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizessix latitudinally arranged feeding areas in the Southern Ocean that are visited by southward migrating Humpback Whales beginning in November, reaching a peak in January, and departing entirely by May. During austral winter migration, groups of Humpback Whales move north out of the Southern Ocean to seven primary breeding and birthing grounds that include waters of the western South Atlantic Ocean (coastal waters of Brazil from Natal to Cabo Frio and the Abrolhos Banks), the eastern South Atlantic Ocean (coastal waters from the Gulf of Guinea south to Cape Town), the south-western Indian Ocean (coastal waters of Mozambique and Madagascar), the south-eastern Indian Ocean (coastal waters of north-western Australia), the western South Pacific Ocean (the Coral Sea and tropical waters around Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga), the central South Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia and the Cook Islands), and the eastern South Pacific Ocean (Gulf of Panama south to the Gulf of Guyaquil and the Galapagos Islands). Interestingly, breeding grounds in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean and eastern South Pacific Ocean extend into tropical waters north of the Equator—a pattern that is probably related to the strong eastern boundary currents in these areas. Unlike other species of rorquals, Humpback Whales have been the focus of rather intensive fieldwork to determine population structure on feeding and breeding grounds. From this work,it appears that populations of Humpback Whale in the Northern Hemisphere typically come together on common breeding grounds but disperse into separate loosely affiliated groups as they leave for their summer feeding grounds. These migrating subpopulations show a high degree of genetic structure that suggests matrilineal fidelity to particular feeding grounds. During migration, social organization of individual groupsis quite fluid in terms of membership, with individualsjoining and leaving generally small groups on a somewhat regular basis. Population structure on the more communal feeding grounds, however, is probably diffuse, a possible result of male-mediated gene flow among subpopulations arriving from different feeding grounds. Feeding associations composed of multiple individuals tend to be temporary and dependent on constantly varying prey-patch size. Nevertheless, certain feeding associations (e.g. Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine) have been reported to be more stable and to last over most of the feeding season. Vocalization in Humpback Whales is a well-known social aspect of their behavior, especially relatively complex songs sung by solitary males on winter breeding grounds. Other forms of vocalization are known, and both males and females have been reported to make calls on summer feeding grounds or during annual migrations. As a form of communication among Humpback Whales, these calls or vocal sounds appear to have specific functions and, in some cases, are restricted to particular social groups. For example, vocal sounds termed “wops” seem to represent a contact call between a mother and her offspring, while “thwops” are thought to be a more general contact call among individuals of no particular gender or age group. A series of grunts or grunt trains has been associated with comingling of groups. Other vocal sounds produced by Humpback Whales include groans, snorts, “crys,” barks, and underwater blows or bubble bursts. Another form of social sounds used by Humpback Whales in communication are surface generated sounds such as those produced by breaching, which appears to communicate location and body size when an individual is leaving or joining a group, or pectoral slapping, which may be a signal from females to nearby males. These surface-generated sounds also increase in frequency when whales are excited and,at times, may represent no more than simple play.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The subpopulations of Humpback Whales in the Arabian Sea and Oceania are listed as Endangered. This charismatic rorqual species has been assigned a Least Concern category primarily because of the impressive increase in global populations that has occurred since intensive commercial overexploitation ended. Nevertheless, there are certain stocks that continue to remain at low population levels and,if considered on their own, would be assigned to a more threatened status. Causes of earlier global population decline are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. Shore-based whaling of Humpback Whales began in the 17"" century in the North Atlantic Ocean and increased in lethal effect with the advent of pelagic factory whaling. During 10years in the early 20"" century (1904-1913), ¢.19,986 Humpback Whales were killed in waters around South Georgia Island, while a little more than ten years later (1926-1935), the number killed declined to only 303 individuals in the same area. This sharp decline demonstrated the unsustainable nature of commercial exploitation of the Humpback Whale and other species of rorquals that was occurring at this time. The most recent population estimate for Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean from the West Indies breeding and birthing grounds in 1992-1993 was 10,752 individuals, which combined with photoidentification of 72 individuals in the Cape Verde Islands area provided a metric for computing annual rate of increase at 3-1%. Estimates of subpopulations of Humpback Whales on breeding grounds in the eastern North Pacific Ocean off Mexico in 2008 were 6000-7000 individuals, while 2008 estimates for the subpopulation in the western North Pacific Ocean on winter grounds south ofJapan was substantially less at 938-1107 individuals. Breeding grounds around the Hawaiian Islands appear to support the largest subpopulation of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific Ocean (7120-10,425 individuals). Analysis of 1991-1993 population data for the entire North Pacific Ocean suggests a rate of increase of 4-:9% /year. The year-round resident population of Humpback Whales in the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea) is probably the most threatened and, based on photo-identification data, consists ofless than 60 individuals. Populations of Humpback Whales have been relatively well studied in the Southern Hemisphere where as many as seven major breeding stocks are recognized by the IWC. Population assessments have only been completed for three of these stocks (south-western Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, south-eastern Indian Ocean off north-western Australia, and south-eastern Pacific Ocean off Ecuador, Columbia, and Panama), and this work serves as a useful measure of current status of Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere. The subpopulation in the south-western Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, which had been reduced to only a few hundred individuals by the mid-1960s, has made a strong recovery to a population on winter breeding grounds of ¢.6250 individuals based on 2002-2005 data. The population in the south-eastern Indian Ocean has also rebounded from a pre-moratorium level of ¢.1000 individuals to 10,032 individuals in 1999. Humpback Whales on breeding grounds of the southeastern Pacific Ocean were estimated at ¢.2917 individuals in 2003-2004. The current estimate of populations of Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is ¢.36,400 individuals. As with other species of rorquals, the international moratorium on commercial whaling that began in 1986 represents the primary conservation measure for insuring survival of the Humpback Whale. Ongoing threats are essentially the same as for other species of rorquals and include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (commercial shipping noise and whale watching harassment), habitat decline and interference, aboriginal whaling, and “scientific research.” In the latter case,Japan has issued scientific permits for its whaling fleet to engage in lethal sampling of Humpback Whales and has set an annual catch of 50 individuals. As of 2013, Japan has not implemented this plan.","Clapham (1996, 2009) | Clapham & Mead (1999) | Darling et al. (2006) | Ersts & Rosenbaum (2003) | Filatova et al. (2013) | Fish et al.

Balaena novaeangliae Borowski, 1781 , “de la nouvelle Angleterre,” (coast of New England, USA). Although there are no officially recognized subspecies, molecular evidence supports recognition of distinct populations in different ocean basins. Monotypic Distribution. Cosmopolitan, found in all oceans of the world, but with only rare incursions into the Mediterranean Sea. . Descriptive notes. Total length 1500-1700 cm; weight 30,000-34,000 kg. Adult female Humpback Whales are 40-70 cm longer than males. Mean lengths of physically mature males and females are 1300 cm and 1390 cm, respectively, while mean lengths at sexual maturity are 1180 cm and 1190 cm. The Humpback Whale is relatively shorter and stouter than any other species of rorquals and has a distinct countershading color pattern. Dorsal side of body is uniformly black, and ventral surface can be variably colored, ranging from black to white or mottled black and white. Some populations display an extension of white coloration up flanks. Underside of pectoral flipper typically is white, and color on dorsal surface can vary from all black in most Southern Hemisphere individuals to all white in most Northern Hemisphere individuals. Both lower lips are a uniform black and lack coloration asymmetry of the Fin Whale ( B. physalus ) and Omura’s Whale ( B. omurai ). Head of the Humpback Whale is relatively large, 28-30% oftotal body length. External surface of rostrum has a single, low, median ridge that is generally obscured by a series of fleshy knobs (dermal tubercles) that are spaced along it from blowholes to tip of snout. From above, lateral margin of rostrum of the Humpback Whale is slightly convex and intermediate in shape between the broadly U-shaped rostrum of the Blue Whale ( B. musculus ) and the more sharply pointed rostrum of the Fin Whale. In lateral view, rostrum of the Humpback Whale has a distinctly flattened profile. Dorsal fin is relatively small (up to 30 cm tall) and variably developed, ranging from low and blunt to sharply falcate. Dorsal fin is positioned slightly more than two-thirds the distance between tip of rostrum and flukes and is often located on a low fleshy hump. Pectoral flipper is remarkable in size, being the largest pectoral appendage of any known animal, living or extinct. Relatively slender pectoral flippers can reach up to 500 cm in length (25-33% of total body length) and have scalloped leading edges marked by fleshy tubercles that often are encrusted with barnacles (most commonly Coronula diadema and Conchoderma awritum). Position of individual tubercles corresponds to locations of bony joints within each flipper. As with all species of rorquals,flipper of the Humpback Whale has only four elongate digits (digit I is lost). The first and generally largest tubercle occurs at the position of the joint between radius and the first bone (metacarpal) of digit II, while the next two tubercles occur at the inter-phalangeal joints along digit II. The large fourth tubercle lies at the level of the terminus of digit II and distal to this, successive tubercles along flipper’s leading edge are located at the inter-phalangeal joints along digit III. Wind-tunnel experiments have shown that scalloped leading edges of flippers of Humpback Whales greatly reduce drag, increase lift, and generally improve performance and maneuverability of these impressive wing-like appendages. Caudal flukes of Humpback Whales are relatively large (compared with those of Sei Whales, B. borealis ), the width measuring c.27-33-5% oftotal body length. Long trailing edge of caudal flukes is distinctly serrated and marked by a deep median notch. Serration pattern and color on underside of flukes have been used extensively to identify individual Humpback Whales. As with other areas on body,tips of flukes of Humpback Whales are often encrusted with clusters of barnacles. Flukes typically are marked by numerous linear scars thought to result of unsuccessful attacks by Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Ventral groove blubber of the Humpback Whale is rather distinct and has only 12-36 relatively wide longitudinal pleats that extend from tip ofjaws to umbilicus. This numberis fewer than recorded for any other species of rorquals. Baleen apparatus of the Humpback Whale consists of individual plates that, like most rorquals, are short and broad, with an average length-to-width ratio typically c.2:1. Largest main baleen plates are 85-107 cm in length. Fringing baleen bristles of the Humpback Whale are intermediate in diameter between the Blue Whale (coarse) and the Sei Whale (fine). Baleen of the Humpback Whale is generally dark gray to black and often has white longitudinal streaks. Baleen laminae in front of rack may be all white to yellowish-white. Nevertheless, there is no consistent asymmetry in baleen coloration as occurs in the Fin Whale. Fringe bristle color of the Humpback Whale varies from dark gray or black to brown, or even white. Number of baleen laminae are 270-400 /side, with older individuals typically having more laminae. Humpback Whales are the slowest swimmers of the rorquals and although capable of short bursts of 25 km/h, their normal cruising speeds are 5-14 km/h. At sea, blowhole and low dorsal fin are often visible at the same time when an individual is surfacing. Blow is relatively low and bushy and generally up to 2-3 m high. When diving, Humpback Whales typically arch their backs high above the water and follow this with raised caudal flukes that display distinctive undersides. The Humpback Whale is well known for its “aquabatics” (in water displays) that can involve full breaches. Although Humpback Whales have many additional unique morphological features relative to other rorquals, molecular studies suggest that they are more closely related to Fin Whales than to other species of rorquals and do not represent a distinct evolutionary lineage separate from the Balaenoptera lineage. For this reason it is questionable whether continued use of the separate generic name, Megaptera , is appropriate. Habitat. Cosmopolitan distribution and found in all ocean basins. Like most species of rorquals, Humpback Whales undergo long seasonal migrations from low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds to high-latitude feeding grounds. Habitat preferences are difficult to define for highly mobile animals like the Humpback Whale, and they clearly vary with seasons (summer feeding grounds vs. winter breeding and birthing grounds). Management plans generally focus on areas that are currently known to seasonally support significant aggregations of Humpback Whales, such as birthing, resting, and feeding areas and segments of migratory routes. In winter breeding and birthing grounds, water depth appears to be an important limiting factor controlling social organization, with mother—offspring pairs showing a strong preference for waters less than 20 m deep. Such waters characteristically occur near offshore reef systems, islands, channels, and continental shelf areas. Distance from shore seems to be another limiting factor that influences group size and social organization. Larger groups of Humpback Whales are generally found farther from shore than smaller groups. Association of mother—offspring pairs and mother—offspring—escort trios in shallow water and near-shore locations on winter breeding grounds may also reflect a preference of receptive females or females with young for protection from rough seas. In summer feeding grounds, water temperature and position of continental shelf-slope breaks, ice-edge zones, oceanic fronts, eastern boundary currents, and areas of upwelling are limiting factors controlling distribution of nutrients, primary producers, primary consumers,first-order predators, and whales. Although difficult to clearly define as critical habitat, these areas are obviously important to the survival of the Humpback Whale. Food and Feeding. The diet of the Humpback Whale has been compared with that of the Fin Whale because both species are known to feed on marine invertebrates and vertebrates. This is especially true for populations of Humpback Whales in the Northern Hemisphere where studies of stomach contents of butchered individuals found distinct dietary patterns. Stomach contents often contained a single species of schooling fish, either herring (Chupeaspp.), capelin (Mallotus villosus), sand lance ( Ammodytes spp. ), or pollock (Pollachius spp.), but others had combinations of various vertebrate prey. Invertebrate prey species found in stomachs of Humpback Whales in the Northern Hemisphere included monotypic or polytypic aggregations of planktonic crustaceans (euphausids, mysids, or copepods) and benthonic species (amphipods). The apparent benthonic feeding strategy exhibited by some foraging Humpback Whales is rare for a species of rorqual and results in some individuals ingesting quantities of sand and gravel—also reported in stomach contents of butchered individuals. More recent studies using stable isotope analysis of biopsy dart samples, in combination with ship-based observation of feeding Humpback Whales in the Bering Sea, suggest a link between prey preference and habitat, with individuals tending to feed on fish in neritic areas and on plankton in deep oceanic waters. Unlike northern populations, Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere appear to feed almost exclusively on pelagic planktonic crustaceans, primarily krill (Euphausia superba). Like all species of rorquals, the Humpback Whale is a lunge-feeder but also has evolved an impressive repertoire of specialized feeding strategies. Perhaps the most unique of these is the practice of bubble-net feeding in which a single individual or, more often, a cooperative grouping of several individuals use bubbles to concentrate schooling fish. A typical cooperative “bubble-netting” event begins with individuals diving to a level below schooling fish, where one individual begins to swim in an ever-narrowing circle while blowing a ring of bubbles. As the curtain of bubbles rises toward the surface, reflections and noise from bubbles scare fish into a tighter grouping, which is made even more concentrated and compact by loud feeding calls made by another individual in the group. When the resulting bait ball is near the water’s surface, the whales ascend through the bubble net and lunge-feed, often breaking the surface in what some observers refer to as a single collective gulp. Such cooperative feeding groups of Humpback Whales are fluid in terms of membership and may number as many as 15 individuals. A variation of bubble netting, called lobtail feeding, has been documented in Humpback Whales feeding in the North Atlantic Ocean and involves an individual slapping the water's surface above a school of fish before diving to blow the bubble screen. Both behaviors are thought to help concentrate prey, and a study that tracked the spread of this unique foraging innovation over 27years concluded that lobtail feeding was being “culturally” transmitted through the population. Humpback Whales also herd prey by using their flukes, pectoral flippers, or both to disturb the water column. Humpback Whales often herd prey toward the water’s surface, which functions as an escape barrier to concentrate prey. There is also some evidence of other forms of cooperative hunting with individual groups of Humpback Whales feeding in formation or using acoustic calls to synchronize feeding lunges. Breeding. Reproductive biology of the Humpback Whale is probably the best known and most complex of any species of rorqual. Females and males reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age, although this figure may be closer to c.8 years in some areas. Female Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere reach sexual maturity at an average body length of 1160-1250 cm and males at 1110-1200 cm. Comparable measurements for the Northern Hemisphere are 1000-1200 cm and 1000-1150 cm, respectively. Reproductive cycle of the Humpback Whale, like most rorquals,is strongly seasonal and in tune with annual migration to low-latitude breeding and birthing grounds. Females come into estrus in winter, and males follow suit by undergoing spermatogenesis and increased testosterone production. Conception primarily occurs during respective austral and boreal winters, with a peak around September in the Southern Hemisphere and February in the Northern Hemisphere. Whaling data, however, suggest that ovulation and successful mating also may occur at other times of the year. Gestation typically lasts 11-11-5 months, with a single young born in the subsequent austral or boreal winter. Although twin fetuses have been reported from butchered pregnant females, live twin births have not been documented. Whaling data also suggest that embryos grow at an average rate of 17-35 cm/month. Young are ¢.390-450 cm in length at birth and weigh 900 kg. Nursing young consume a minimum of 43 kg of milk/day. Young are weaned at 6-10 months on summer feeding grounds when they are ¢.990 cm in length. This suggests an average neonatal growth rate of ¢.3 cm/day. Young often remain with their mothers for up to a year. Females reportedly give birth every 2-3 years, although several examples are known of individual females giving birth nearly annually. Postpartum estrus may occur on a regular basis in Humpback Whales, which may explain male escorts in close company with mother—offspring pairs late in the breeding season. If females were not in estrus, it is unlikely that males would be showing such interest in them. Sex ratio of neonates is essentially 1:1, which probably holds for much of the year except for periods when differential segregation of sexes or sexual classes occurs on or at the ends of the seasonal migrations. On breeding grounds, operational sex ratio is male dominated because males typically remain longer in the area and relative number of fertilizable females is reduced by presence of immature and postpartum females. Both sexes apparently are promiscuous to some extent because paternity tests of young from individually identifiable females show that over successive seasons a given female may mate with several different males. This level of promiscuity calls into question the characterization of the Humpback Whale’s breeding strategy as solely polygynous. Details of the complexity of Humpback Whale’s breeding behavior have emerged from sustained research conducted since the late 1970s in warm waters around the main Hawaiian Islands. Humpback Whales begin arriving by December (some arrive as early as September), with peak abundance in February-March. The last Humpback Whales have usually departed by May, although some individuals remain as late as June in some years. Research suggests that the Humpback Whale practices a mainly polygynous mating system that grossly resembles a lek (males gathering to attract females). Although this mating system does not involve establishment of defensible territories, male Humpback Whales do exhibit aggressive competitive behaviors that include bubble screens, where a whale will forcefully blow bubbles from his blowholes; rear-body thrashing, where a whale throws his tail and peduncle out of the water before smashing it down sideways on the surface; horizontal tail slashing, where whales slash their tails horizontally through the water; and lobtailing, where a whale raises his flukes above the water before bringing them down to forcefully slap the surface. There are times when these aggressive behaviors result in actual physical contact that can lead to injury and,in rare instances, death. Males are also known to form temporary “coalitions” to drive away males in other competitive groups. Besides these male-male competition behaviors, Humpback Whales are also known to perform courtship behaviors that include rubbing or touching one another with their pectoral flippers; “flippering,” where whales raise their pectoral flippers out of the water and slap the surface; head-up displays, where whales horizontally elevate their heads above the surface and then slowly sink without swimming forward; vertical tail extensions, where whales vertically lift their tails out of the water; and escorting, where adult males join with a solitary or, more frequently, a female and her offspring. Vocalization, involving singing males, also plays an important role on the breeding grounds. Individual songs may last for 10-20 minutes, and some solo “performances” that repeat the song over and over may last for several hours or even days. All males in a given area basically sing the same, highly structured song, which consists of several tonal themes or “verses” that are sung in a generally consistent order. The performance appears to be highly ritualized and singers typically assume a motionless posture with head down, tail up, and flukes 7-15 m below the water’s surface. Over the course of the breeding season, the song in a given area evolves as new “verses” are added here and there. Within the context of a modified lek mating system, the song (vocal display) of singing males has been viewed as driven by sexual selection to attract females or dissuade competing males. This hypothesis suggests that the song provides some indication of the fitness of the singer. Although only adult male Humpback Whales sing, males and females produce a variety of different types of non-song vocalizations on breeding (and feeding) grounds and during migration. Other than mother—offspring pairs, the most stable social group among Humpback Whales on breeding grounds is a mother—offspring pair with an adult male escort. This group may remain together for hours or even days, and the escorting male typically remains within a body length of the female and appears to synchronize his breathing and dive patterns with hers. There are also tactile interactions where the male will touch the female with his pectoral flippers. Studies in the Hawaiian breeding grounds of the Humpback Whale suggest that as many as 86% of mother—offspring pairs in a given season have been accompanied by an adult male escort. These interactions generally occur later in the breeding season after some of the postpartum females have come into estrus. Studies of growth layers formed in wax plugs taken from external ear canals of dead Humpback Whales suggest that they may live up to 48 years. Activity patterns. Daily activity patterns have been described for Humpback Whales on summer feeding grounds in both hemispheres and consist of foraging individuals generally following the diel movements cycle of their prey (deep water during the day and shallow water at night). Like most species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Humpback Whales are primarily related to migration between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding and birthing grounds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Migratory patterns, breeding and feeding areas, and population structure of the Humpback Whale are probably better known than for any other species of rorquals. A number of factors combine to provide this increased level of understanding including its general near-shore migratory routes; its preference for breeding areas near islands, banks, and reefs; and its preference for feeding areas near shelf-slope breaks, regional marine embayments, or channels. Slower swimming speed of Humpback Whales and its affinity for exuberant aquabatics make it easier to study directly. The Humpback Whale holds the record for the longest known migration of any mammal. In support of this claim is the report of a group of seven whales (including a young) that traveled from the tropical North Pacific breeding and birthing area off Costa Rica and Panama to feeding grounds around Antarctica, a distance of more than 8300 km. Another example of long distance migration involves the well-defined migration route of Humpback Whales between summer feeding grounds in Alaskan waters and winter breeding and birthing grounds in warm waters around Hawaii, a distance of ¢.4830 km. There are several accounts of photo-identified individuals completing this crossing in as few as 36 days, which translates to an average swimming speed of 134 km/day or an average of 5:6 km/h. In the North Pacific Ocean, Humpback Whales feed during summer in waters from the Chukchi Sea south to Honshu in the west and southern California in the east. Their winter migration takes them to three primary breeding and birthing grounds: western subtropical to tropical waters off southern China, Taiwan, and the Philippines east to the Marshall Islands; waters around the main oceanic islands of the Hawaiian archipelago; and warm waters off the southern tip of Baja California, the Revillagigedo Islands, and adjacent mainland Mexico. In the North Atlantic Ocean, Humpback Whales feed during boreal summer in waters as far north as the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, and Barents Sea, and as far south as the Gulf of Maine in the west and Ireland in the east. Primary boreal winter migration routes in the North Atlantic Ocean take Humpback Whales to breeding and birthing grounds in the West Indies around Hispaniola (19° N). A small number of Humpback Whales also visit breeding grounds around the Cape Verde Islands (15°-17° N). The likelihood of at least a third, currently unknown, breeding and birthing area in the North Atlantic Ocean is suggested by genetic evidence. The population of Humpback Whales in the northern Indian Ocean is blocked from migrating northward during boreal winter by the Eurasian landmass and consequently remains year-round in warm waters of this region from the Gulf of Aden through the Arabian Sea and into the Bay of Bengal. Various populations of Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere spend austral summer feeding in highly productive waters south of the Antarctic Convergence to edge of the pack ice around Antarctica. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizessix latitudinally arranged feeding areas in the Southern Ocean that are visited by southward migrating Humpback Whales beginning in November, reaching a peak in January, and departing entirely by May. During austral winter migration, groups of Humpback Whales move north out of the Southern Ocean to seven primary breeding and birthing grounds that include waters of the western South Atlantic Ocean (coastal waters of Brazil from Natal to Cabo Frio and the Abrolhos Banks), the eastern South Atlantic Ocean (coastal waters from the Gulf of Guinea south to Cape Town), the south-western Indian Ocean (coastal waters of Mozambique and Madagascar), the south-eastern Indian Ocean (coastal waters of north-western Australia), the western South Pacific Ocean (the Coral Sea and tropical waters around Vanuatu, Fiji, and Tonga), the central South Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia and the Cook Islands), and the eastern South Pacific Ocean (Gulf of Panama south to the Gulf of Guyaquil and the Galapagos Islands). Interestingly, breeding grounds in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean and eastern South Pacific Ocean extend into tropical waters north of the Equator—a pattern that is probably related to the strong eastern boundary currents in these areas. Unlike other species of rorquals, Humpback Whales have been the focus of rather intensive fieldwork to determine population structure on feeding and breeding grounds. From this work,it appears that populations of Humpback Whale in the Northern Hemisphere typically come together on common breeding grounds but disperse into separate loosely affiliated groups as they leave for their summer feeding grounds. These migrating subpopulations show a high degree of genetic structure that suggests matrilineal fidelity to particular feeding grounds. During migration, social organization of individual groupsis quite fluid in terms of membership, with individualsjoining and leaving generally small groups on a somewhat regular basis. Population structure on the more communal feeding grounds, however, is probably diffuse, a possible result of male-mediated gene flow among subpopulations arriving from different feeding grounds. Feeding associations composed of multiple individuals tend to be temporary and dependent on constantly varying prey-patch size. Nevertheless, certain feeding associations (e.g. Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine) have been reported to be more stable and to last over most of the feeding season. Vocalization in Humpback Whales is a well-known social aspect of their behavior, especially relatively complex songs sung by solitary males on winter breeding grounds. Other forms of vocalization are known, and both males and females have been reported to make calls on summer feeding grounds or during annual migrations. As a form of communication among Humpback Whales, these calls or vocal sounds appear to have specific functions and, in some cases, are restricted to particular social groups. For example, vocal sounds termed “wops” seem to represent a contact call between a mother and her offspring, while “thwops” are thought to be a more general contact call among individuals of no particular gender or age group. A series of grunts or grunt trains has been associated with comingling of groups. Other vocal sounds produced by Humpback Whales include groans, snorts, “crys,” barks, and underwater blows or bubble bursts. Another form of social sounds used by Humpback Whales in communication are surface generated sounds such as those produced by breaching, which appears to communicate location and body size when an individual is leaving or joining a group, or pectoral slapping, which may be a signal from females to nearby males. These surface-generated sounds also increase in frequency when whales are excited and,at times, may represent no more than simple play. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The subpopulations of Humpback Whales in the Arabian Sea and Oceania are listed as Endangered. This charismatic rorqual species has been assigned a Least Concern category primarily because of the impressive increase in global populations that has occurred since intensive commercial overexploitation ended. Nevertheless, there are certain stocks that continue to remain at low population levels and,if considered on their own, would be assigned to a more threatened status. Causes of earlier global population decline are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. Shore-based whaling of Humpback Whales began in the 17"" century in the North Atlantic Ocean and increased in lethal effect with the advent of pelagic factory whaling. During 10years in the early 20"" century (1904-1913), ¢.19,986 Humpback Whales were killed in waters around South Georgia Island, while a little more than ten years later (1926-1935), the number killed declined to only 303 individuals in the same area. This sharp decline demonstrated the unsustainable nature of commercial exploitation of the Humpback Whale and other species of rorquals that was occurring at this time. The most recent population estimate for Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean from the West Indies breeding and birthing grounds in 1992-1993 was 10,752 individuals, which combined with photoidentification of 72 individuals in the Cape Verde Islands area provided a metric for computing annual rate of increase at 3-1%. Estimates of subpopulations of Humpback Whales on breeding grounds in the eastern North Pacific Ocean off Mexico in 2008 were 6000-7000 individuals, while 2008 estimates for the subpopulation in the western North Pacific Ocean on winter grounds south ofJapan was substantially less at 938-1107 individuals. Breeding grounds around the Hawaiian Islands appear to support the largest subpopulation of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific Ocean (7120-10,425 individuals). Analysis of 1991-1993 population data for the entire North Pacific Ocean suggests a rate of increase of 4-:9% /year. The year-round resident population of Humpback Whales in the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea) is probably the most threatened and, based on photo-identification data, consists ofless than 60 individuals. Populations of Humpback Whales have been relatively well studied in the Southern Hemisphere where as many as seven major breeding stocks are recognized by the IWC. Population assessments have only been completed for three of these stocks (south-western Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, south-eastern Indian Ocean off north-western Australia, and south-eastern Pacific Ocean off Ecuador, Columbia, and Panama), and this work serves as a useful measure of current status of Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere. The subpopulation in the south-western Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, which had been reduced to only a few hundred individuals by the mid-1960s, has made a strong recovery to a population on winter breeding grounds of ¢.6250 individuals based on 2002-2005 data. The population in the south-eastern Indian Ocean has also rebounded from a pre-moratorium level of ¢.1000 individuals to 10,032 individuals in 1999. Humpback Whales on breeding grounds of the southeastern Pacific Ocean were estimated at ¢.2917 individuals in 2003-2004. The current estimate of populations of Humpback Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is ¢.36,400 individuals. As with other species of rorquals, the international moratorium on commercial whaling that began in 1986 represents the primary conservation measure for insuring survival of the Humpback Whale. Ongoing threats are essentially the same as for other species of rorquals and include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (commercial shipping noise and whale watching harassment), habitat decline and interference, aboriginal whaling, and “scientific research.” In the latter case,Japan has issued scientific permits for its whaling fleet to engage in lethal sampling of Humpback Whales and has set an annual catch of 50 individuals.

Adult female Blue Whales are larger than males and represent the largest animals, past and present, to ever live on Earth. Total body length and weight estimates are up to 3260 cm and 145,000 kg for the “Antarctic Blue Whale” (B. m. intermedia), 2800 cm and 113,000 kg for the “Northern Blue Whale” (B. m. musculus ), and 2300 cm and 69,000 kg for the “Pygmy Blue Whale” (B. m. brevicauda). Although older scientific literature reports total body lengths of up to 3300 cm for Antarctic Blue Whales, these measurements are questionable because they were taken by nonstandard methods at whaling stations. The same can be said for body weights of 190,000 kg in some reports. Computing accurate weights of animals as large as Blue Whales is a challenge, and because an entire individual cannot be weighed at the same time, the most accurate estimates of weights have been made at whaling stations or onboard factory whaling ships where the different parts of a dead whale are weighed separately and then totaled. This method, however, also has problems because weight of body fluids, especially blood,is not included in the calculation. In general, head of the Blue Whale is uniformly gray, while body is generally light bluish-gray with extensive gray-to-grayish white mottling. Ventral surface is lighter gray to yellowish-white. Pectoral flippers are generally bluish-gray above and whitish below, with a thin white border. Caudal flukes are light bluish gray above and below, although a radial pattern of pale striations on undersurface of flukes is often present and has been used to identify different groups of individuals. In cold, high-latitude polar waters, some foraging Blue Whales have a yellow-green—to—brown hue during summer, which is caused by a surface film of diatoms (Cocconeis ceticola). This diatom film is responsible for the name “sulfur-bottom whale,” a term that is variably applied to Blue Whales. A submerged individual seen from the deck of a ship appears to be slate gray on cloudy days and silvery or turquoise blue on sunny days. Head is 22-27% of total body length. External surface of head has a single, prominent median rostral ridge, extending from blowholes to tip of rostrum. A prominent, fleshy “splash guard” is immediately in front of blowholes. This splash guard expands impressively when an individual is about to take a breath, and the blow that follows is typically tall, slender, and distinctly vertical (9-12 m high). Lateral margin of rostrum is broadly rounded and U-shaped as viewed from above, in contrast to the more sharply triangular rostra of other rorquals such as the Fin Whale ( B. physalus ) and the Sei Whale ( B. borealis ). In lateral view, rostrum of the Blue Whale has a distinctly flattened profile. Dorsal fin is proportionally tiny (¢.35 cm) compared with other species of rorquals and is located well posterior on body, approximately three-quarters of the body length from tip of rostrum. Shape of dorsal fin varies from distinctly triangular to broadly rounded or smoothly falcate. Pectoral flippers are relatively long (c.15% of body length), slender, and bluntly pointed, with an anteriorly convex leading edge. As with all species of rorquals, there are only four elongate digits in the flipper (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes are broad (c.24% of body length) and can measure up to 700 cm across, with straight-to-slightly sinuous trailing edges marked by median notches. Fluke tips are distinctly pointed. Ventral groove blubber has 55-88 pleats that extend from chin to just posterior of umbilicus. Baleen plates are surprisingly thin for their length (up to 100 cm) and uniformly black, with numerous, coarse black bristles extending from lingual margins. Baleen laminae number 270-395/side or rack. Individual baleen laminae are broadly triangular and relatively broad compared with those in Fin Whales. When observed at sea, Blue Whales slowly rise to the surface, first showing head and blowholes, then their broad back, and finally their diminutive dorsal fin. Unlike Fin Whales, Blue Whales sometimes raise their flukes above the water when sounding.","Epipelagic regions of all ocean basins, except the Arctic, and sometimes in neritic coastal areas of continental shelves. Blue Whales occur in coastal areas of continental shelves such as the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Gulf of California, and Southern California Bight and in submerged oceanic plateaus and volcanoes (Madagascar Plateau, Crozet Plateau, and Kerguelen Plateau). Habitat preferences of Blue Whales are related to feeding grounds, which appear to be localized and the consequence of strong oceanographic interactions between currents and seafloor topographic features or convergence of surface currents that form cyclonic circulation and a shallow thermocline. This pattern is reflected in the population of Blue Whales that summers in the eastern North Pacific Ocean off central California, where individuals appear to prefer coastal habitats marked by steep submarine topographic features that enhance upwelling (shelfsslope break, borderland basin margins, etc.). These Blue Whales feed almost exclusively on krill during boreal summer and early autumn as far north as the Farallon Islands and Monterey Bay before moving south to waters around the Channel Islands to continue feeding during autumn. During boreal winter, individuals move further south into the Gulf of California and continue to feed on krill in protected waters of Bahia de Loreto. Some members of this population are even reported to migrate during boreal winter to the Costa Rica Dome (10° N) in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, where upwelling and a shallow thermocline result from a combination of cyclonic surface current circulation and large-scale wind patterns. In contrast, austral summer foraging habitat of the Blue Whale in high-latitude regions of the Southern Ocean is generally associated with areas of sharp oceanographic density interfaces, such as those caused by convergence of cold, northward flowing surface waters from Antarctica and relatively warmer surface waters of the subantarctic region (Antarctic Convergence). Whaling records indicate that the neritic waters off the south-western coast of South Africa were formerly frequented by Blue Whales during austral winter.","Information on diets of Blue Whales is primarily based on studies of stomach contents from individuals killed by whalers. In recent years, however, at-sea collection of feces from Blue Whale has also provided reliable dietary information. Mortality-based dietary studies indicate that Blue Whales are generally stenophagous, feeding almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill). Other species of meso-zooplankton and larger nektonic animals are occasionally eaten, but these are probably unintentionally ingested. Antarctic Blue Whales primarily consume Euphausia superba, a relatively large species of krill reaching up to 6 cm in length with an average mass of c.1 g. Pygmy Blue Whales primarily consume E. vallentini, a smaller species of krill measuring 1.3-2.8 cm. Blue Whales in the North Pacific Ocean feed on several different species of euphausiids including E. pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, 1. longipes, and Nematoscelis megalops, but they also eat copepods (Calanus spp.). Blue Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean also eat a variety of different euphausiids including 7. inermis, T raschii, and Meganyctiphanes norvegica, but they also feed on copepods (Temora longicornis). It has been estimated that a feeding Blue Whale consumes up to 6000 kg ofkrill in a single day. Blue Whales, like all species of rorquals, are lunge feeders, and information on their feeding behavior from direct observations and deployment of temporary digital tags on foraging individuals provide an impressive array of data including dive depth, roll, pitch, and even acceleration. Such studies show that Blue Whales feed at water depths of up to 100 m during daytime and follow diel vertical movements of prey to feed at shallower depths up to the surface during the night. One study found that foraging dives of Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence had higher feeding rates during the night and occurred at water depths typically less than 20 m. The feeding rate at night averaged one feeding lunge every 2-1 minutes vs. one every 4-2 minutes during the day. Daytime dives were generally of longer duration (up to 23 minutes), and individuals dove to greater depths (up to 134 m). Maximum number of lunges in a single dive was 15. Not all daytime dives, however, were deep, and some individuals preferred to forage at shallower depths in areas where topographic or oceanographic conditions resulted in prey aggregating near the water’s surface. Surface lunges were also noted and, as observed elsewhere, often involved individuals feeding on dense surface patches of krill while swimming on their sides with one flipper and parts of their flukes out of the water. At a broader ecological scale, it is interesting to note that krill generally have a patchy distribution in pelagic ecosystems and occur in areas of ephemeral, high primary productivity such as regions of ocean current divergences and convergences and regions of localized upwelling, fronts, and eddies. Localized aggregations of krill also occur in areas where strong interactions between currents and topographic features of the seafloor result in predictable areas of high primary productivity of phytoplankton. To take advantage of these ephemeral high-productivity hotspots, epipelagic mesopredators like Blue Whales must range over long distances. In viewing Blue Whales as “capital” breeders, researches have traditionally thought that the annual migration cycle of the Blue Whale is similar to that of other species of rorquals, with whales feeding at high latitudes (either austral or boreal depending on the hemisphere) during summer and fasting at low latitudes during winter, while giving birth and breeding. Several recent studies, however, suggest that Blue Whales likely continue to feed during winter, given the clustering of Blue Whales in areas with locally dense concentrations of krill and other planktonic crustaceans at this time of year. This behavior may be a consequence ofthe extremely large size of Blue Whales and an inability on the part of individuals to maintain sufficient energy stores through a long winterfast.","Not a great deal is known about breeding behavior of Blue Whales except that such activities are generally synchronized with the annual migration cycle. In this scheme, breeding typically occurs during winter—austral winter in the Southern Hemisphere and boreal winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, reproductive seasons for northern and southern populations are c.6 months out of phase, which suggests an allopatric condition that leaves little opportunity for interbreeding among populations from opposite hemispheres. Blue Whales have a 2year interbirth interval characterized by a 10-12month gestation, a 6—7month lactation period, and a 6-7month anestrous. Shipboard observations of Northern Blue Whales near the Costa Rica Dome in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have documented neonates and mothers during boreal winter, an indication that births are occurring at least nearby. In the same waters, trios of adult Blue Whales displaying boisterous behavior suggest that courtship and mating are also taking place. Newborn Blue Whales typically are 600-700 cm long and weigh ¢.2000-3000 kg. Nursing young gain ¢.91 kg/day for their first year of life, and young are weaned when they are ¢.1600 cm long and 6-7 months old. Yearlings continue to grow at an average rate of 100-200 cm/year until they reach sexual maturity at c.8-10 years of age. Antarctic Blue Whales reach sexual maturity at ¢.2300 cm in males and ¢.2400 cm in females. Pygmy Blue Whales reach sexual maturity at ¢.1800 cm in males and ¢.1920 cm in females. Physical maturity in Pygmy Blue Whalesis reached at a length of ¢.2050 cm in males and ¢.2180 cm in females; in Antarctic Blue Whales, it is reached at ¢.2410 cm in males and ¢.2620 cm in females. Although some Blue Whales may live up to 80 years, average longevity of Antarctic Blue Whales is probably slightly greater than 65 years. On following pages: 6. Omura’s Whale ( Balaenoptera omurai ); 7. Fin Whale ( Balaenoptera physalus ); 8. Humpback Whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ).","Daily activity patterns of Blue Whales have been described on summer feeding grounds in both hemispheres and consist of foraging individuals generally following diel movements of their prey (deep water during day and shallow water at night). Perhaps more than other species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Blue Whales are ratherstrictly related to migration between high-latitude summer feeding grounds and low-latitude winter breeding and birthing grounds.","Worldwide, Blue Whales have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring in all major ocean basins except the Arctic. Precise information on migration routes and home ranges is limited and comes from a variety of data sources including historical whaling records, stranding records, and results of modern sighting and acoustic surveys. Data for some subspecies and populations are more extensive than for others, and general biogeographic patterns have undoubtedly been altered by intense, worldwide exploitation of Blue Whales that occurred from 1904 to 1973. Extremely depleted populations of Antarctic Blue Whales retain a nearly circumpolar distribution in Antarctic waters during austral summer and early autumn feeding season in November—March. During this period, their distribution appears to be strongly linked to latitude, with feeding individuals concentrated along latitudinal bands south of 60° S (generally south of the Antarctic Polar Front). In contrast, distribution of Antarctic Blue Whales during austral winter seems to be more clustered, localized, and compressed along low-latitude continental margins and offshore submerged volcanic platforms in areas associated with upwelling. Historical whaling records suggest that during austral winter, Antarctic Blue Whales formerly were concentrated in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Africa from South Africa to DR Congo, with their distribution likely linked to waters of high primary and secondary production associated with the upwelling system of the north-flowing Benguela Current. A similar distribution of Blue Whales is proposed in the eastern South Pacific Ocean off Chile and Peru. Although clearly most Antarctic Blue Whales migrate into low latitudes during austral winter,it is not certain if they all do. In fact a close examination of whaling records suggests that there may have been a resident population of Antarctic Blue Whales in and around South Georgia Island (54° S) that routinely overwintered in the high-productivity waters surrounding this oceanic island. Migratory patterns of Pygmy Blue Whales are poorly known. It appears, however, based on historical whaling records and sighting and acoustic surveys, that the population of these whales in the south-western Indian Ocean south of Madagascar moves southward during austral winter and then disperses longitudinally across the subantarctic region from Africa to Australia. Evidence indicates that some of these individuals may migrate northward to Diego Garcia (6° S) in the central Indian Ocean during austral winter. Additional evidence, however, suggests occurrence of a year-round resident population of Pygmy Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean, another year-round resident population off southern Madagascar, and a possible third year-round resident population in waters around Australia and New Zealand. In the Northern Hemisphere, different populations of Blue Whales have been recognized in eastern and western parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The western North Atlantic population of Blue Whales ranges from Greenland (60-70° N) in boreal summerto South Carolina (34° N) in winter, while the eastern population has its boreal summer range as far north as the Barents Sea and Svalbard (80° N) and winters in the region around the Cape Verde Islands (15° N). The population of Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific Ocean appears to spend boreal winter in waters off Baja California (25° N), south to the Costa Rica Dome (10° N), and in the summer,it ranges north to the Aleutian Islands (55° N), with some resident individuals remaining off the central California coast (34° N). The population of Blue Whales in the western North Pacific Ocean spends boreal summer feeding in waters off Kamchatka and the Kuriles Islands (45-60° N) and migrates south in winter to the area south ofJapan around the Bonin Islands (27° N). Social structure of Blue Whales is largely unknown. Most observations at sea are solitary individuals or pairs. Aggregations of 50 or more individuals have been reported on summer feeding grounds, but these concentrations are most likely because of the high productivity of polar seas. With the advent of new technologies, such as digital tagging,satellite tracking, and biopsy sampling of living whales, the opportunity for answering a number of basic questions concerning population structure and identity of Blue Whales may be at hand. Another method potentially useful in understanding population structure involves acoustic studies of vocal sounds of Blue Whales, which may represent the most powerful (188 dB) and lowest frequency (16—-100 Hz) sounds produced by animals in nature. These vocal sounds can be classified as either songs or calls, with songs representing a limited number of stereotypic sound types produced in a regular sequence and forming a recognizable pattern, while calls are sounds consisting of individual short-lived vocalizations produced at irregular intervals or as reciprocal calls and counter-calls between two or more individuals. Songs of Blue Whales can be detected for hundreds and perhaps even thousands of kilometers, and researchers have distinguished nine song types worldwide, each associated with a different geographical region. Four song types are recognized in the Pacific Ocean, at least three in the Indian Ocean, and one each in the Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean. These song types, some of which have remained stable for more than 30 years, probably reflect distinct populations and thus serve as another potential means for characterizing population structure. Although functions of Blue Whale songs are currently unknown,it is likely that, at a minimum, they serve as social signals between interacting individuals.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Antarctic Blue Whaleis listed as Critically Endangered and the Pygmy Blue Whale as Data Deficient. Causes of population decline are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. During the first one-half of the 20"" century, more than 330,000 Antarctic Blue Whales were killed in the Southern Ocean alone. Another 13,000 Pygmy Blue Whales were reported killed in the Southern Hemisphere. Whaling records for the Northern Hemisphere document kills of at least 11,000 Northern Blue Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean and 9500 in the North Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that the pre-exploitation population of the Antarctic Blue Whale was ¢.239,000 individuals and at the peak of what can be termed the exploitation bottleneck, the population had been reduced to as few as 400 individuals. Eventually, the unsustainable nature of this overexploitation was realized, and beginning in 1939, Blue Whales in parts of the Southern Hemisphere were finally afforded international protection from hunting. This move was followed by complete protection in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1955, protection of all remaining Blue Whales in the Antarctic Ocean in 1965, and protection in the North Pacific Ocean in 1966. Thirty years later, in 1996, it was estimated that the population of Antarctic Blue Whales had recovered to c.1700 individuals, with a proposed rate of increase of 7-:3% /year. Population estimates for the Pygmy Blue Whale are uncertain, but they suggest a minimum of 424 whales in the Southern Indian Ocean. Sizes of other Southern Hemisphere populations are unknown, although some data suggest as many as 1000 Blue Whales may now live in the South Pacific Ocean. Populations of Northern Blue Whales in the North Atlantic are thought to be recovering at a rate of 5-2% /year, and based on 2004 and 2006 data, stand at 1000-2000 individuals in the central North Atlantic Ocean and c.400 in the western North Atlantic Ocean, respectively. Northern Blue Whales are still rare in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, where they have been largely extirpated from the site of their initial commercial exploitation. In the North Pacific Ocean, it is estimated that the population (based on 2004 data) is ¢.3000 Northern Blue Whales. Although size of the current global population of Blue Whales is uncertain, a figure of 10,000-25,000 seems reasonable. If correct, this suggests a population decline of 89-97% from the estimated 1911 world population. Today, protected from all types of commercial exploitation, populations of Blue Whale continue to increase, bringing this largest of all mammals back from the brink of extinction. Ongoing threats include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (shipping traffic noise), and habitat decline. Additional threats from climate change and potential loss of prey base and shifts in critical habitat are of unknown impact to the recovery of populations of Blue Whales.","Blyth (1859) | Branch, Abubaker et al.

Balaena musculus Linnaeus, 1758 , “Habitat in mari Scotico” (Scotland, United Kingdom). The type specimen was stranded in the Firth of Forth, a fjord on the eastern coast of Scotland in the North Sea. A possible fourth subspecies, the “Northern Indian Ocean Blue Whale” ( indica ) named by Blyth in 1859, is recognized by some workers. Genetic support for recognition of distinct subspecies of Blue Whales currently is relatively weak. Three subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. B.m.musculusLinnaeus,1758—NAtlanticandNPacific. B.m.brevicaudaIchihara,1966—IndianOceanandSWSouthPacificaroundAustralia. B. m. intermedia Burmeister, 1871 — Southern Ocean. Descriptive notes. Total length 3170-3260 cm; weight 113,000-150,000 kg. Adult female Blue Whales are larger than males and represent the largest animals, past and present, to ever live on Earth. Total body length and weight estimates are up to 3260 cm and 145,000 kg for the “Antarctic Blue Whale” (B. m. intermedia), 2800 cm and 113,000 kg for the “Northern Blue Whale” (B. m. musculus ), and 2300 cm and 69,000 kg for the “Pygmy Blue Whale” (B. m. brevicauda). Although older scientific literature reports total body lengths of up to 3300 cm for Antarctic Blue Whales, these measurements are questionable because they were taken by nonstandard methods at whaling stations. The same can be said for body weights of 190,000 kg in some reports. Computing accurate weights of animals as large as Blue Whales is a challenge, and because an entire individual cannot be weighed at the same time, the most accurate estimates of weights have been made at whaling stations or onboard factory whaling ships where the different parts of a dead whale are weighed separately and then totaled. This method, however, also has problems because weight of body fluids, especially blood,is not included in the calculation. In general, head of the Blue Whale is uniformly gray, while body is generally light bluish-gray with extensive gray-to-grayish white mottling. Ventral surface is lighter gray to yellowish-white. Pectoral flippers are generally bluish-gray above and whitish below, with a thin white border. Caudal flukes are light bluish gray above and below, although a radial pattern of pale striations on undersurface of flukes is often present and has been used to identify different groups of individuals. In cold, high-latitude polar waters, some foraging Blue Whales have a yellow-green—to—brown hue during summer, which is caused by a surface film of diatoms (Cocconeis ceticola). This diatom film is responsible for the name “sulfur-bottom whale,” a term that is variably applied to Blue Whales. A submerged individual seen from the deck of a ship appears to be slate gray on cloudy days and silvery or turquoise blue on sunny days. Head is 22-27% of total body length. External surface of head has a single, prominent median rostral ridge, extending from blowholes to tip of rostrum. A prominent, fleshy “splash guard” is immediately in front of blowholes. This splash guard expands impressively when an individual is about to take a breath, and the blow that follows is typically tall, slender, and distinctly vertical (9-12 m high). Lateral margin of rostrum is broadly rounded and U-shaped as viewed from above, in contrast to the more sharply triangular rostra of other rorquals such as the Fin Whale ( B. physalus ) and the Sei Whale ( B. borealis ). In lateral view, rostrum of the Blue Whale has a distinctly flattened profile. Dorsal fin is proportionally tiny (¢.35 cm) compared with other species of rorquals and is located well posterior on body, approximately three-quarters of the body length from tip of rostrum. Shape of dorsal fin varies from distinctly triangular to broadly rounded or smoothly falcate. Pectoral flippers are relatively long (c.15% of body length), slender, and bluntly pointed, with an anteriorly convex leading edge. As with all species of rorquals, there are only four elongate digits in the flipper (digit I is lost). Caudal flukes are broad (c.24% of body length) and can measure up to 700 cm across, with straight-to-slightly sinuous trailing edges marked by median notches. Fluke tips are distinctly pointed. Ventral groove blubber has 55-88 pleats that extend from chin to just posterior of umbilicus. Baleen plates are surprisingly thin for their length (up to 100 cm) and uniformly black, with numerous, coarse black bristles extending from lingual margins. Baleen laminae number 270-395/side or rack. Individual baleen laminae are broadly triangular and relatively broad compared with those in Fin Whales. When observed at sea, Blue Whales slowly rise to the surface, first showing head and blowholes, then their broad back, and finally their diminutive dorsal fin. Unlike Fin Whales, Blue Whales sometimes raise their flukes above the water when sounding. Habitat. Epipelagic regions of all ocean basins, except the Arctic, and sometimes in neritic coastal areas of continental shelves. Blue Whales occur in coastal areas of continental shelves such as the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Gulf of California, and Southern California Bight and in submerged oceanic plateaus and volcanoes (Madagascar Plateau, Crozet Plateau, and Kerguelen Plateau). Habitat preferences of Blue Whales are related to feeding grounds, which appear to be localized and the consequence of strong oceanographic interactions between currents and seafloor topographic features or convergence of surface currents that form cyclonic circulation and a shallow thermocline. This pattern is reflected in the population of Blue Whales that summers in the eastern North Pacific Ocean off central California, where individuals appear to prefer coastal habitats marked by steep submarine topographic features that enhance upwelling (shelfsslope break, borderland basin margins, etc.). These Blue Whales feed almost exclusively on krill during boreal summer and early autumn as far north as the Farallon Islands and Monterey Bay before moving south to waters around the Channel Islands to continue feeding during autumn. During boreal winter, individuals move further south into the Gulf of California and continue to feed on krill in protected waters of Bahia de Loreto. Some members of this population are even reported to migrate during boreal winter to the Costa Rica Dome (10° N) in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, where upwelling and a shallow thermocline result from a combination of cyclonic surface current circulation and large-scale wind patterns. In contrast, austral summer foraging habitat of the Blue Whale in high-latitude regions of the Southern Ocean is generally associated with areas of sharp oceanographic density interfaces, such as those caused by convergence of cold, northward flowing surface waters from Antarctica and relatively warmer surface waters of the subantarctic region (Antarctic Convergence). Whaling records indicate that the neritic waters off the south-western coast of South Africa were formerly frequented by Blue Whales during austral winter. Food and Feeding. Information on diets of Blue Whales is primarily based on studies of stomach contents from individuals killed by whalers. In recent years, however, at-sea collection of feces from Blue Whale has also provided reliable dietary information. Mortality-based dietary studies indicate that Blue Whales are generally stenophagous, feeding almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill). Other species of meso-zooplankton and larger nektonic animals are occasionally eaten, but these are probably unintentionally ingested. Antarctic Blue Whales primarily consume Euphausia superba, a relatively large species of krill reaching up to 6 cm in length with an average mass of c.1 g. Pygmy Blue Whales primarily consume E. vallentini, a smaller species of krill measuring 1.3-2.8 cm. Blue Whales in the North Pacific Ocean feed on several different species of euphausiids including E. pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, 1. longipes, and Nematoscelis megalops, but they also eat copepods (Calanus spp.). Blue Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean also eat a variety of different euphausiids including 7. inermis, T raschii, and Meganyctiphanes norvegica, but they also feed on copepods (Temora longicornis). It has been estimated that a feeding Blue Whale consumes up to 6000 kg ofkrill in a single day. Blue Whales, like all species of rorquals, are lunge feeders, and information on their feeding behavior from direct observations and deployment of temporary digital tags on foraging individuals provide an impressive array of data including dive depth, roll, pitch, and even acceleration. Such studies show that Blue Whales feed at water depths of up to 100 m during daytime and follow diel vertical movements of prey to feed at shallower depths up to the surface during the night. One study found that foraging dives of Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence had higher feeding rates during the night and occurred at water depths typically less than 20 m. The feeding rate at night averaged one feeding lunge every 2-1 minutes vs. one every 4-2 minutes during the day. Daytime dives were generally of longer duration (up to 23 minutes), and individuals dove to greater depths (up to 134 m). Maximum number of lunges in a single dive was 15. Not all daytime dives, however, were deep, and some individuals preferred to forage at shallower depths in areas where topographic or oceanographic conditions resulted in prey aggregating near the water’s surface. Surface lunges were also noted and, as observed elsewhere, often involved individuals feeding on dense surface patches of krill while swimming on their sides with one flipper and parts of their flukes out of the water. At a broader ecological scale, it is interesting to note that krill generally have a patchy distribution in pelagic ecosystems and occur in areas of ephemeral, high primary productivity such as regions of ocean current divergences and convergences and regions of localized upwelling, fronts, and eddies. Localized aggregations of krill also occur in areas where strong interactions between currents and topographic features of the seafloor result in predictable areas of high primary productivity of phytoplankton. To take advantage of these ephemeral high-productivity hotspots, epipelagic mesopredators like Blue Whales must range over long distances. In viewing Blue Whales as “capital” breeders, researches have traditionally thought that the annual migration cycle of the Blue Whale is similar to that of other species of rorquals, with whales feeding at high latitudes (either austral or boreal depending on the hemisphere) during summer and fasting at low latitudes during winter, while giving birth and breeding. Several recent studies, however, suggest that Blue Whales likely continue to feed during winter, given the clustering of Blue Whales in areas with locally dense concentrations of krill and other planktonic crustaceans at this time of year. This behavior may be a consequence ofthe extremely large size of Blue Whales and an inability on the part of individuals to maintain sufficient energy stores through a long winterfast. Breeding. Not a great deal is known about breeding behavior of Blue Whales except that such activities are generally synchronized with the annual migration cycle. In this scheme, breeding typically occurs during winter—austral winter in the Southern Hemisphere and boreal winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, reproductive seasons for northern and southern populations are c.6 months out of phase, which suggests an allopatric condition that leaves little opportunity for interbreeding among populations from opposite hemispheres. Blue Whales have a 2year interbirth interval characterized by a 10-12month gestation, a 6—7month lactation period, and a 6-7month anestrous. Shipboard observations of Northern Blue Whales near the Costa Rica Dome in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean have documented neonates and mothers during boreal winter, an indication that births are occurring at least nearby. In the same waters, trios of adult Blue Whales displaying boisterous behavior suggest that courtship and mating are also taking place. Newborn Blue Whales typically are 600-700 cm long and weigh ¢.2000-3000 kg. Nursing young gain ¢.91 kg/day for their first year of life, and young are weaned when they are ¢.1600 cm long and 6-7 months old. Yearlings continue to grow at an average rate of 100-200 cm/year until they reach sexual maturity at c.8-10 years of age. Antarctic Blue Whales reach sexual maturity at ¢.2300 cm in males and ¢.2400 cm in females. Pygmy Blue Whales reach sexual maturity at ¢.1800 cm in males and ¢.1920 cm in females. Physical maturity in Pygmy Blue Whalesis reached at a length of ¢.2050 cm in males and ¢.2180 cm in females; in Antarctic Blue Whales, it is reached at ¢.2410 cm in males and ¢.2620 cm in females. Although some Blue Whales may live up to 80 years, average longevity of Antarctic Blue Whales is probably slightly greater than 65 years. On following pages: 6. Omura’s Whale ( Balaenoptera omurai ); 7. Fin Whale ( Balaenoptera physalus ); 8. Humpback Whale ( Megaptera novaeangliae ). Activity patterns. Daily activity patterns of Blue Whales have been described on summer feeding grounds in both hemispheres and consist of foraging individuals generally following diel movements of their prey (deep water during day and shallow water at night). Perhaps more than other species of rorquals, annual activity patterns of Blue Whales are ratherstrictly related to migration between high-latitude summer feeding grounds and low-latitude winter breeding and birthing grounds. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Worldwide, Blue Whales have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring in all major ocean basins except the Arctic. Precise information on migration routes and home ranges is limited and comes from a variety of data sources including historical whaling records, stranding records, and results of modern sighting and acoustic surveys. Data for some subspecies and populations are more extensive than for others, and general biogeographic patterns have undoubtedly been altered by intense, worldwide exploitation of Blue Whales that occurred from 1904 to 1973. Extremely depleted populations of Antarctic Blue Whales retain a nearly circumpolar distribution in Antarctic waters during austral summer and early autumn feeding season in November—March. During this period, their distribution appears to be strongly linked to latitude, with feeding individuals concentrated along latitudinal bands south of 60° S (generally south of the Antarctic Polar Front). In contrast, distribution of Antarctic Blue Whales during austral winter seems to be more clustered, localized, and compressed along low-latitude continental margins and offshore submerged volcanic platforms in areas associated with upwelling. Historical whaling records suggest that during austral winter, Antarctic Blue Whales formerly were concentrated in the eastern South Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Africa from South Africa to DR Congo, with their distribution likely linked to waters of high primary and secondary production associated with the upwelling system of the north-flowing Benguela Current. A similar distribution of Blue Whales is proposed in the eastern South Pacific Ocean off Chile and Peru. Although clearly most Antarctic Blue Whales migrate into low latitudes during austral winter,it is not certain if they all do. In fact a close examination of whaling records suggests that there may have been a resident population of Antarctic Blue Whales in and around South Georgia Island (54° S) that routinely overwintered in the high-productivity waters surrounding this oceanic island. Migratory patterns of Pygmy Blue Whales are poorly known. It appears, however, based on historical whaling records and sighting and acoustic surveys, that the population of these whales in the south-western Indian Ocean south of Madagascar moves southward during austral winter and then disperses longitudinally across the subantarctic region from Africa to Australia. Evidence indicates that some of these individuals may migrate northward to Diego Garcia (6° S) in the central Indian Ocean during austral winter. Additional evidence, however, suggests occurrence of a year-round resident population of Pygmy Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean, another year-round resident population off southern Madagascar, and a possible third year-round resident population in waters around Australia and New Zealand. In the Northern Hemisphere, different populations of Blue Whales have been recognized in eastern and western parts of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The western North Atlantic population of Blue Whales ranges from Greenland (60-70° N) in boreal summerto South Carolina (34° N) in winter, while the eastern population has its boreal summer range as far north as the Barents Sea and Svalbard (80° N) and winters in the region around the Cape Verde Islands (15° N). The population of Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific Ocean appears to spend boreal winter in waters off Baja California (25° N), south to the Costa Rica Dome (10° N), and in the summer,it ranges north to the Aleutian Islands (55° N), with some resident individuals remaining off the central California coast (34° N). The population of Blue Whales in the western North Pacific Ocean spends boreal summer feeding in waters off Kamchatka and the Kuriles Islands (45-60° N) and migrates south in winter to the area south ofJapan around the Bonin Islands (27° N). Social structure of Blue Whales is largely unknown. Most observations at sea are solitary individuals or pairs. Aggregations of 50 or more individuals have been reported on summer feeding grounds, but these concentrations are most likely because of the high productivity of polar seas.

Songs of Blue Whales can be detected for hundreds and perhaps even thousands of kilometers, and researchers have distinguished nine song types worldwide, each associated with a different geographical region. Four song types are recognized in the Pacific Ocean, at least three in the Indian Ocean, and one each in the Atlantic Ocean and Southern Ocean. These song types, some of which have remained stable for more than 30 years, probably reflect distinct populations and thus serve as another potential means for characterizing population structure. Although functions of Blue Whale songs are currently unknown,it is likely that, at a minimum, they serve as social signals between interacting individuals. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Antarctic Blue Whaleis listed as Critically Endangered and the Pygmy Blue Whale as Data Deficient. Causes of population decline are obvious and well documented in kill records kept by the whaling industry. During the first one-half of the 20"" century, more than 330,000 Antarctic Blue Whales were killed in the Southern Ocean alone. Another 13,000 Pygmy Blue Whales were reported killed in the Southern Hemisphere. Whaling records for the Northern Hemisphere document kills of at least 11,000 Northern Blue Whales in the North Atlantic Ocean and 9500 in the North Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that the pre-exploitation population of the Antarctic Blue Whale was ¢.239,000 individuals and at the peak of what can be termed the exploitation bottleneck, the population had been reduced to as few as 400 individuals.

Northern Blue Whales are still rare in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, where they have been largely extirpated from the site of their initial commercial exploitation. In the North Pacific Ocean, it is estimated that the population (based on 2004 data) is ¢.3000 Northern Blue Whales. Although size of the current global population of Blue Whales is uncertain, a figure of 10,000-25,000 seems reasonable. If correct, this suggests a population decline of 89-97% from the estimated 1911 world population. Today, protected from all types of commercial exploitation, populations of Blue Whale continue to increase, bringing this largest of all mammals back from the brink of extinction. Ongoing threats include entanglement in fishing gear (bycatch), fatal encounters with vessels (ship strikes), anthropogenic impacts (shipping traffic noise), and habitat decline.

Newborns are ¢.10 cm in total length and weigh ¢.85 kg. Walruses have relatively small heads, broadly flattened muzzles with thick short bristly whiskers, and robust torsos. Adult male and female Walruses are recognizable by their long external tusks (modified upper canine teeth). These canine teeth start developing early in life and can grow to 100 cm long and weight 5 kg. Tusks function as weapons, particularly for males during the breeding season; both sexes use them for support when foraging on the seafloor and as picks to anchor themselves to edges ofice floes and assist in pulling themselves out of the water. Post-canine teeth are very small pegs and appear to be largely non-functional. Chest and neck of adult males are massive and covered with wart-like nodules and tubercles. Skin is very thick, up to 6 cm on the chest of males. Both sexes have sparse pelage of brown to cinnamon hair and thick fat layers. Skin color varies from pale gray or even white to pink or reddish brown or gray, depending on whether blood is being restricted from flowing to the skin (light tones) to conserve heat (vasoconstriction) or specifically directed to the skin (dark tones) to dissipate heat (vasodilatation). The Pacific Walrus in the Arctic region of the North Pacific Ocean is more numerous, weighs more, and has longer upper canines and broader snout than the “Atlantic Walrus” (O. » rosmarus).","Open pack ice of Arctic regions of the northern Pacific and Atlantic oceans in winter. In some areas, Walruses remain with the sea ice as it recedes in summer, although they can also be found ashore on islands and mainland coast in the Bering Sea, eastern Canada, and west-central Greenland.","Walruses mainly eat benthic invertebrates that they locate with their sensitive vibrissae on their upper lips on the muddy seafloor. Food items are extracted with powerful suction created by their tongues and mouth. They can supplement this diet with slow moving fish, worms, molting crabs, and shrimps. The most important prey of Atlantic Walruses near Svalbard, Norway, are the blunt gaper clam (Mya truncata) and various medium-sized sea snails in the genus Buccinum. Pacific Walruses in the Bering and Chukchi seas eat a variety of bivalves, gastropods, and polychaete worms. Occasionally, Walruses hunt and eat Northern Fur Seals (Callorhinus ursinus), Bearded Seals (Erignathus barbatus), Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida), and Spotted Seals (Phoca largha). They also scavenge cetacean carcasses by sucking out blubber and inner organs. Foraging dives are to depths of 200-500 m or more and last up to c¢.40 minutes.","Walruses are polygynous, with males competing with each other through visual and acoustic displays and occasionally physical battles in the water to defend access to estrous females resting nearby. Nevertheless, there are scant details on most aspects of breeding behavior of Walruses because their breeding season is in December—-March generally in areas with considerable cover of sea ice that are difficult to access and not often visited by researchers. It has been suggested that their breeding system might resemble a “lek system” whereby males use vocal and visual displays while in the water to attract females in areas where they are more densely distributed relative to suitable sea-ice conditions and food availability. Mating is thought to occur in the water. After impregnation, the egg develops briefly and then is dormant for ¢.5-6 months before the embryo attaches to the uterine wall and resumes development (i.e. delayed implantation). Single neonates are born from mid-April to mid-June, with a peak in May. Offspring nurse for 2-2-5 years. In some populations, birth interval may be as along as three years. Most young are weaned by c.3 years old when juvenile males tend to join male groups. Females can be sexually mature at c.8 years old, and many give birth for the first time when they are ten years old. Males mature a few years later, and although they are capable of mating at ten years of age, few evidently do until they are c.15 years old.","Adult males shed and replace their hair in June-August, and adult females shed over a longer period in summer when they can spend time ashore on islands or mainland coasts, or hauled-out on stable ice. Males emit stereotypic, pulsed sounds underwater during the breeding season, which presumably function to attract females and in courtship. Male Atlantic Walruses near Svalbard moved into areas of very high ice cover (more than 90%) in winter, deep into the ice pack and up to 600 km from ice-free water. They spent relatively little time diving to the seafloor, presumably to feed. Activity budgets from data loggers showed that 44% oftheir time was spent under the water, 39% at the water’s surface, and 17% on land. Data loggers suggested that only 40% of the time that these males spent submerged involved foraging.","In most areas, Walruses appear to move north as sea ice recedes in spring and summer and then south as it forms and thickens. Little is known about social organization of Walruses, although they appear to be mostly solitary or as females with suckling young. Exceptions occur in spring and summerin ice-free areas where mostly males aggregate in large dense numbers ashore on islands and mainland beaches. Walruses are generally gregariousin sea-ice habitats near good feeding areas and at mainland and island haul-out sites in summer. Nevertheless, they are not particularly social, and females with offspring generally occur in only very small groups of several dozen, loosely spaced or alone. Social hierarchies develop among males during the breeding season when they compete for access to estrous females.","CITES Appendix III (Canada population only). Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Walruses have long been hunted by Arctic human cultures for their tusk ivory to make tools, weapons, and crafts; their thick skins to make kayak coverings and clothing; their meat for food; and their oil rich fat for food and cooking. They were hunted commercially for more than 300 years by Norwegians, Russians, and British for skins, ivory, blubber to render to oil, and meat; they might have been exterminated in some areas. Russian commercial harvests in the Bering Sea killed up to 8000 Pacific Walruses each year between 1930 and 1960. Subsistence hunting continues in most areas of the Arctic although commercial hunting was banned by Canada in 1931 and the USA in the early 1940s; Russia continued harvests through the 1980s. Poaching, mostly for ivory, continues in many areas. The estimate of the global population of Walruses in the early 1980s was ¢.280,000 individuals, with 90% living in the Pacific sector of the Arctic and 4000-5000 individuals in the Laptev Sea region. Nevertheless, unregulated harvests for ivory since then have evidently reduced the population, perhaps substantially. Overall population estimates in the late 1990s suggested only ¢.200,000 Walruses throughoutits distribution. There has been very slow recovery of populations of Pacific Walruses and very little apparent recovery of populations of Atlantic Walruses.","Allen (1880) | Berta (2009a, 2009b) | Boessenecker & Churchill (2013) | Born (1984) | Born et al.

Chapskii in 1940 in the Laptev Sea is not recognized here as distinct subspecies. Mitochondrial sequence data presented by C.

O. r. divergens Illiger, 1815 — Laptev Sea off N Russia, Bering and Chukchi seas in N Russia and Alaska; vagrant individuals reported S to New England, USA. Descriptive notes. Total length 250-350 cm, averaging 315 cm (males) and ¢.260 cm (females); weight 800-1800 kg, averaging 1500 kg (males) and c.1000 kg (females). Newborns are ¢.10 cm in total length and weigh ¢.85 kg. Walruses have relatively small heads, broadly flattened muzzles with thick short bristly whiskers, and robust torsos. Adult male and female Walruses are recognizable by their long external tusks (modified upper canine teeth). These canine teeth start developing early in life and can grow to 100 cm long and weight 5 kg. Tusks function as weapons, particularly for males during the breeding season; both sexes use them for support when foraging on the seafloor and as picks to anchor themselves to edges ofice floes and assist in pulling themselves out of the water. Post-canine teeth are very small pegs and appear to be largely non-functional. Chest and neck of adult males are massive and covered with wart-like nodules and tubercles. Skin is very thick, up to 6 cm on the chest of males. Both sexes have sparse pelage of brown to cinnamon hair and thick fat layers. Skin color varies from pale gray or even white to pink or reddish brown or gray, depending on whether blood is being restricted from flowing to the skin (light tones) to conserve heat (vasoconstriction) or specifically directed to the skin (dark tones) to dissipate heat (vasodilatation). The Pacific Walrus in the Arctic region of the North Pacific Ocean is more numerous, weighs more, and has longer upper canines and broader snout than the “Atlantic Walrus” (O. » rosmarus). Habitat. Open pack ice of Arctic regions of the northern Pacific and Atlantic oceans in winter. In some areas, Walruses remain with the sea ice as it recedes in summer, although they can also be found ashore on islands and mainland coast in the Bering Sea, eastern Canada, and west-central Greenland. Food and Feeding. Walruses mainly eat benthic invertebrates that they locate with their sensitive vibrissae on their upper lips on the muddy seafloor. Food items are extracted with powerful suction created by their tongues and mouth. They can supplement this diet with slow moving fish, worms, molting crabs, and shrimps. The most important prey of Atlantic Walruses near Svalbard, Norway, are the blunt gaper clam (Mya truncata) and various medium-sized sea snails in the genus Buccinum. Pacific Walruses in the Bering and Chukchi seas eat a variety of bivalves, gastropods, and polychaete worms. Occasionally, Walruses hunt and eat Northern Fur Seals (Callorhinus ursinus), Bearded Seals (Erignathus barbatus), Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida), and Spotted Seals (Phoca largha). They also scavenge cetacean carcasses by sucking out blubber and inner organs. Foraging dives are to depths of 200-500 m or more and last up to c¢.40 minutes. Breeding. Walruses are polygynous, with males competing with each other through visual and acoustic displays and occasionally physical battles in the water to defend access to estrous females resting nearby. Nevertheless, there are scant details on most aspects of breeding behavior of Walruses because their breeding season is in December—-March generally in areas with considerable cover of sea ice that are difficult to access and not often visited by researchers. It has been suggested that their breeding system might resemble a “lek system” whereby males use vocal and visual displays while in the water to attract females in areas where they are more densely distributed relative to suitable sea-ice conditions and food availability. Mating is thought to occur in the water. After impregnation, the egg develops briefly and then is dormant for ¢.5-6 months before the embryo attaches to the uterine wall and resumes development (i.e. delayed implantation). Single neonates are born from mid-April to mid-June, with a peak in May. Offspring nurse for 2-2-5 years. In some populations, birth interval may be as along as three years. Most young are weaned by c.3 years old when juvenile males tend to join male groups. Females can be sexually mature at c.8 years old, and many give birth for the first time when they are ten years old. Males mature a few years later, and although they are capable of mating at ten years of age, few evidently do until they are c.15 years old. Activity patterns. Adult males shed and replace their hair in June-August, and adult females shed over a longer period in summer when they can spend time ashore on islands or mainland coasts, or hauled-out on stable ice. Males emit stereotypic, pulsed sounds underwater during the breeding season, which presumably function to attract females and in courtship.

Although no subspecies of E. jubatus are recognized in the traditional taxonomy, there is agreement that there are at least two Distinct Population Segments (DPS’s), a Western and an Eastern, with a dividing line between them at 144° W in south-central Alaska. Two subspecies (jubatus for the western population and monteriensis for the eastern) were proposed in several papers that aligned with established DPS’s and are gaining support. Monotypic.","N Pacific from C California N to Alaska and the Aleutian Is chain W to Bering Strait and Kamchatka, and S along the Kuril Is to N Japan, including Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and Sea ofJapan; occasionalvisitor to the Korean Peninsula and China.","Total length up to 330 cm (males) and 250 cm (females); weight 1000 kg, but up to 1120 kg (males) and 273 kg (females). Newborns are 100 cm and 18-22 kg. Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 5/5 (x 2) = 34, with a diastema (gap) between the last upper post-canines. Steller Sea Lions are the largest of all otariids. Males and females are heavily built, and mature males have three times the weight of females and are 20-25% longer. Males have mane of guard hairs from head to shoulders and are very muscular in that area. Forehead of adult males is pronounced by sagittal crest on skull—a feature lacking in adult females and juveniles. Relative to massive heads of both sexes, eyes and ear pinnae appear small. Muzzle is thick and blunt, and pale vibrissae are long and prominent. Foreflippers and hindflippers are wide and long. Foreflippers have some hair on dorsal surfaces, but hair does not extend to rounded tips. Otherwise, flippers, including undersides, are covered with dark leathery skin. First digit is the longest and curves back. Cartilaginous rods in hindflippers lengthen toes, and first and fifth digits are longer than three middle digits. Similar to foreflippers, hindflippers have hair on upper part closest to body but otherwise are covered in dark leathery skin. Adults are tawny yellow to pale tan, with darker brown or reddish coloration on belly. When coat is wet, adult Steller Sea Lions appear quite pale, unlike most otariids that darken in water. Juveniles are darker than adults, ranging from dark buff to pale brown. Newborns are brownish-black until they molt after ¢.6 months. Scars are darker than the pale coat.","Coastal waters to continental shelf and slope and traverse deeper pelagic zones. Steller Sea Lions will haul out on sea ice. They also enter bays and estuaries and will travel far up rivers in pursuit of anadromous fish. Favored terrestrial habitats are sandy and rock-strewn beaches and steep offshore rocks. In its marine habitats, the main predator is the Killer Whale (Orcinus orca), and great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) may be a danger. In Alaska, stomach contents of Pacific sleeper sharks (Somniosus pacificus) have included remains of Steller Sea Lions, which could have been from scavenging rather than direct attacks.","The diet of the Steller Sea Lion is composed of diverse fish and invertebrate species. In Alaska, they consume walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), herring, sand lance ( Ammodytidae ), flatfish, salmon ( Salmonidae ), and rockfish ( Sebastidae ), along with squid, octopus, and mollusks. Lactating females forage mostly at night, but after the breeding season ends, they will feed day or night. Adult males prey on juvenile Northern Fur Seals ( Callorhinus ursinus ), Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina), Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida), and possibly Sea Otters (Enhydra lutris).","The Steller Sea Lion has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the New Zealand Sea Lion ( Phocarctos hookeri ). For Steller Sea Lions, breeding season is in late spring and summer. Females mature at 3-6 years old. Adult males must be nine years old or more before they can establish territories, which they maintain through fighting, displays, and powerful deep roars, moving their heads up and down as they vocalize. Births occur in May-July. Female Steller Sea Lions remain with their newborns for 7-10 days after birth and then leave on foraging trips that are mainly nocturnal and last for 18-25 hours. Females enter estrus c.14 days after they give birth. Many young are weaned prior to the subsequent breeding season, but females may nurse yearlings, older offspring, and newborns at the same time. Gestation is c.12 months, including a delayed implantation of c¢.3 months. Usually, adult female otariids living in areas with good productivity have anywhere from a high 70% to a low 90% reproductive success rate, but annual pregnancy rate has declined and was estimated to be only 55% in the 1980s. Life span of the Steller Sea Lion is up to 30 years for females and c¢.20 years for males.","At sea, Steller Sea Lions are most often seen singly or in small groups of 2-12 individuals. In eastern part of their distribution, they may travel with California Sea Lions ( Zalophus californianus ) and aggregate where prey is abundant. Diving abilities of adult male Steller Sea Lions are unknown, but females reach depths of up to 200 m during dives lasting two minutes or less, and they dive deeper in winter than summer. Yearlings can regularly dive to c.140 m.","Steller Sea Lions are non-migratory, with adults generally feeding and living near their breeding rookeries, although immature individuals will undertake long distance trips. They are relatively sociable and may leave haul-outs simultaneously in large groups. In the eastern part of their distribution, they will often haul out with California Sea Lions and with Northern Fur Seals on the Pribilof Islands. Adult female Steller Sea Lions have a much larger foraging area in winter than summer. Vagrants have been found as far west as China and as far north as Herschel Island in the Beaufort Sea, and south to formerly used habitat in Southern California.","Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Two subspecies are listed on The IUCN Red List as Endangered (jubatus) and Least Concern (monteriensis). In the United States, the Western DPS is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, and the Eastern DPS was recently delisted and considered recovered. Worldwide population of Steller Sea Lionsis estimated at 106,000-118,000 individuals, following a 64% decrease from 1960 to 1989. The decline has been most precipitous in the Western DPS, where numbers in the Aleutian Islands dropped by 81% and in Russia by 74%. This was at a time when the south-eastern Alaska population increased by 70%, causing overall numbers of Steller Sea Lions to increase slightly since 2000. Despite ongoing studies, reasons for decline in the past 50 years remain unclear. Proposed contributing factors are reductions in food resources because of commercial fishing, environmental changes, and increased hunting of Steller Sea Lions by Killer Whales. Steller Sea Lions are known to approach fishing vessels, and this behavior may have led to their being killed as bycatch in net fisheries in Alaskan waters. In the USA,critical habitat has been designated, including no-fishing and no-entry zones near rookeries. Although Steller Sea Lions are protected throughout most of their distribution, Native Alaskans are allowed to harvest 150-300 individials/ year for food and traditional uses.","Atkinson, Calkins et al.

The California Sea Lion is arguably the most familiar of pinnipeds, being the “circus seal” trained to perform at marine aquaria and zoos. It is sexual dimorphic, with adult males 3—4 times heavier and 1-2 times longer than females. Males have enlarged neck, chest, and shoulders, and they develop sagittal crest on skull that creates very pronounced forehead. Because females and juveniles lack sagittal crests, they have flatter heads. Adult females also have more gracile necks. Muzzles of both sexes are long, tapering to blunt rhinaria (nose) that make profiles reminiscent of a dog, particularly in younger individuals. Foreflippers have some hair on dorsal surfaces, but the hair does not extend to rounded tips. Otherwise, flippers, including undersides, are covered with dark leathery skin. First digit is the longest and curves back. Cartilaginous rods in hindflippers lengthen toes, and first and fifth digits are longer than three middle digits. Similar to foreflippers, hindflippers have hair on upper parts closest to body but otherwise are covered in dark leathery skin. Coat color of males begins to darken as they reach sub-adulthood, ultimately turning dark brown in most animals, but wet individuals look black. Some male California Sea Lions are pale-brown. Adult females and juveniles are a warm buff color above, with darker browns on bellies and nearflippers. Face of adult males can have pale areas on muzzle and ear pinnae and around eyes. Prominent sagittal crest in males is accentuated by paler hair on steep forehead. Newborns have blackish-brown natal coat that is soon shed for a pale-brown coat that is molted at 5-6 months of age. As they approach their annual molt, coloration of California Sea Lions, at any age, can look dull and grayish.","Over continental shelf and slope and cross deep pelagic waters to reach islands such as Alijos Rocks and Guadalupe Island, west of Baja California. California Sea Lions are commonly seen in bays, harbors, estuaries, and, to a lesser extent, rivers. Rookeries and haul-outs are typically located on rocks or sandy or rocky beaches. Favored haul-outsites are coastal headlands and cliffs that prevent terrestrial predators from approaching. They will also haul out on manmade structures such as jetties, buoys, docks, and boats at anchor. Marine predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) and sharks, and terrestrial predators include Coyotes ( Canis latrans) and feral dogs. Bald eagles (Haliaetus leucocephalus) were once known to prey on neonates on the Channel Islands of California.","The diet of the California Sea Lion is extremely varied. On the outer Pacific coast prey includes whiting, jack, mackerel, blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), rockfish ( Sebastidae ), herring, northern anchovy ( Engraulidae ), salmon ( Salmonidae ), squid, and octopus. In the Gulf of California, in addition to northern anchovy, whiting, and rockfish, they eat midshipman fish (Porichthys spp.), lanternfish ( Myctophidae ), bass, sardines ( Clupeidae ), cutlassfish and hairtails ( Trichiuridae ), aulopus ( Aulopidae ), and cusk-eels ( Ophidiidae ). California Sea Lions will travel far upriver in pursuit of food and are notorious for aggregating at the base of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon, USA—some 233 km inland—to prey on runs of migrating salmon.","The California Sea Lion has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the New Zealand Sea Lion ( Phocarctos hookeri ). For the California Sea Lion, breeding season is in May—July and lasts 3-5 weeks longer in the Gulf of California than along the southern California coast. Births in May occur c.12 days earlier in the Gulf of California than on the west coast of California. Males maintain territories on beaches and in nearshore water for up to 45 days. Females give birth to a single neonate after an 11month gestation and then remain with the neonate for c.7 days before leaving to feed at sea for 2-3 days. They return for nursing bouts that last 1-2 days. Weaning takes place when young are a year old, but prior to weaning, they accompany their mothers on trips to sea. Females may extend care for a year, or even as much as 2-3 years. Females enter estrus c.27 days after giving birth. An unusual otariid breeding behavior occurs in California Sea Lions, where females form “milling groups” on the beach. They roll in the splash zone and on the sand, mounting each other and even nearby males in an apparent bid for male attention. The milling group breaks up after a male copulates with one of the females. Males and females attain sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age. The California Sea Lion has been known to hybridize with Northern Fur Seals ( Callorhinus ursinus ) and Guadalupe Fur Seals ( Arctocephalus townsend). Life span of the California Sea Lion is c.15-24 years.","At sea, California Sea Lions are frequently observed rafting at the water’s surface, singly or in groups. They often maintain a resting pose by holding a flipper high out of the water. They will also doze offshore, sometimes in the fronds of kelp. They may associate with cetaceans (e.g. following ocean dolphins), possibly as a means of locating suitable prey. They are known to travel alongside large baleen whales, including Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Blue Whales (Balaenoptera musculus), and even ride whales’ bow waves. California Sea Lions are acrobatic and can be seen making high jumps, surfing waves near the beach, and riding stern wakes of ships. They “porpoise,” or leap from the water, when swimming at high speed. From a distance, groups of porpoising sea lions can appear to be a group of ocean dolphins. Generally, California Sea Lions are not deep divers. Average foraging dive of lactating females is less than 80 m and lasts less than three minutes. Maximum depth of a dive in one study was 274 m, with the longest duration of almost ten minutes. Lactating females are active nearly the entire time they spend at sea, foraging day and night, with an increase in diving during twilight hours. Ashore, adult males are among the most vocal pinniped. Territorial males can bark incessantly. Their bark is loud and monotonous, often made with a side-to-side wave of the head. Females and young individuals do not repetitively bark. California Sea Lions are tolerant of other species of pinnipeds and are known to haul out with Steller Sea Lions ( Eumetopias jubatus), Guadalupe Fur Seals, Northern Fur Seals, Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris), and occasionally Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina).","Male California Sea Lions tend to be migratory, traveling north from major rookeries after the breeding season. Large numbers of them will travel up the coast from 13 major colonies in Baja California and southern California, with some making it to British Columbia, south-eastern Alaska, and as far as the Gulf of Alaska. Most rookeries are south of Point Conception, California. The California Sea Lion is spreading north, and females are now regularly seen in northern California where historic breeding locations have been reoccupied. It is resident in the Gulf of California throughout the year, and that population is apparently more sedentary, refraining from long distance travel away from the 13 rookeries located there. Vagrant California Sea Lions have reached the Bering Sea in the north and the Mexican state of Chiapas in the south.","Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population of California Sea Lions is thriving and numbers ¢.355,000 individuals. Numbers are increasing in California, where the population is ¢.238,000 individuals, perhaps approaching maximum carrying capacity. In Mexico, the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula has a population of ¢.75,000-87,000 individuals. The Gulf of California population is ¢.30,000 individuals, a decrease of ¢.20% in the last 15 years, and some rookeries have experienced reductions of 35% in this same time period. California Sea Lions were hunted by indigenous peoples, as evidenced by their skeletal material in middens (collections of domestic waste) in southern California. They were harvested commercially in the 19"" and 20"" centuries, and because they were viewed as pests, government bounties led to dramatic population reductions. Hunting bans in the mid-20"" century culminated with the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. This and similar legal action in Mexico have allowed populations to recover. Mortality persists due to fisheries conflicts and entanglement in marine debris. California Sea Lions are bold predators, willing to steal salmon and rockfish off fishing hooks, making them a nuisance to commercial fisheries. They are also at risk from pollutants in the food chain, especially persistent organochlorines (e.g. DDT and PCBs) and pesticides from urban discharges and agricultural runoff into coastal waters. California Sea Lions are susceptible to lethal poisoning caused by domoic acid, a biotoxin produced by marine diatom blooms. They can also contract diseases from terrestrial animals, including leptospirosis. Natural cycles in the marine environment can have a major impact on the California/Baja California population.

California Sea Lion Zalophus californianus French: Otarie de Californie / German: Kalifornischer Seelowe / Spanish: Le6n marino de California Other common names: California Sealion , Californian Sea Lion Taxonomy. Otaria californiana Lesson, 1828 , “les rochers dans le voisinage de la baie San-Francisco” (= San Francisco Bay), California, United States . Formerly referred to as Z. c. californianus , one of three subspecies of Z. californianus . Three closely related taxa, Z. californianus , Z. wollebaeki , and the extinct Z. japonicus are now full species. Monotypic. Distribution. E North Pacific Ocean from SC Alaska to Islas Marias off Nayarit, Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Descriptive notes. Total length 240 cm (males) and 200 cm (females); weight 390 kg or more (males) and 110 kg (females). Newborns are 80 cm and 6-9 kg. Dental formula varies, 79% =13/2,C1/1,PC5/85 (x2) =534,21%=15%/2,C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. The California Sea Lion is arguably the most familiar of pinnipeds, being the “circus seal” trained to perform at marine aquaria and zoos. It is sexual dimorphic, with adult males 3—4 times heavier and 1-2 times longer than females. Males have enlarged neck, chest, and shoulders, and they develop sagittal crest on skull that creates very pronounced forehead. Because females and juveniles lack sagittal crests, they have flatter heads. Adult females also have more gracile necks. Muzzles of both sexes are long, tapering to blunt rhinaria (nose) that make profiles reminiscent of a dog, particularly in younger individuals. Foreflippers have some hair on dorsal surfaces, but the hair does not extend to rounded tips. Otherwise, flippers, including undersides, are covered with dark leathery skin. First digit is the longest and curves back. Cartilaginous rods in hindflippers lengthen toes, and first and fifth digits are longer than three middle digits. Similar to foreflippers, hindflippers have hair on upper parts closest to body but otherwise are covered in dark leathery skin. Coat color of males begins to darken as they reach sub-adulthood, ultimately turning dark brown in most animals, but wet individuals look black. Some male California Sea Lions are pale-brown. Adult females and juveniles are a warm buff color above, with darker browns on bellies and nearflippers. Face of adult males can have pale areas on muzzle and ear pinnae and around eyes. Prominent sagittal crest in males is accentuated by paler hair on steep forehead. Newborns have blackish-brown natal coat that is soon shed for a pale-brown coat that is molted at 5-6 months of age. As they approach their annual molt, coloration of California Sea Lions, at any age, can look dull and grayish. Habitat. Over continental shelf and slope and cross deep pelagic waters to reach islands such as Alijos Rocks and Guadalupe Island, west of Baja California. California Sea Lions are commonly seen in bays, harbors, estuaries, and, to a lesser extent, rivers. Rookeries and haul-outs are typically located on rocks or sandy or rocky beaches. Favored haul-outsites are coastal headlands and cliffs that prevent terrestrial predators from approaching. They will also haul out on manmade structures such as jetties, buoys, docks, and boats at anchor. Marine predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) and sharks, and terrestrial predators include Coyotes ( Canis latrans) and feral dogs. Bald eagles (Haliaetus leucocephalus) were once known to prey on neonates on the Channel Islands of California. Food and Feeding. The diet of the California Sea Lion is extremely varied. On the outer Pacific coast prey includes whiting, jack, mackerel, blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis), rockfish ( Sebastidae ), herring, northern anchovy ( Engraulidae ), salmon ( Salmonidae ), squid, and octopus. In the Gulf of California, in addition to northern anchovy, whiting, and rockfish, they eat midshipman fish (Porichthys spp.), lanternfish ( Myctophidae ), bass, sardines ( Clupeidae ), cutlassfish and hairtails ( Trichiuridae ), aulopus ( Aulopidae ), and cusk-eels ( Ophidiidae ). California Sea Lions will travel far upriver in pursuit of food and are notorious for aggregating at the base of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon, USA—some 233 km inland—to prey on runs of migrating salmon. Breeding. The California Sea Lion has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the New Zealand Sea Lion ( Phocarctos hookeri ). For the California Sea Lion, breeding season is in May—July and lasts 3-5 weeks longer in the Gulf of California than along the southern California coast. Births in May occur c.12 days earlier in the Gulf of California than on the west coast of California. Males maintain territories on beaches and in nearshore water for up to 45 days. Females give birth to a single neonate after an 11month gestation and then remain with the neonate for c.7 days before leaving to feed at sea for 2-3 days. They return for nursing bouts that last 1-2 days. Weaning takes place when young are a year old, but prior to weaning, they accompany their mothers on trips to sea. Females may extend care for a year, or even as much as 2-3 years. Females enter estrus c.27 days after giving birth. An unusual otariid breeding behavior occurs in California Sea Lions, where females form “milling groups” on the beach. They roll in the splash zone and on the sand, mounting each other and even nearby males in an apparent bid for male attention. The milling group breaks up after a male copulates with one of the females. Males and females attain sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age. The California Sea Lion has been known to hybridize with Northern Fur Seals ( Callorhinus ursinus ) and Guadalupe Fur Seals ( Arctocephalus townsend). Life span of the California Sea Lion is c.15-24 years. Activity patterns. At sea, California Sea Lions are frequently observed rafting at the water’s surface, singly or in groups. They often maintain a resting pose by holding a flipper high out of the water. They will also doze offshore, sometimes in the fronds of kelp. They may associate with cetaceans (e.g. following ocean dolphins), possibly as a means of locating suitable prey. They are known to travel alongside large baleen whales, including Humpback Whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and Blue Whales (Balaenoptera musculus), and even ride whales’ bow waves. California Sea Lions are acrobatic and can be seen making high jumps, surfing waves near the beach, and riding stern wakes of ships. They “porpoise,” or leap from the water, when swimming at high speed. From a distance, groups of porpoising sea lions can appear to be a group of ocean dolphins. Generally, California Sea Lions are not deep divers. Average foraging dive of lactating females is less than 80 m and lasts less than three minutes. Maximum depth of a dive in one study was 274 m, with the longest duration of almost ten minutes. Lactating females are active nearly the entire time they spend at sea, foraging day and night, with an increase in diving during twilight hours. Ashore, adult males are among the most vocal pinniped. Territorial males can bark incessantly. Their bark is loud and monotonous, often made with a side-to-side wave of the head. Females and young individuals do not repetitively bark. California Sea Lions are tolerant of other species of pinnipeds and are known to haul out with Steller Sea Lions ( Eumetopias jubatus), Guadalupe Fur Seals, Northern Fur Seals, Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris), and occasionally Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina). Movements, Home range and Social organization. Male California Sea Lions tend to be migratory, traveling north from major rookeries after the breeding season. Large numbers of them will travel up the coast from 13 major colonies in Baja California and southern California, with some making it to British Columbia, south-eastern Alaska, and as far as the Gulf of Alaska. Most rookeries are south of Point Conception, California. The California Sea Lion is spreading north, and females are now regularly seen in northern California where historic breeding locations have been reoccupied. It is resident in the Gulf of California throughout the year, and that population is apparently more sedentary, refraining from long distance travel away from the 13 rookeries located there. Vagrant California Sea Lions have reached the Bering Sea in the north and the Mexican state of Chiapas in the south. Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population of California Sea Lions is thriving and numbers ¢.355,000 individuals. Numbers are increasing in California, where the population is ¢.238,000 individuals, perhaps approaching maximum carrying capacity. In Mexico, the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula has a population of ¢.75,000-87,000 individuals. The Gulf of California population is ¢.30,000 individuals, a decrease of ¢.20% in the last 15 years, and some rookeries have experienced reductions of 35% in this same time period. California Sea Lions were hunted by indigenous peoples, as evidenced by their skeletal material in middens (collections of domestic waste) in southern California. They were harvested commercially in the 19"" and 20"" centuries, and because they were viewed as pests, government bounties led to dramatic population reductions. Hunting bans in the mid-20"" century culminated with the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. This and similar legal action in Mexico have allowed populations to recover. Mortality persists due to fisheries conflicts and entanglement in marine debris. California Sea Lions are bold predators, willing to steal salmon and rockfish off fishing hooks, making them a nuisance to commercial fisheries. They are also at risk from pollutants in the food chain, especially persistent organochlorines (e.g. DDT and PCBs) and pesticides from urban discharges and agricultural runoff into coastal waters. California Sea Lions are susceptible to lethal poisoning caused by domoic acid, a biotoxin produced by marine diatom blooms. They can also contract diseases from terrestrial animals, including leptospirosis. Natural cycles in the marine environment can have a major impact on the California/Baja California population. During EI Nino events, food resources are scarce and young and weaker individuals often starve to death. It may take 4-5 years before a population recovers after a severe El Nino event. The Gulf of California population is not subject to such extreme fluctuations, although it has been in a moderate decline. Bibliography.

For Galapagos Sea Lions, breeding takes place in May—January. Males maintain territories for 10-60 days on land or in shallow waters, where most of the copulations occur. After a gestation of c.11 months, a female bears a single offspring annually. She nurses her young for 4-7 days and then leaves for a series of foraging trips that last 0-5-3 days during the cool season. During the warm season, trips may last longer. Some females return at night to nurse their offspring and leave again at dawn. When they are only 1-2 weeks old, young enter shallow waters to learn how to swim. They may be weaned at 11-12 months old (weighing 25-40 kg), but most continue to nurse into their second year. Because the Galapagos Sea Lion is non-migratory, breeding season is long, and females often care for their young for more than a year; nursing offspring can be found on rookeries throughout the year.

Similar to foreflippers, hindflippers have hair on upper part closest to body but otherwise are covered in dark leathery skin. Adult female and young New Zealand Sea Lions are tan, cream, or gray on neck and back, with paler hues on chest and abdomen, although some females show little contrast above and below. Face often has pale areas above ears and eyes and along muzzle. Crown is darker. Males darken as they mature. Oneto three-year-old males are similar to females, although some may be pale ruddy brown. Four-year-olds are darker brown above, with paler hues on chest and abdomen, as they begin to develop muscular neck and shoulders and mane. Fiveand six-year-old males are entirely brownish-black, and some individuals of advanced age appear grizzled because they grow white hairs on mane. Newborn New Zealand Sea Lions are dark brown with pale coloration on head and neck. Young males are darker than female young. At two months of age, young molt into coat similar to females. Molts are annual forjuveniles and adults, occurring over a 2month period in December—June. On following pages: 12. South American Sea Lion ( Otaria byronia ); 13.

Adult females have an unusual habit of moving their young away from breeding beaches and then inland,as far as 1-5 km from the shoreline, to brushy or even forested habitat. Marine predators include sharks, Leopard Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx), and Killer Whales (Orcinus orca).","The diet of the New Zealand Sea Lion is varied and composed of bottom-dwelling and open-water species, including opalfish (Hemerocoetes monopterygius), munida (Munida gregaria), hoki (Macruronus novaezelandiae), rat-tail fish ( Macrouridae ), octopus, squid, salps ( Salpidae ), and crustaceans. Males may also prey on New Zealand Fur Seals and penguins and have been known to cannibalize young.","Unlike the Australian Sea Lion ( Neophoca cinerea ), the New Zealand Sea Lion have a polygynous breeding system with general features like those of fur seals ( Arctocephalus spp. ). Males hold territories on shore and fight, vocalize, and make postural displays to maintain them. Mature males arrive first at a breeding rookery to establish a territory, followed by pregnant females. More than one female will select a male’s territory, and each will give birth to a single neonate soon after arriving there. Non-breeding subadult males, referred to as bachelors, congregate outside territories at edges of rookeries. Breeding males remain ashore continuously. A few days after parturition, a female leaves her neonate to go on a foraging trip at sea. Young are alone, or join a group of other unattended neonates. Males take no role in parenting. Territorial males may pose a threat to young, sometimes trampling or attacking them, but their presence can benefit young by keeping bachelors at bay and reducing crowding in the territory. After a female’s milk stores are replenished, she returns to the rookery, attracting her young with a special high-pitched call. This pattern of nursing bouts and foraging trips repeats until the offspring is weaned at 10-12 months of age, although females may extend care for another year or more. Foraging trips tend to be short when offspring are young and become longeras they get older. Older offspring and juveniles may make foraging trips with their mothers. Soon after she gives birth, the female enters estrus and usually copulates with the male in whose territory she resides. Thus, females are likely to be pregnant and lactating throughout most of their life as an adult. After conception, development ofthe fertilized egg is suspended at the blastocyst stage and then resumes a few months after implanting in the uterus. This delayed implantation allows gestation of only 8-9 months to synchronize to an annual breeding cycle. For New Zealand Sea Lions, the breeding season is in November—]January. Males arrive at the rookery in November, and pregnant females arrive in early December;territories may have up to 25 females. Females are sexually mature at 3—4 years old, and average age of breeding females is 10-7 years. Females bear young 2-1 days after arriving and then enter estrus 7-10 days later. After copulating, females begin feeding trips that average 2-7 days, followed by a nursing bout of 1-5 days. Unusual for pinnipeds, some lactating females will allow an offspring of another female to nurse alongside her offspring. Male New Zealand Sea Lions abandon the rookery by mid-January, at which time females move with their young away from the rookery, then inland to vegetated habitat to avoid attention from the remaining males. In addition to being killed by males, young also suffer from bacterial infection, hookworms, and starvation, resulting in an annual mortality rate of ¢.35%. Life span is 23 years or more for males and 26 years or more for females.","At sea, New Zealand Sea Lions dive energetically, are among the deepest-diving sea lions, and frequently feed on benthic prey. Typical dives reach depths of 129 m and last for 3-9 minutes. Maximum dives are more than 600 m and last up to 14-5 minutes.","New Zealand Sea Lions are nonmigratory. They will spread out to sea after the breeding season, but some individuals can be found at major colonies throughout the year. After territorial males begin to depart the rookery, females and young depart to avoid aggressive non-territorial males that attempt to mate with females and can attack young. This often requires the young to swim with its mother from its natal site to another island with suitable habitat. New Zealand Sea Lions will wander outside their primary distribution and have been seen at Macquarie Island.","Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Total population of the New Zealand Sea Lion is ¢.11,900 individuals. It was more abundant historically, with a distribution that included both the North Island and South Island of New Zealand. It has endured hunting pressure beginning with the Maori people, followed by European sealers in the 19"" century. Despite nearly exterminating the population of New Zealand Sea Lions at the Auckland Islands, commercial hunting did not end until the mid-20"" century. New Zealand Sea Lions are restricted to just a few isolated breeding islands, and small numbers breed on the south-eastern coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Birth rates have declined since 1997 for unknown reasons, although contributing factors may be mortality as bycatch in fisheries and disease. The squid fishery near the Auckland Islands resulted in the deaths of 1-2% of adult females annually. Despite stricter management of the operations, including sea lion escape features required in the trawl nets, 17-132 New Zealand Sea Lions were killed each year in 1988-2007. Young also suffered three unusual mortality events in 1998, 2002, and 2003 that were caused by bacterial infections. Infections may have been exacerbated by stresses associated with prey shortages due to El Nino weather patterns. New Zealand Sea lions recolonizing the South Island have experienced conflicts with humans because females with young relocate from shoreline rookeries up to 1-5 km inland, and some males travel 0-5 km from the shoreline. There they encounter a human-altered environment with buildings, sports fields, campgrounds, and gardens. Several New Zealand Sea Lions have been hit by motor vehicles as they crossed roads. These inland movements will need to be considered when drafting protective legislation and designing conservation areas.","Augé, Chilvers, Mathieu & Moore (2012) | Augé, Chilvers, Moore et al.

Australian Sea Lions are sexually dimorphic, with adult males having 2-5-3-5 times the weight and 1-2 times the length of females. In both sexes, head is relatively wide and long, larger in males, with muzzle tapering to a blunt rhinarium (nose). Eyes are set well apart, and short ear pinnae lay close to side of head. Males have moderate forehead, produced by sagittal crest that lies toward back of skull, and they have conspicuously large neck, chest, and shoulders. Foreflippers have some hair on dorsal surfaces, but it does not extend to rounded tips. Otherwise,flippers, including undersides, are covered with dark leathery skin. First digitis the longest and curves back. Cartilaginous rods in hindflippers lengthen toes, and first and fifth digits are longer than three middle digits. Similar to foreflippers, hindflippers have hair on upper part closest to body, but they otherwise are covered in dark leathery skin. Coat color of females and juveniles is yellowish-tan to light gray above, and buff to light yellow below, with diffuse dividing line from side of neck down to base of foreflippers and back along sides. Pattern on face varies, with pale color of chest extending higher to include muzzle, often surrounding eyes, and even reaching ear pinnae. Some female Australian Sea Lions are darker over their entire bodies, showing little color contrast. Males darken as they age, developing dark spots on chest as the first sign. Males grow mane of guard hairs that reaches from head to shoulders. Their body is dark brown, with a buff crown and nape that fades into darker body color on back of neck, but pale crown contrasts sharply with face color, giving them an appearance of wearing dark masks. Males that are not fully mature can show a transition pattern with pale circles surrounding eyes. Newborns are deep brown to gray-black but become grayer with age. They may also show a pale crown, giving the impression of having dark facemasks. First molt begins at 8-10 weeks, after which their coat resembles that of a female.",Over continental shelf and coral reefs of the Houtman Albrolhos Islands. Australian Sea Lions preferred breeding sites on sandy or rock-strewn beaches. Predators include great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and potentially Killer Whales (Orcinus orca).,"There is scant information about the diet of the Australian Sea Lion, but lactating females forage diurnally, mainly for bottom-dwelling species. They consume fish such as whiting, Australian salmon (Arripis sp.), rays, and small sharks, and squid,cuttlefish, and small crabs. They also prey on penguins, seabirds, and even small sea turtles and are known to steal lobsters from traps.","Although Australian Sea Lions have a breeding system that shares somefeatures typical for sea lions, they are unique among otariids in having no synchronized annual breeding cycle. Females give birth every 17-18 months, and timing of births at nearby rookeries may be completely different. Young can be born at any time of year, with females in the same rookery giving birth over 5-7 months. Rather than defending a well-defined, fixed area of land or water,as other species of sea lions do, male Australian Sea Lions maintain a territory around individual females, excluding other males and physically restraining and chasing females to prevent their departure until they have entered estrus. Like all sea lions, the female Australian Sea Lion begins estrus soon after giving birth and usually copulates with the male guarding her. After conception, development of the fertilized egg is suspended at the blastocyst stage and then resumes a few months later by implanting in the uterus. In other species of sea lion, this delayed implantation allows short gestation to synchronize to an annual breeding cycle. In the case of Australian Sea Lions, delayed implantation precedes a 14month developmental gestation, the longest for any pinniped. Female Australian Sea Lions enter estrus 7-10 days after they give birth. After copulating, the male moves on, finding and guarding another female, repeating the pattern until hunger drives him to leave the beach to find food at sea. This breeding system is termed “sequential polygyny.” Males defend their territories vocally (guttural clicks, growls, and barks), with postural displays, and by fighting. Males take no role in parenting and are, in fact, a serious dangerto offspring. Males will attack and toss young, or trample them accidentally when challenging rivals. Females care for their young continuously for the first 9-10 days and then leave them to go on foraging trips at sea. Young are left alone or join a group of other unattended neonates. Young play near the splash zone or in tide pools, and when they are c¢.2 months old, they begin to swim on their own. Over the following five months, lactating females make a series of 2day foraging trips, followed by nursing bouts ashore that average 1-2 days. Weaning occurs at 15-18 months of age, usually about a month before the female is ready to give birth again. Some females may extend care of their young for a year past weaning and can be seen with a newborn and ajuvenile. Lactating females tolerate only their own young and act aggressively toward others. Pregnancy rates of mature females are ¢.71%. Female Australian Sea Lions are sexually mature at 4-5-6 years of age and males at c.6 years. Average age of breeding females is c.11 years, but there is a record of one female giving birth when she was 24 years old. Females live for a maximum of 26 years and males for 21-5 years.","Australian Sea Lions are powerful swimmers and have been observed “porpoising,” leaping in low arcs across the water when traveling at high speed. They often reach their regular feeding destinations by swimming along the sea bottom. Studies of the diving behavior of lactating females revealed they achieve depths of 41-83 m during dives that last 2:2—4-1 minutes. Maximum depth recorded was 105 m, and the longest dive lasted 8-3 minutes.","Australian Sea Lions are non-migratory, remaining near their natal rookeries throughout most oftheir lives. They are Australia’s only endemic pinniped, breeding at more than 70 island sites and several rookeries on the continent. Sixty percent of all births occur at only five rookeries. Maximum distance traveled by a tracked Australian Sea Lion was ¢.250 km. Molecular studies support their tendency toward site fidelity, showing genetic differences even among rookeries located relatively close to each other. Vagrant Australian Sea Lions have seen in eastern Australia as far north as New South Wales.","Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Total population of the Australian Sea Lion is estimated at 13,790 individuals, with 80% in South Australia and 20% in Western Australia. This number is assumed to be much lower than the historical level. Aboriginal Australian people hunted Australian Sea Lions for food and other uses before commercial European sealers arrived in the 18"" and 19"" centuries and extirpated sea lions from Tasmania and the Bass Strait. Despite protections, the extant population has not fully recovered or reoccupied its original distribution, and it is small and genetically fragmented. Due to extreme breeding-site fidelity, most rookeries are essentially subpopulations with their own unique lineages. Fragmentation may be a result of fisheries pressure because bycatch in gill nets remains a significant threat, especially for small subpopulations. As long as bycatch rates remain elevated, declines of Australian Sea Lions are predicted for most rookeries. Fishing gear and marine debris entangle 0-2-1-3% of the population. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999 extends legal protection to all Australian pinnipeds, but widespread measures to safeguard Australian Sea Lions from fisheries conflicts have not been implemented. Population stability was achieved for colonies at Dangerous Reef and Pages Islands in South Australia after fisheries were closed. In contrast, lack of gillnet closures off Kangaroo Island continuesto stress the island’s Seal Bay colony, which isstill declining. Sea lion watching has developed as a tourist industry and is regulated at rookeries and parks to minimize harassment during breeding periods.","Campbell, Chilvers et al.

Males grow mane of guard hairs that reaches from head to shoulders. Their body is dark brown, with a buff crown and nape that fades into darker body color on back of neck, but pale crown contrasts sharply with face color, giving them an appearance of wearing dark masks. Males that are not fully mature can show a transition pattern with pale circles surrounding eyes. Newborns are deep brown to gray-black but become grayer with age. They may also show a pale crown, giving the impression of having dark facemasks. First molt begins at 8-10 weeks, after which their coat resembles that of a female. Habitat. Over continental shelf and coral reefs of the Houtman Albrolhos Islands. Australian Sea Lions preferred breeding sites on sandy or rock-strewn beaches. Predators include great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and potentially Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Food and Feeding. There is scant information about the diet of the Australian Sea Lion, but lactating females forage diurnally, mainly for bottom-dwelling species. They consume fish such as whiting, Australian salmon (Arripis sp.), rays, and small sharks, and squid,cuttlefish, and small crabs. They also prey on penguins, seabirds, and even small sea turtles and are known to steal lobsters from traps. Breeding. Although Australian Sea Lions have a breeding system that shares somefeatures typical for sea lions, they are unique among otariids in having no synchronized annual breeding cycle. Females give birth every 17-18 months, and timing of births at nearby rookeries may be completely different. Young can be born at any time of year, with females in the same rookery giving birth over 5-7 months. Rather than defending a well-defined, fixed area of land or water,as other species of sea lions do, male Australian Sea Lions maintain a territory around individual females, excluding other males and physically restraining and chasing females to prevent their departure until they have entered estrus. Like all sea lions, the female Australian Sea Lion begins estrus soon after giving birth and usually copulates with the male guarding her. After conception, development of the fertilized egg is suspended at the blastocyst stage and then resumes a few months later by implanting in the uterus. In other species of sea lion, this delayed implantation allows short gestation to synchronize to an annual breeding cycle. In the case of Australian Sea Lions, delayed implantation precedes a 14month developmental gestation, the longest for any pinniped. Female Australian Sea Lions enter estrus 7-10 days after they give birth. After copulating, the male moves on, finding and guarding another female, repeating the pattern until hunger drives him to leave the beach to find food at sea. This breeding system is termed “sequential polygyny.” Males defend their territories vocally (guttural clicks, growls, and barks), with postural displays, and by fighting. Males take no role in parenting and are, in fact, a serious dangerto offspring. Males will attack and toss young, or trample them accidentally when challenging rivals. Females care for their young continuously for the first 9-10 days and then leave them to go on foraging trips at sea. Young are left alone or join a group of other unattended neonates. Young play near the splash zone or in tide pools, and when they are c¢.2 months old, they begin to swim on their own. Over the following five months, lactating females make a series of 2day foraging trips, followed by nursing bouts ashore that average 1-2 days. Weaning occurs at 15-18 months of age, usually about a month before the female is ready to give birth again. Some females may extend care of their young for a year past weaning and can be seen with a newborn and ajuvenile. Lactating females tolerate only their own young and act aggressively toward others. Pregnancy rates of mature females are ¢.71%. Female Australian Sea Lions are sexually mature at 4-5-6 years of age and males at c.6 years. Average age of breeding females is c.11 years, but there is a record of one female giving birth when she was 24 years old. Females live for a maximum of 26 years and males for 21-5 years. Activity patterns. Australian Sea Lions are powerful swimmers and have been observed “porpoising,” leaping in low arcs across the water when traveling at high speed. They often reach their regular feeding destinations by swimming along the sea bottom. Studies of the diving behavior of lactating females revealed they achieve depths of 41-83 m during dives that last 2:2—4-1 minutes. Maximum depth recorded was 105 m, and the longest dive lasted 8-3 minutes. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Australian Sea Lions are non-migratory, remaining near their natal rookeries throughout most oftheir lives. They are Australia’s only endemic pinniped, breeding at more than 70 island sites and several rookeries on the continent. Sixty percent of all births occur at only five rookeries. Maximum distance traveled by a tracked Australian Sea Lion was ¢.250 km. Molecular studies support their tendency toward site fidelity, showing genetic differences even among rookeries located relatively close to each other. Vagrant Australian Sea Lions have seen in eastern Australia as far north as New South Wales. Status and Conservation. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Total population of the Australian Sea Lion is estimated at 13,790 individuals, with 80% in South Australia and 20% in Western Australia. This number is assumed to be much lower than the historical level. Aboriginal Australian people hunted Australian Sea Lions for food and other uses before commercial European sealers arrived in the 18"" and 19"" centuries and extirpated sea lions from Tasmania and the Bass Strait. Despite protections, the extant population has not fully recovered or reoccupied its original distribution, and it is small and genetically fragmented. Due to extreme breeding-site fidelity, most rookeries are essentially subpopulations with their own unique lineages. Fragmentation may be a result of fisheries pressure because bycatch in gill nets remains a significant threat, especially for small subpopulations. As long as bycatch rates remain elevated, declines of Australian Sea Lions are predicted for most rookeries. Fishing gear and marine debris entangle 0-2-1-3% of the population. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999 extends legal protection to all Australian pinnipeds, but widespread measures to safeguard Australian Sea Lions from fisheries conflicts have not been implemented. Population stability was achieved for colonies at Dangerous Reef and Pages Islands in South Australia after fisheries were closed. In contrast, lack of gillnet closures off Kangaroo Island continuesto stress the island’s Seal Bay colony, which isstill declining. Sea lion watching has developed as a tourist industry and is regulated at rookeries and parks to minimize harassment during breeding periods. Bibliography. Campbell, Chilvers et al.

The location of origin of Byron’s specimen, given as Tinian, has been doubted by most authors, and it is widely assumed that it was mislabeled and originated in the Falkland Islands (= Malvinas) or from another location where the expedition stopped in southern South America. However, the identity of the specimen as a South American Sea Lion is unquestioned, and thus Byron's specimen has precedence as the first representative ofthis species to be collected and described. O. byronia in the Atlantic Ocean appear to be a genetically isolated population. Monotypic.","South America, from S Brazil to Cape Horn and the Falkland Is in the Atlantic, and N to N Peru in the Pacific.","Total length 260 cm (males) and 200 cm (females); weight up to 300-350 kg (males) and 144 kg (females). Newborns are 75-85 cm and 11-15 kg. Dental formula 13/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. South American Sea Lions are heavy, robust otariids that display a high degree of sexual dimorphism. Muzzle is wide and squared off, and large nose is upturned, conspicuously so in males, whose jaws extend beyond muzzle. Small ear pinnae are not prominent. Males are easily distinguished by enlarged neck and mane reaching from head to chest. Females and subadult males lack manes. Foreflippers have some hair on dorsal surfaces, but hair does not extend to rounded tips. Otherwise, flippers, including undersides, are covered with dark leathery skin. First digit is the longest and curves back. Cartilaginous rods in hindflippers lengthen toes, and first and fifth are longer than three middle digits. Similar to foreflippers, hindflippers have hair on upper part closest to body, but otherwise they are covered in dark leathery skin. Coat of the South American Sea Lion is mainly golden to buff, with varying tints. As they age, males usually darken to a browner color. Mane and abdomen can retain pale hues, and some males never darken, permanently retaining paler female color pattern. Face color on males can make them appear somewhat masked. Newborns are black on upper parts and paler on belly and chest. They molt after 1-2 months to a deep brown, which lightens during their first year.","Mainly coastal, with marine habitat over continental shelf and slope and occasionally in deep pelagic zone. South American Sea Lions may also be found in freshwater habitats such as rivers and near glacier melt water. Predators include sharks, Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), and Leopard Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx, and potentially Pumas (Felis concolor) on land. Killer Whales are well known for their ability to capture juvenile South American Sea Lions on the beach at Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, partially beaching themselves to grab their prey. Vampire bats have been observed lapping blood from flippers of dozing South American Sea Lions.","The extremely varied diet of the South American Sea Lion is composed of several species offish, invertebrates, pinnipeds, and birds. Key prey species include hake, herring, elephantfish ( Callorhinchidae ), anchovy ( Engraulidae ), grenadier ( Macrouridae ), sardines ( Clupeidae ), cusk-eels ( Ophidiidae ), butterfish ( Stromateidae ), lobster krill, squid, octopus, jellyfish, and gastropods. An analysis of stomach contents of individuals killed in fishing nets revealed that males ate primarily mid-water prey and females focused more on bottom-dwelling species. Small numbers of male South American Sea Lion routinely kill and eat South American Fur Seals ( Arctocephalus australis ), especially targeting juveniles. Research has shown that c¢.17% of attacks on fur seals are successful. In the Falkland Islands, South American Sea Lions have been known to kill juvenile Southern Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina). They also eat several species of penguins.","The South American Sea Lion has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the New Zealand Sea Lion ( Phocarctos hookert). For South American Sea Lions, breeding season is in December-March. Males and pregnant females begin to arrive at the rookery in mid-December, and maximum numbers are reached in January. Males at most rookeries will physically dominate females to the point of hauling them off the beach into territories. Non-territorial subadult males may forcibly herd South American Fur Seals as they attempt to copulate with them, often resulting in the death of the fur seals. Territorial behavior has proven to be quite different for rookeries in Peru. Unlike other species of sea lions that hold fixed territories or defend females (as is true for Australian Sea Lions, Neophoca cinerea ), male South American Sea Lions at the Ballestas Islands off Peru lined up along the shoreline where females pass as they come and go during foraging trips, or where they go to cool off from high temperatures in the desert environment. Males also needed to remain near the water to thermoregulate, so they are unable to restrain female movements. Females moved freely, chose their mates, and copulate on the beach—a “lek-like” breeding system. In general, after arriving at rookeries, females give birth within 2-3 days and then enter estrus six days later. They nurse young for 2-3 days before leaving on theirfirst feeding trip at sea, and they return for nursing bouts that usually last two days. Weaning occurs when young are 8-10 months old. Some females extend care to yearlings. A census of young born in Peru revealed that mortality ranges from a level of 13% in a normal weather year to complete failure (100% mortality) during an El Nino event when food is scarce. Gestation is c¢.12 months. Females attain sexual maturity at c.4 years of age, and males are mature at 5-6 years. Life span is ¢.20 years.","South American Sea Lions are seen singly or rafting in groups when at sea. They may aggregate near feeding seabirds and cetaceans. Studies of lactating females reveal that their typical dives are 19-62 m and last 2-7 minutes, with a maximum dive depth of 175 m and duration of 7-7 minutes. A dive depth of 250 m is the expected limit for the South American Sea Lion. Two males tracked at sea made 600 km journeys that lasted 5-6 days before they hauled out. Although diving behavior has not been studied in males, the tagged males spent their time primarily in water 50-100 m deep.","South American Sea Lions are nonmigratory, but some individuals travel considerable distances from colony sites after breeding. Rookeries on the Falkland Islands are deserted during harsh southern winters, but most rookeries retain some residents throughout the year. South American Sea Lions breeding at Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, relocate to Uruguay in the nonbreeding season. Lactating females adjust their movements and nursing patterns depending on food supply. During EI Nino events in Peru, when food resources are scare close to the colonies, they spend more time feeding at sea and less time ashore with offspring. Vagrants reach Bahia, Brazil (13° S) in the Atlantic Ocean and the Galapagos Islands west of mainland Ecuador in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.","Classified as of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List (as O. flavescens ) Total population of the South American Sea Lion is 250,000-280,000 individuals, with ¢.100,000 individuals in mainland Argentina and c.6000 in the Falkland Islands. There are 90,000-100,000 individuals in Chile, ¢.60,000 individuals in Peru, and c.12,000 individuals in Uruguay. Depending on locale, numbers are increasing or decreasing, and many colonies are still recovering from earlier hunting pressure. Native people hunted South American Sea Lions long before commercial sealers arrived from Europe in the 16™ century. Harvesting for hides and oil led to dramatic reductions in numbers. In southern Patagonia, the population of South American Sea Lions is estimated to be only 15% of what it was in the 1940s. In the Falkland Islands, the population may be a mere 20% of earlier levels, falling from ¢.30,000 individuals in the 1960s to ¢.15,000 in the 1980s and ¢.3000 by the 1990s, possibly due to the local trawlnet fisheries. The South American Sea Lion is bycatch in fisheries throughout their distribution, despite legal protections. It has benefited from creation of reserves at rookeries, particularly in Argentina, although enforcement is weak at the more remote sites. Natural cycles in productivity of the marine environment can have profound effects on survival of young, and frequent El Nino events that develop in the Pacific Ocean may put the Peruvian population of South American Sea Lions at risk. It was devastated by the 1997-1998 El Nino, dropping from c.144,000 individuals to ¢.28,000 individuals. The 2003-2004 El Nino reduced the population from ¢.80,000 individuals to ¢.60,000 individuals, during which time production of offspring fell 48%. Currently, this population is showing signs of recovery.","Alonso et al.

Arctocephalus galapagoensis Heller, 1904 , “Wenman Island,” Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Formerly, A. galapagoensis was considered a subspecies of A. australis . Monotypic. Distribution. Galapagos Is, where they occur on almost all the islands. Descriptive notes. Total length 150-160 cm (males) and 110-130 cm (females); weight 60-68 kg (males) and up to 33 kg, average 27-3 kg (females). Neonates are 60-80 cm and 3-4 kg. Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. Galapagos Fur Seals are the smallest species of otariid, and the least sexually dimorphic. Mature males are 1-1-1-3 times the length and 2-2-3 times the weight of mature females. They appear small and relatively compact. Short, straight muzzle tapers to small nose. Vibrissae are pale in adults. Eyes are large, and ear pinnae are long and conspicuous. Although they do not have a mane, adult male Galapagos Fur Seals have thicker shoulders than females. Males do not develop noticeable sagittal crest, but crown of head is slightly round compared with more flattened crown of females. Flippers are short and have dark, sparse, short fur that extends beyond wrists and ankles onto dorsal surface offlippers that are otherwise covered in black leathery skin. Fur is dark brown with gray to ruddy grizzling. In both sexes, muzzle is mostly buff-colored, and adult males can appear to be wearing pale mask. Adult females have pale grayishbuffy chest, and belly is buff to ruddy brown. Young are blackish, occasionally with pale fur around mouth and nose. Habitat. Significant time hauled out on shore and favor rocky coasts with boulders and ledges for shelter from the sun. Because many Galapagos Fur Seals bear scars from shark bites, predators include sharks, as well as Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Feral dogs are the only important terrestrial predators.

Recent work has established that fur seals from Brazil to Argentina, including the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), those in the south-western Pacific Ocean in southern Chile, and another group form central Peru to northern Chile are separate Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs). The strongest differences reported were between previously unrecognized ESUs from Peru to northern Chile and in the western South Atlantic Ocean. Also noteworthy was the almost 20° latitude gap with no A. australis between the two ESUs in the eastern South Pacific Ocean providing a strong barrier isolating the Peruvian and northern Chilean ESUs from the other ESUs. All three ESUs are probably worthy of subspecific distinction. Although several schemes have been suggested, taxonomy and naming of these ESUs remains unresolved. The relationship of A. forsteri to the A. australis ESUsis also controversial with one recommendation that A. forsteri is yet another subspecies of the A. australis complex. More research also needs to be done on the relationship of A. galapagoensis to the A. australis ESUs. Monotypic.","S South America, from Uruguay S to Cape Horn and the Falkland Is on the Atlantic side; on the Pacific side, the Magellanic region and from C Peru to N Chile; regularly visits S Brazil.","Total length up to 190 cm (males) and 150 cm (females); weight 120-160 kg and maybe to as much as 200 kg (males) and 40-50 kg (females). Newborns are 40-65 cm and 3.3-5.5 kg. Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) 36. South American Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic. Adults are stocky, with long prominent ear pinnae, and pale vibrissae of moderate length. Males have thick neck and large shoulders, with mane of longer guard hairs from crown to shoulders, including neck and upper chest. Muzzle is straight, of medium length, and tapers to nose, or rhinarium, which is a bit enlarged, giving an individual a slightly upturned muzzle silhouette. Crown is rounded, and forehead of males is noticeably steep. Flippers have dark, sparse, short fur that extends beyond wrists and ankles onto dorsal surface of flippers that are otherwise covered in black leathery skin. As they mature, male South American Fur Seals become uniformly dark brown but show silvery frosting. Adult females and subadults are brown to gray-black on back and show a mix of paler tans, grays, and ruddy browns on their bellies. Chest and neck are generally lighter in color, in contrast to dark face and head, although area of muzzle containing vibrissae is paler. Ear pinnae are pale, and fur at base may be light colored in adult females and subadults. Young are born with long black fur, but face and muzzle may have pale areas.","Continental shelf and continental slope waters, occasionally as far as 600 km from shore. Terrestrial habitats of South American Fur Seals are on rocky coasts and ledges and shorelines with boulders. These locations usually provide some sheltering from the strong sun. Predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), sharks, South American Sea Lions ( Otaria byronia ), and Leopard Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx). Vampire bats (Desmodontinae) take blood meals from flippers of dozing South American Fur Seals.","Diets of South American Fur Seals change depending on season and foraging area. Lactating females are known to feed nocturnally. Prey includes vertically migrating species and mid-water and bottom-dwelling species. Around islands off Uruguay, fish is the dietary mainstay of the South American Fur Seal. Their prey includes such pelagic and demersal species such as Peruvian anchoveta ( Engraulis ringens), weakfish ( Sciaenidae ), cutlassfish ( Trichiuridae ), and anchovy ( Engraulidae ), and cephalopods and mollusks. Sardines ( Clupeidae ), mackerel, and lobster are eaten off Chile, and squid is commonly consumed around the Falkland Islands.","The South American Fur Seal has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the Northern Fur Seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ). For South American Fur Seals, breeding season is from mid-October through mid-January, and timing may differ among colonies in Peru and those in Chile and the Atlantic Ocean. On Uruguayan islands, males may hold territories for as long as 60 days, and mate with up to 13 females. Sexual maturity for females is reached at c.4 years of age. Seven to ten days after postpartum, the female enters estrus. Time spent by lactating females on foraging trips and nursing offspring differs depending on location and availability of prey. In Uruguay, amount of time that females spend on shore depends on weather. When itis hot, they tend to stay in or near water, but during storm events, they may remain ashore. Young are nursed for 8-24 months before being fully weaned, and females may nurse a yearling and a neonate simultaneously. When food resources are scarce, such as during El Nino events, survival rates for young can be extremely low. Failure to produce offspring has been recorded at some rookeries. High mortality rates of young can also occur in densely packed rookeries and in areas subject to powerful storms. Life span of the South American Fur Seal is unknown; an individual lived 15 years in captivity.","Most of what is known about activities of Southern Fur Seals comes from their time spent ashore during the breeding season. At sea, they may travel or raft together in groups and groom, rest, and feed as described for the Antarctic Fur Seal. Groups frequently gather in the water just offshore of the rookery. When swimming rapidly, they may “porpoise,” or leap clear of the surface. Adult female South America Fur Seals were recorded diving to 29 m, with a maximum of 170 m; average dive time was 2-5 minutes, with a maximum of seven minutes.","Twelve rookeries of South American Fur Seals are located on islands off Argentina, some of which are used for breeding and others for winter haul-outs. Individuals in Patagonia on the Argentine coast are tied to colonies off Uruguay. Because young are rarely born in Patagonia, the recent increased population there is likely the result of migration from Uruguayan islands. A similar exchange may take place in Tierra del Fuego among rookeries on Argentina’s Staten Island and those in Chile by means of the Beagle Channel. Ten breeding sites of South American Fur Seals occur on the Falkland Islands. Little is known about movements of South American Fur Seals at sea. Individuals routinely reach the southern coast of Brazil, and vagrants have been recorded as far north as coastal Colombia and as far west as the Juan Fernandez Islands.","CITES Appendix II.

South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis French: Otarie des Falkland / German: Stidamerika-Seebar / Spanish: Lobo marino de dos pelos Other common names: Falkland Fur Seal , Peruvian Fur Seal , Southern Fur Seal Taxonomy. Phoca australis Zimmermann 1783 , , “Wohnt um Juan Fernandez, und uberhaupt in dortigen Meeren” (= lives to Juan Fernandez, and even in local areas . ) Taxonomy of A. australis is uncertain at the subspecific level. Recent work has established that fur seals from Brazil to Argentina, including the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), those in the south-western Pacific Ocean in southern Chile, and another group form central Peru to northern Chile are separate Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs). The strongest differences reported were between previously unrecognized ESUs from Peru to northern Chile and in the western South Atlantic Ocean. Also noteworthy was the almost 20° latitude gap with no A. australis between the two ESUs in the eastern South Pacific Ocean providing a strong barrier isolating the Peruvian and northern Chilean ESUs from the other ESUs. All three ESUs are probably worthy of subspecific distinction. Although several schemes have been suggested, taxonomy and naming of these ESUs remains unresolved. The relationship of A. forsteri to the A. australis ESUsis also controversial with one recommendation that A. forsteri is yet another subspecies of the A. australis complex. More research also needs to be done on the relationship of A. galapagoensis to the A. australis ESUs. Monotypic. , , Distribution. S South America, from Uruguay S to Cape Horn and the Falkland Is on the Atlantic side; on the Pacific side, the Magellanic region and from C Peru to N Chile; regularly visits S Brazil. Descriptive notes. Total length up to 190 cm (males) and 150 cm (females); weight 120-160 kg and maybe to as much as 200 kg (males) and 40-50 kg (females). Newborns are 40-65 cm and 3.3-5.5 kg. Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) 36. South American Fur Seals are sexually dimorphic. Adults are stocky, with long prominent ear pinnae, and pale vibrissae of moderate length. Males have thick neck and large shoulders, with mane of longer guard hairs from crown to shoulders, including neck and upper chest. Muzzle is straight, of medium length, and tapers to nose, or rhinarium, which is a bit enlarged, giving an individual a slightly upturned muzzle silhouette. Crown is rounded, and forehead of males is noticeably steep. Flippers have dark, sparse, short fur that extends beyond wrists and ankles onto dorsal surface of flippers that are otherwise covered in black leathery skin. As they mature, male South American Fur Seals become uniformly dark brown but show silvery frosting. Adult females and subadults are brown to gray-black on back and show a mix of paler tans, grays, and ruddy browns on their bellies. Chest and neck are generally lighter in color, in contrast to dark face and head, although area of muzzle containing vibrissae is paler. Ear pinnae are pale, and fur at base may be light colored in adult females and subadults. Young are born with long black fur, but face and muzzle may have pale areas. Habitat. Continental shelf and continental slope waters, occasionally as far as 600 km from shore. Terrestrial habitats of South American Fur Seals are on rocky coasts and ledges and shorelines with boulders. These locations usually provide some sheltering from the strong sun. Predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), sharks, South American Sea Lions ( Otaria byronia ), and Leopard Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx). Vampire bats (Desmodontinae) take blood meals from flippers of dozing South American Fur Seals. Food and Feeding. Diets of South American Fur Seals change depending on season and foraging area. Lactating females are known to feed nocturnally. Prey includes vertically migrating species and mid-water and bottom-dwelling species. Around islands off Uruguay, fish is the dietary mainstay of the South American Fur Seal. Their prey includes such pelagic and demersal species such as Peruvian anchoveta ( Engraulis ringens), weakfish ( Sciaenidae ), cutlassfish ( Trichiuridae ), and anchovy ( Engraulidae ), and cephalopods and mollusks. Sardines ( Clupeidae ), mackerel, and lobster are eaten off Chile, and squid is commonly consumed around the Falkland Islands. Breeding. The South American Fur Seal has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the Northern Fur Seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ). For South American Fur Seals, breeding season is from mid-October through mid-January, and timing may differ among colonies in Peru and those in Chile and the Atlantic Ocean. On Uruguayan islands, males may hold territories for as long as 60 days, and mate with up to 13 females. Sexual maturity for females is reached at c.4 years of age. Seven to ten days after postpartum, the female enters estrus. Time spent by lactating females on foraging trips and nursing offspring differs depending on location and availability of prey. In Uruguay, amount of time that females spend on shore depends on weather. When itis hot, they tend to stay in or near water, but during storm events, they may remain ashore. Young are nursed for 8-24 months before being fully weaned, and females may nurse a yearling and a neonate simultaneously. When food resources are scarce, such as during El Nino events, survival rates for young can be extremely low. Failure to produce offspring has been recorded at some rookeries. High mortality rates of young can also occur in densely packed rookeries and in areas subject to powerful storms. Life span of the South American Fur Seal is unknown; an individual lived 15 years in captivity. Activity patterns.

At sea, they may travel or raft together in groups and groom, rest, and feed as described for the Antarctic Fur Seal. Groups frequently gather in the water just offshore of the rookery. When swimming rapidly, they may “porpoise,” or leap clear of the surface. Adult female South America Fur Seals were recorded diving to 29 m, with a maximum of 170 m; average dive time was 2-5 minutes, with a maximum of seven minutes. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Twelve rookeries of South American Fur Seals are located on islands off Argentina, some of which are used for breeding and others for winter haul-outs. Individuals in Patagonia on the Argentine coast are tied to colonies off Uruguay. Because young are rarely born in Patagonia, the recent increased population there is likely the result of migration from Uruguayan islands.

The two subspecies, pusillus (Africa) and doriferus (Australia) are genetically similar, indicating the population split relatively recently into the two groups found today. The Australian subspecies was formerly considered to be two species, A. doriferus and A. tasmanicus. Two subspecies recognized.","A.p.pusillusSchreber,1775—coastalSAfrica,fromAngolatoAlgoaBayinSouthAfrica. A. p. doriferus Wood Jones, 1925 — coastal SE Australia, including Kangaroo I, through Victoria and New South Wales, as well as Tasmania and the Bass Strait.","Total length 200-230 cm (males) and 120-160 cm (females); weight average 274 kg, but up to 353 kg (males) and 57 kg, up to 107 kg (females); newborns 60-70 cm and 6 kg for the “South African Fur Seal” (A. p. pusillus ). Total length 200-230 cm (males) and 136-171 cm (females); weight average 279 kg, but up to 360 kg (males) and 78 kg, up to 110 kg (females); newborns 60-80 cm and 5-12 kg for “Australian Fur Seal” (A. p. doriferus). Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. The two subspecies are similar in morphology and behavior, although Australian Fur Seals are on average slightly heavier than South African Fur Seals. The Afro-Australian Fur Seal is the largest and said to be the most sea lion-like of the fur seals. They are sexually dimorphic, with adult males reaching 3-5 to nearly 4-5 times the weight of females and 1-3-1-9 times their length. They have some resemblance to sea lions. Large head is broad, and crown is more round in males and more flattened in females. Male’s forehead noticeably slopes. Muzzle is long and wide, ending in large nose that overhangs jaws. Long ear pinnae are conspicuous and can be naked in old individuals. Pale vibrissae are of medium length, often reaching to ears. Males have well-developed shoulders, with mane of long guard hairs from nape to chest. Flippers have dark, sparse, short fur that extends beyond wrists and ankles onto dorsal surface of flippers that are otherwise covered in black leathery skin. South African Fur Seals are usually darker in color than Australian Fur Seals. Furis gray-brown with buff to ginger highlights above, and pale ruddy brown on abdomen. Males become darker as they mature and are generally darker than females. Guard hairs appear grizzled on males. Females and subadults can have paler fur on chests than males. Muzzle often looks pale where vibrissae originate, as do bases of ear pinnae. Neonates have mostly black coats, with silver tints, and may be pale below. At 4-5 months of age, young molt to a gray-brown coat and molt again a year later to a silver-gray coat.","Coastal waters and deeper waters of continental shelves and slopes. South African Fur Seals breed on the mainland and islands, and Australian Fur Seals breed on islands in the Bass Strait. Australian Fur Seals favor rocky habitat when ashore. Predators include great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Jackals ( Canidae ) and hyenas ( Hyaenidae ) are predators at mainland rookeries of South African Fur Seals.","Diets of Afro-Australian Fur Seals are varied. Australian Fur Seals prey on species near the sea bottom, such as octopus, squid, barracouta (7hyrsites atun), redbait (Emmelicthys nitidus), greenback horse mackerel (Trachurus declivis), arrow squid (Nototodarus gouldi), and red codling (Pseudophycis bachus). South African Fur Seals consume mid-water and near-surface species, mainly fish such as Cape hake (Merluccius capensis), mackerel, pelagic goby (Sufflogobius bibarbatus), sardines, and anchovy ( Engraulidae ), with some cephalopods (squid) and crustaceans (rock lobster, shrimps, prawns, and amphipods). South African Fur Seals have been known to eat jackass penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and seabirds.","The Afro-Australian Fur Seal has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the Northern Fur Seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ). Female South African Fur Seals and female Australian Fur Seals attain sexual maturity at 3-6 years of age and males at 9-12 years. Breeding season runs from late October to early January. Size of the territories held by males is 62 m* on average and contains about nine females. Annual pregnancy rates are more than 70%, and gestation lasts 51 weeks, including a three-month pause due to delayed implantation. Females bear young within 1-5-2 days after arriving at the rookery. Births peak in early December. Eight or nine days after giving birth, females enter estrus. Length of female foraging trips increases later in the season, from an average of 3-7-6-8 days. Foraging trips of South African Fur Seals tend to be shorter than those of Australian Fur Seals,likely due to better access to food resources in a more productive marine environment. Length of nursing bouts remains steady at an average of 1-7 days. Young are weaned at 10-12 months old, although some are nursed until they are 2-3 years old. Life span for South African Fur Seals is estimated to reach 25 years for a small percentage of individuals. A captive female lived 19 years. Life span for Australian Fur Seals is unknown.","At sea, both subspecies may be found singly or in small groups, congregating in large rafts just offshore of colonies, and they groom, rest, and feed as described for the Antarctic Fur Seal. They are capable of “porpoising,” leaping in low arcs in the air, when swimming at high speed. Lactating Australian Fur Seals reach depths of 65-85 m during dives lasting 2-3-7 minutes; maximum dives reach 164 m and last up to 8-9 minutes. A significant amount of time is spent foraging during the day, rather than feeding nocturnally. Lactating female South African Fur Seals dive to depths of 41-49 m; maximum dives are 191-204 m.","Both subspecies are non-migratory, generally staying in waters of their continental shelves. Nevertheless, South African Fur Seals have been sighted up to 220 km offshore, and Australian Fur Seals may travel as much as 160 km offshore. About 75% of South African Fur Seals breed at three rookeries: Atlas Bay-Wolf Bay-Long Islands, Kleinzee, and Cape Cross. More than 50% of Australian Fur Seals breed at two rookeries: Lady Julia Percy Island and Seal Rocks. Vagrants have reached as far north as the Equator on the Atlantic coast of Gabon and south to the subantarctic Prince Edward Islands.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Neither subspecies has been assessed independently on The IUCN Red List. Population size of the South African Fur Seal is ¢.20 times that of the Australian Fur Seal. Two million South African Fur Seals breed at 23 rookeries; 92,000 Australian Fur Seals breed at nine rookeries. These populations are stable or increasing, after declines due to commercial hunting from the 17"" to 19"" centuries, although neither subspecies was brought to the brink of extinction. The South African Fur Seal appear to have made a stronger recovery than the Australian Fur Seal. Humans have been hunting South African Fur Seals for at least 130,000 years, based on archeological evidence, and annual harvesting of ¢.85,000 young continues today in Namibia. Commercial harvesting ended in South Africa in 1990, but the South African Fur Sealis at risk from lethal fishing-gear entanglements. Rate of entanglement is estimated to be as high as 0-6%. The South African Fur Seal also has colonies close to oil-tanker traffic, making it vulnerable to potential spills. South African Fur Seals hauling-out on the mainland have contact with terrestrial carnivores, exposing them to contagious diseases. Currently, there are no commercial harvests of Australian Fur Seals, but they do come into conflict with fisheries, putting them at risk of gear entanglement and illegal shooting.","Arnould (2009) | Arnould & Hindell (2001) | Arnould et al.

South African Fur Seals consume mid-water and near-surface species, mainly fish such as Cape hake (Merluccius capensis), mackerel, pelagic goby (Sufflogobius bibarbatus), sardines, and anchovy ( Engraulidae ), with some cephalopods (squid) and crustaceans (rock lobster, shrimps, prawns, and amphipods). South African Fur Seals have been known to eat jackass penguins (Spheniscus demersus) and seabirds. Breeding. The Afro-Australian Fur Seal has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the Northern Fur Seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ). Female South African Fur Seals and female Australian Fur Seals attain sexual maturity at 3-6 years of age and males at 9-12 years. Breeding season runs from late October to early January. Size of the territories held by males is 62 m* on average and contains about nine females. Annual pregnancy rates are more than 70%, and gestation lasts 51 weeks, including a three-month pause due to delayed implantation. Females bear young within 1-5-2 days after arriving at the rookery. Births peak in early December. Eight or nine days after giving birth, females enter estrus. Length of female foraging trips increases later in the season, from an average of 3-7-6-8 days. Foraging trips of South African Fur Seals tend to be shorter than those of Australian Fur Seals,likely due to better access to food resources in a more productive marine environment. Length of nursing bouts remains steady at an average of 1-7 days. Young are weaned at 10-12 months old, although some are nursed until they are 2-3 years old. Life span for South African Fur Seals is estimated to reach 25 years for a small percentage of individuals. A captive female lived 19 years. Life span for Australian Fur Seals is unknown. Activity patterns. At sea, both subspecies may be found singly or in small groups, congregating in large rafts just offshore of colonies, and they groom, rest, and feed as described for the Antarctic Fur Seal. They are capable of “porpoising,” leaping in low arcs in the air, when swimming at high speed. Lactating Australian Fur Seals reach depths of 65-85 m during dives lasting 2-3-7 minutes; maximum dives reach 164 m and last up to 8-9 minutes. A significant amount of time is spent foraging during the day, rather than feeding nocturnally. Lactating female South African Fur Seals dive to depths of 41-49 m; maximum dives are 191-204 m. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Both subspecies are non-migratory, generally staying in waters of their continental shelves. Nevertheless, South African Fur Seals have been sighted up to 220 km offshore, and Australian Fur Seals may travel as much as 160 km offshore. About 75% of South African Fur Seals breed at three rookeries: Atlas Bay-Wolf Bay-Long Islands, Kleinzee, and Cape Cross. More than 50% of Australian Fur Seals breed at two rookeries: Lady Julia Percy Island and Seal Rocks. Vagrants have reached as far north as the Equator on the Atlantic coast of Gabon and south to the subantarctic Prince Edward Islands. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Neither subspecies has been assessed independently on The IUCN Red List. Population size of the South African Fur Seal is ¢.20 times that of the Australian Fur Seal. Two million South African Fur Seals breed at 23 rookeries; 92,000 Australian Fur Seals breed at nine rookeries. These populations are stable or increasing, after declines due to commercial hunting from the 17"" to 19"" centuries, although neither subspecies was brought to the brink of extinction. The South African Fur Seal appear to have made a stronger recovery than the Australian Fur Seal. Humans have been hunting South African Fur Seals for at least 130,000 years, based on archeological evidence, and annual harvesting of ¢.85,000 young continues today in Namibia. Commercial harvesting ended in South Africa in 1990, but the South African Fur Sealis at risk from lethal fishing-gear entanglements. Rate of entanglement is estimated to be as high as 0-6%. The South African Fur Seal also has colonies close to oil-tanker traffic, making it vulnerable to potential spills. South African Fur Seals hauling-out on the mainland have contact with terrestrial carnivores, exposing them to contagious diseases. Currently, there are no commercial harvests of Australian Fur Seals, but they do come into conflict with fisheries, putting them at risk of gear entanglement and illegal shooting. Bibliography.

Dental formula 13/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. Antarctic Fur Seals are strongly sexual dimorphic. Mature males weigh 4-5 times as much as females and are 1-4-1-5 times longer. Muzzle is of moderate size and length, tapering to slightly pointed nose that reaches just past mouth. Pale ear pinnae are long and conspicuous. Vibrissae are pale and quite noticeable; adult male Antarctic Fur Seals have some of the longest whiskers of any pinniped, up to 50 cm. Subadults have darker vibrissae that become paler as they grow to adulthood. Adult males have mane of long guard hairs reaching from head to chest, and broad and muscular shoulders and neck. Adult females and subadults are hard to distinguish from males until they are 4-6 years old. Flippers have dark, sparse, short fur that extends beyond wrists and ankles onto dorsal surface of flippers that are otherwise covered in black leathery skin. Fore and hindflippers are long, and first digit is longer than the rest and curves back. Adult males are dark gray to charcoal, with creamy orsilver grizzling on mane and sides. Underfur is buff-colored. Fur of adult females and subadults ranges from gray to brown and may be paler on chest, abdomen, and sides than adult males, with tints of buff or ruddy brown. Pale color can also continue from chest to neck and onto face, including base of ear pinnae and muzzle where vibrissae originate. Newborns are black, with some pale areas on head and, at times, on abdomen. Juveniles molt into the adult female pattern but have silver tints where furis pale. At South Georgia, very pale, or leucistic, Antarctic Fur Seals occur at the rate of one or two per thousand.

On land, Antarctic Fur Seals prefer rocky areas, but they will come ashore on sandy beaches and even move higher up into tussock grass. Predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) and Leopard Seals (Hydrurga leptonyx), which prey on offspring in the South Shetland Islands. At Macquarie Island, young Antarctic Fur Seals are preyed on by New Zealand Sea Lions ( Phocarctos hookeri ).","The diet of the Antarctic Fur Seal varies depending on the area and time of year. At their main colony at South Georgia, breeding females feed nocturnally on krill in summer. At other islands where krill is not available, they eat mainly squid, lanternfish ( Myctophidae ), and cod icefish ( Nototheniidae ). During winter, males at South Georgia eat krill or fish, with squid and lanternfish accounting for only a fraction of their diet. Antarctic Fur Seals will prey on penguins, including king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) on Marion Island and macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and Gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua) off Heard, Macquarie, and South Georgia islands.","The Antarctic Fur Seal has the same general polygynous breeding system as described for the Northern Fur Seal ( Callorhinus ursinus ). Delayed implantation allows gestation of only 8-9 months to synchronize to an annual breeding cycle. Life span is up to 15 years for males and 23 years for females. Breeding of Antarctic Fur Seals occurs from late November to late December. Males arrive at rookeries in late October, establishing territories as small as 20 m* with up to 19 females. At the largest rookery island, South Georgia, males hold territories for an average of 34 days. Females arrive in mid-November and bear young 1-2 days later. They nurse their young for 6-7 days and then enter estrus. Within hours of copulating, they leave on their first feeding trip, which usually lasts 4-5 days before they return to nurse their young for 2-3 days. Offspring are weaned at c.4 months old. Antarctic Fur Seals achieve sexual maturity threat c.3 years in females and c.7 years in males. They hybridize with Subantarctic Fur Seals (A. tropicalis ) at Prince Edward Islands and Crozet Islands and with New Zealand Fur Seals (A. forsteri ) and Subantarctic Fur Seals at Macquarie Island.","At sea, Antarctic Fur Seals groom, rest, and feed as described for the Northern Fur Seal plus an inverted posture with hindflippers up in the air. When traveling rapidly, Antarctic Fur Seals can “porpoise” clear of the water’s surface in low leaping arcs. They typically make numerous shallow foraging dives, mostly during the night.

Movements in winter are not well known. After weaning offspring, females leave the colony areas until the following breeding season. Males mostly disperse, but some subadult and adult males remain at South Georgia throughout the year.

The Antarctic Treaty provides protection for all species of fur seals below 60° S latitude. The remote seas used by Antarctic Fur Seals are not heavily fished, but commercial operations, including krill harvesting, could develop in the future. Injuries from marine debris and discarded fishing gear are current risks, and the fraction of the population that becomes entangled, mostly young individuals,is estimated to be 0-1%. The population bottleneck of the 19"" century reduced genetic diversity of the Antarctic Fur Seal, possibly making it more vulnerable to disease or stresses of climate change.

Newborns are 60-65 cm and 5.4-6 kg. Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. Northern Fur Seals are extremely sexually dimorphic. Mature males are 30-40% longer and 4-5-5 times heavier than mature females. Flipper characteristics are unique. Top of foreflipper has bare skin, demarcated by sharp line where furstarts on wrist. Hindflippers are relatively longer than on any other otariids’ due to long thin extensions of cartilage on each toe. In both sexes, muzzle is short and curved downward, and nose is small. Ear pinnae are long and prominent and may become bare as an individual reaches an advanced age. Vibrissae are long, often extending past ears. Mature adult Northern Fur Seals have pale vibrissae, subadults have vibrissae that are a mix of pale and black, and young have black vibrissae. Adult males are stocky and have mane of long guard hairs from head to neck, chest, and upper back. Their foreheads appearto rise steeply because crown is enlarged by skull’s sagittal crest. Adult females and subadults are moderately built, and it is hard to determine gender until males reach 4-5 years of age and exceed size of females. Furis very thick, with pale-colored underfur. Males are gray to black, or fur may be dark ruddy brown, and mane may show silvery or blonde tints. Adult females and subadults have more variation in fur color but are often dark gray to black above with buff on chest, sides, and neck (where fur may form a pale, contrasting V-shape). Muzzle may be buffy or ruddy colored. Young are born with blackish coat, with some creamy areas on sides and face, and they molt to subadult color by 3-4 months old.","Highly pelagic, often far from shore or at edge of continental shelf or over continental slope. Terrestrial habitat usually consists of rocks and boulders, but it may also be a beach. Predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), sharks, and Steller Sea Lions ( Eumetopias jubatus).","Dietary shifts of Northern Fur Seals occur depending on season and foraging area; diets often includes vertically migrating species. Off California and Washington, Northern Fur Seals eat anchovy ( Engraulidae ), hake, saury ( Scomberesocidae ), squid, rockfish ( Sebastidae ), and salmon ( Salmonidae ). Off Alaska, they eat walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus), sand lance ( Ammodytidae ), herring ( Clupeidae ), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and squid.","All fur seals, including Northern Fur Seals, have a polygynous breeding system with the same general features. Males hold territories onshore and fight, vocalize, or make postural displays to maintain them. Mature males arrive first at a breeding rookery to establish a territory, followed by pregnant females. Almost always, more than one female will select a male’s territory and give birth to a single neonate soon after arriving. Non-breeding subadult males, referred to as bachelors, congregate outside territories at the edge of the rookery. Breeding males remain ashore continuously. A few days after parturition, a female leaves her neonate to go to sea on a foraging trip. Young are left alone or in a group of other unattended young, and males have no role in parenting. Territorial males may pose a threat to young, sometimes trampling or attacking them, but their presence can benefit young by keeping bachelors at bay and reducing crowding in the territory. After a female’s milk stores are replenished, she returns to the territory, attracting her offspring with a special high-pitched call. This pattern of nursing bouts and foraging trips repeatsitself until the offspring is weaned. Foraging trips tend to be short when offspring are young and become longer as they get older. Soon after a female gives birth, she enters estrus and usually copulates with the male in whose territory she resides. Thus, females are likely to be pregnant and lactating throughout most of their entire adult lives. After conception, development of the fertilized egg is suspended at the blastocyst stage and then resumes a few months later after the blastocyst becomes implanted in the uterus. Breeding of Northern Fur Seals on Pribilof Islands occurs from mid-June through August and c.2 weeks earlier on San Miguel Island. Northern Fur Seals reach sexual maturity at 3-5 years old, but males are not large enough to compete for a territory until they are 8-9 years old. Gestation lasts 51 weeks, including the delayed implantation phase of 3-5-4 months. Pregnant females usually give birth a day after arriving at the breeding territory and enter estrus an average of 5-3 days later. They remain with their neonates for an average of 8:3 days before leaving on the first foraging trip. Subsequent nursing bouts ashore usually last less than two days. The female will provide 8-12 nursing bouts, each lasting c.2 days, before the offspring is weaned at c.4 months. Life span is ¢.25 years.","Northern Fur Seals are among the most pelagic of all pinnipeds (seals), with adults remaining at sea for most of the year, except for the breeding season, which lasts 4-5 months for females, including rearing of offspring, and c.45 days for males. They generally avoid hauling-out between breeding seasons, and weaned offspring go to sea and do not touch land until they return to their natal rookery 2-3 years later. At sea, Northern Fur Seals are most likely to be sighted alone or in pairs. When not foraging or traveling at sea, they groom or rest on the water’s surface during the day and usually feed at night or twilight. Typical resting postures at the water’s surface include lying on back or side with one or more flippers extended in the air or held pressed together. They commonly elevate hindflippers, rotate them forward, and drape one or both foreflippers over the top, and hold them above the surface—a posture known as the “jug-handle.” Fur seals groom their pelage by rubbing foreflippers over their bodies and scratching with their three exposed claws on hindflippers. Dives of lactating female Northern Fur Seals lasted 2-2 minutes to an average depth of 68 m; maximum dive lasted 7-6 minutes to a depth of 207 m.","Most Northern Fur Seals breed on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea. Significant numbers also breed on Commander and Kuril islands, Russia; small rookeries occur, on Bogoslof Island in the Bering Sea; Robben Island, Russia; and San Miguel and south-east Farallon Islands off California. Annual migrations of Northern Fur Seals are the longest of any species of otariid, with many individuals traveling from the Bering Sea to winter-feeding areas off California or Japan. Even during the breeding season, lactating females at the Pribilof Islands make longer foraging trips than most other female otariids, lasting 6-9 days on average, to reach the edge of continental shelf. Vagrants have been recorded as far west as the Yellow Sea, near China, south to Taiwan, and north to the Arctic’s Beaufort Sea.","Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Total population of Northern Fur Seals is 900,000-1-1 million individuals and declining. Breeding population on the Pribilof Islands is ¢.650,000 individuals. Luxurious pelt of Northern Fur Seal was the target of intensive hunting soon after breeding rookeries were discovered in the 18"" century. By 1984, when controlled commercial hunting ended, the population had suffered several cycles of declines and recoveries. In the 1950s, it was estimated to be 2-5 million individuals, and that number may be considerably lower than during the pre-exploitation era. Currently, international treaties and agreements are in place to manage the population. Small numbers of Northern Fur Seals on the Pribilof Islands are still killed in a subsistence harvest by Alaskan Natives; 478 subadults were taken in 2007. Fishing-gear entanglement is known to be a lethal threat to Northern Fur Seals. A high level of mortality occurred during the 1980s when the driftnet fishery in the North Pacific Ocean was at its height. Continuing entanglement, commercial catches of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma)—one of the seal’s main prey species—and possible increased predation by Killer Whales may be contributing to the current population decline of Northern Fur Seals.","Call & Ream (2012) | Dickerson et al.

Northern Fur Seal Callorhinus ursinus French: Otarie a fourrure / German: Nordlicher Seebar / Spanish: Lobo marino septentrional Other common names: Alaskan Fur Seal , Pribilof Fur Seal Taxonomy. Phoca ursina Linnaeus, 1758 , “Habitat in Camschatcae maritimis inter Asiam & Americam proximam, primario in insula Beringii.” Restricted by O. Thomas in 1911 to “Bering Island.” This species is monotypic. Distribution. N Pacific, including the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and Sea of Japan, S to Japan (Honshu), and N Mexico (Baja California). Descriptive notes. Total length up to 210 cm (males) and 150 cm (females); weight 180-270 kg (males) and 40-60 kg (females). Newborns are 60-65 cm and 5.4-6 kg. Dental formula I 3/2, C 1/1, PC 6/5 (x 2) = 36. Northern Fur Seals are extremely sexually dimorphic. Mature males are 30-40% longer and 4-5-5 times heavier than mature females. Flipper characteristics are unique. Top of foreflipper has bare skin, demarcated by sharp line where furstarts on wrist. Hindflippers are relatively longer than on any other otariids’ due to long thin extensions of cartilage on each toe. In both sexes, muzzle is short and curved downward, and nose is small. Ear pinnae are long and prominent and may become bare as an individual reaches an advanced age. Vibrissae are long, often extending past ears. Mature adult Northern Fur Seals have pale vibrissae, subadults have vibrissae that are a mix of pale and black, and young have black vibrissae. Adult males are stocky and have mane of long guard hairs from head to neck, chest, and upper back. Their foreheads appearto rise steeply because crown is enlarged by skull’s sagittal crest. Adult females and subadults are moderately built, and it is hard to determine gender until males reach 4-5 years of age and exceed size of females. Furis very thick, with pale-colored underfur. Males are gray to black, or fur may be dark ruddy brown, and mane may show silvery or blonde tints. Adult females and subadults have more variation in fur color but are often dark gray to black above with buff on chest, sides, and neck (where fur may form a pale, contrasting V-shape). Muzzle may be buffy or ruddy colored. Young are born with blackish coat, with some creamy areas on sides and face, and they molt to subadult color by 3-4 months old. Habitat. Highly pelagic, often far from shore or at edge of continental shelf or over continental slope. Terrestrial habitat usually consists of rocks and boulders, but it may also be a beach. Predators include Killer Whales (Orcinus orca), sharks, and Steller Sea Lions ( Eumetopias jubatus). Food and Feeding. Dietary shifts of Northern Fur Seals occur depending on season and foraging area; diets often includes vertically migrating species. Off California and Washington, Northern Fur Seals eat anchovy ( Engraulidae ), hake, saury ( Scomberesocidae ), squid, rockfish ( Sebastidae ), and salmon ( Salmonidae ). Off Alaska, they eat walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), capelin (Mallotus villosus), sand lance ( Ammodytidae ), herring ( Clupeidae ), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and squid. Breeding. All fur seals, including Northern Fur Seals, have a polygynous breeding system with the same general features. Males hold territories onshore and fight, vocalize, or make postural displays to maintain them. Mature males arrive first at a breeding rookery to establish a territory, followed by pregnant females. Almost always, more than one female will select a male’s territory and give birth to a single neonate soon after arriving. Non-breeding subadult males, referred to as bachelors, congregate outside territories at the edge of the rookery. Breeding males remain ashore continuously. A few days after parturition, a female leaves her neonate to go to sea on a foraging trip. Young are left alone or in a group of other unattended young, and males have no role in parenting. Territorial males may pose a threat to young, sometimes trampling or attacking them, but their presence can benefit young by keeping bachelors at bay and reducing crowding in the territory.

Typical values are 1500 cm and 45,000 kg for males and 1100 cm and 15,000 kg for females. Sperm Whales are the most sexually dimorphic of all cetaceans in body length and weight. They are primarily dark gray, but skin can appear dark brown when viewed in bright sunlight. Their enormous head constitutes about 25-33%of animal’s total body length. A single blowhole is located asymmetrically on the left side at the front end of the rostrum. Twentyto 26 pairs ofconical teeth erupt only on the narrow, under-slung lower jaw. Small eyes are set far back on the head. Smooth skin occurs on head and flippers and appears dimpled past the eyes. Sperm Whales have flat, paddle-shaped flippers andlarge, triangular-shapedflukes with relatively straight trailing edges.","Deep, ice-free ocean waters across the globe, and in deep semi-enclosed seas (e.g. Mediterranean) but not enclosed seas (e.g. Black and Red). Female Sperm Whales and their dependent young generally inhabit tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters deeper than 1000 m and with sea surface temperatures greater than c.15°C. Subadult and adult males range more widely; the range oflarge adult males includes ice-free deep waters near both poles that may beclose to 0°C.","Sperm Whales feed primarily on cephalopods. They are generalists, their prey being manyofthe larger, deep-ocean mesoand bathypelagic species. Preyincludes over 25 species of cephalopods, ranging from chiroteuthids weighing less than 100 g to giant squid (Architeuthis sp.) weighing over 400 kg, as well as over 60 species of bottom-dwelling fish ofvarious sizes. Males feed on larger species and larger individuals in the same taxa as females, and also on species foundat higher latitudes. Males are also more likely than females to prey onfish, sharks, and rays. In a single foraging dive, a female Sperm Whale will seize around 37 squid, consuming approximately 750 per day. Male Sperm Whales, their prey being larger, consume an estimated 350 squid per day. In general, foraging dives reach depths of 300-1200 m, andlast 30-45 minutes, but occasionally depths of 1000-2000 m may be achieved during dives of more than 60 minutes.","Prolonged breeding of Sperm Whales lasts from late winter through early summer. Sperm Whales in the Northern Hemisphere typically breed from January to August, with activity intensifying between March and June. In the Southern Hemisphere, breeding extends from July to March, peaking between September and December. The mating season of whales residing in tropical waters near the equator is unknown. Males reach sexual maturity by their late teens but do not participate in breeding activities until at least their late twenties when they reach social maturity. Female Sperm Whales are sexually mature by nine years and give birth to single young every 4-6 years; reproductive rates decline significantly with age. Gestation lasts for 14-16 months. Neonates weigh ¢.1000 kg and are ¢.400 cm long at birth. Weaning begins at two years, although individuals may continue suckling for manyyears. Maximumlongevity recorded is 77 years.","Sperm Whales spend ¢.75% oftheir lives foraging. Most foraging dives last 30-45 minutes and are 300-1200 m in depth, followed by 7-10 minutes at the surface. Young whales take shorter, shallower dives than adults. Female Sperm Whales staggerforaging dives, leaving some adults at surface to protect young. After foraging bouts, Sperm Whale social groups may gather at or nearthe surface for hours at a time. Sometimes individuals lay still and quiet, closely clustered or “logging,” apparently resting. At other times, they may be much more active, socializing with a great deal ofaerial behavior, emitting vocalizations called “codas” and creaks, and rolling about and touching one another. Large male Sperm Whales may also “log” quietly at the surface for long periods or socialize if they are with groups of females.","Female Sperm Whales are highly social and nomadic. They travel in long-termsocial units consisting of c.11 individuals, including adult females with and without offspring. They rely on allomaternal care, where females collectively care for offspring in the social group, even those that are not their own. In the Pacific Ocean, two or more social units from the same vocal clan mayjoin to form temporary groups. Vocal clans may be comprised of thousands of females with distinctive and culturally transmitted vocalizations, and can be sympatric. In the North Atlantic, social units rarely group with other units and vocal clans are geographically distinct. Female home ranges in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are estimated to span ¢.1500 km. At the surface, groups move c.4-7 km/h. Less 1s known about male sociality. Pubertal males leave their natal units at 4-21 years old and gather in loosely grouped bachelor groups. As they mature, males travel with fewer individuals. The largest males are frequently solitary and may be found from the tropics to near the polar ice edges.","CITES Appendix I.

Physeter macrocephalus Linnaeus, 1758 , “in Oceano Europao.” This species is monotypic. Distribution. Almost cosmopolitan, found from the edges of polar pack ice to the equator in both the Southern and Northern hemispheres. Descriptive notes. Total length 1520- 1920 cm (males) and 1040-1250 cm (females); up to more than 70,000 kg (males) and to 24,000 kg (females). Typical values are 1500 cm and 45,000 kg for males and 1100 cm and 15,000 kg for females. Sperm Whales are the most sexually dimorphic of all cetaceans in body length and weight. They are primarily dark gray, but skin can appear dark brown when viewed in bright sunlight. Their enormous head constitutes about 25-33%of animal’s total body length. A single blowhole is located asymmetrically on the left side at the front end of the rostrum. Twentyto 26 pairs ofconical teeth erupt only on the narrow, under-slung lower jaw. Small eyes are set far back on the head. Smooth skin occurs on head and flippers and appears dimpled past the eyes. Sperm Whales have flat, paddle-shaped flippers andlarge, triangular-shapedflukes with relatively straight trailing edges. Habitat. Deep, ice-free ocean waters across the globe, and in deep semi-enclosed seas (e.g. Mediterranean) but not enclosed seas (e.g. Black and Red). Female Sperm Whales and their dependent young generally inhabit tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters deeper than 1000 m and with sea surface temperatures greater than c.15°C. Subadult and adult males range more widely; the range oflarge adult males includes ice-free deep waters near both poles that may beclose to 0°C. Food and Feeding. Sperm Whales feed primarily on cephalopods. They are generalists, their prey being manyofthe larger, deep-ocean mesoand bathypelagic species. Preyincludes over 25 species of cephalopods, ranging from chiroteuthids weighing less than 100 g to giant squid (Architeuthis sp.) weighing over 400 kg, as well as over 60 species of bottom-dwelling fish ofvarious sizes. Males feed on larger species and larger individuals in the same taxa as females, and also on species foundat higher latitudes. Males are also more likely than females to prey onfish, sharks, and rays. In a single foraging dive, a female Sperm Whale will seize around 37 squid, consuming approximately 750 per day. Male Sperm Whales, their prey being larger, consume an estimated 350 squid per day. In general, foraging dives reach depths of 300-1200 m, andlast 30-45 minutes, but occasionally depths of 1000-2000 m may be achieved during dives of more than 60 minutes. Breeding. Prolonged breeding of Sperm Whales lasts from late winter through early summer. Sperm Whales in the Northern Hemisphere typically breed from January to August, with activity intensifying between March and June. In the Southern Hemisphere, breeding extends from July to March, peaking between September and December. The mating season of whales residing in tropical waters near the equator is unknown. Males reach sexual maturity by their late teens but do not participate in breeding activities until at least their late twenties when they reach social maturity. Female Sperm Whales are sexually mature by nine years and give birth to single young every 4-6 years; reproductive rates decline significantly with age. Gestation lasts for 14-16 months. Neonates weigh ¢.1000 kg and are ¢.400 cm long at birth. Weaning begins at two years, although individuals may continue suckling for manyyears. Maximumlongevity recorded is 77 years.

Individuals there tend to move slightly offshore during late afternoon and early evening, and return to inshore harbors and bays in morning. The population inhabiting the south-eastern coast of South Island does not show any diurnal movement patterns. In some areas, Hector’s Dolphin may also show some seasonal fluctuations in abundance, which likely reflect migration between more protected inshore waters in summer for breeding and more offshore waters (sometimes beyond 30 km from shore) in winter for feeding.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Hector’s Dolphin has one of the smallest distributions of any cetacean species, and a recent population viability analysis estimated a 74% decline in abundance between 1970 and 2009. The Maui’s Dolphinis classified as Critically Endangered because of very low abundance (c.111 individuals), concentration of most of the population in a small area, and an ongoing and projected decline of more than 80% in just three generations (c.39 years). Abundance of the South Island Hector’s Dolphin was estimated at 7270 individuals in 2004-2005 and more recently at 7873 individuals in 2012. The most concerning threat to Hector’s Dolphinis incidental catch in recreational gillnets. In the 1980s, at least 57 ind/year were killed incidentally, and most strandings are ofsingle individuals that bear injuries consistent with entanglement. Incidental catch in trawl nets has also been reported. Five marine mammal sanctuaries have been designated along coasts of New Zealand since then. The first of these, Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary, was created in 1989, and an extension toits offshore boundary from c.7 km to 22 km was implemented in 2010 to accommodate offshore movements of Hector’s Dolphins during winter. Stricter gillnet legislation was also enacted in 2008, banning gillnet use within 4-13 km ofshore along some areas of coastline. Prior to 2008, 110-150 Hector’s Dolphins were caught incidentally per year. Use of “pingers” in some areas has been moderately effective at protecting Hector’s Dolphins from fishing gear. Nevertheless, both subspecies are projected to continue declining unless fisheriesrelated mortality is brought to near zero. Without mortality caused by incidental catch, abundance could increase to ¢.15,000 individuals in the next 50 years. Because Hector’s Dolphins live close to human settlements, pollution may also be a threat. Moderate-tohigh concentrations of persistent organochlorine pollutants (e.g. DDT and PCBs) and heavy metals (e.g. mercury and cadmium) have been recorded in body tissues of Hector’s Dolphins, but their contribution to mortality and fecundity is currently unknown.","Baker et al.

Nevertheless, both subspecies are projected to continue declining unless fisheriesrelated mortality is brought to near zero. Without mortality caused by incidental catch, abundance could increase to ¢.15,000 individuals in the next 50 years. Because Hector’s Dolphins live close to human settlements, pollution may also be a threat. Moderate-tohigh concentrations of persistent organochlorine pollutants (e.g. DDT and PCBs) and heavy metals (e.g. mercury and cadmium) have been recorded in body tissues of Hector’s Dolphins, but their contribution to mortality and fecundity is currently unknown.

Although high levels of incidental catch of Northern Right-whale Dolphins in high-sea driftnet fisheries during the 1970s and 1980slikely reduced their abundance, the decline has been estimated to be less than 30%, and high-sea driftnet fishing has since been banned.

Although the 1993 United Nations’ moratorium on large-scale driftnets in the high seas has likely relieved some of the pressure, driftnets continue to be used inside exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the North Pacific Ocean. Illegal high-sea fishing is also an issue, especially because incidental catch rates are unknown. Instances of entanglement of Northern Right-whale Dolphins continue to be reported in the western Pacific Ocean. They were once commonly taken as incidental catch in California driftnet fisheries for broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus). At least 386 individuals were caught in 1990-2002. Catch rates in Pacific US fisheries have dropped to only c.3-8 ind/year. The Northern Right-whale Dolphin was also taken directly in fisheries offJapan as far back as the 1950s, and it continues to be killed opportunistically, although the fisheries now tend to target other small cetaceans.","Carretta et al.

Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Although high levels of incidental catch of Northern Right-whale Dolphins in high-sea driftnet fisheries during the 1970s and 1980slikely reduced their abundance, the decline has been estimated to be less than 30%, and high-sea driftnet fishing has since been banned. There are ¢.68,000 individuals across the North Pacific Ocean and 9000-21,000 individuals along the western USA. Incidental catch rates in squid fisheries from Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea in the North Pacific Ocean have been extremely high in the past. An estimated 15,000-24,000 Northern Right Whale Dolphins were killed per year in these fisheries during the 1980s, depleting the population to 24-73% of its abundance before exploitation. Although the 1993 United Nations’ moratorium on large-scale driftnets in the high seas has likely relieved some of the pressure, driftnets continue to be used inside exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the North Pacific Ocean. Illegal high-sea fishing is also an issue, especially because incidental catch rates are unknown. Instances of entanglement of Northern Right-whale Dolphins continue to be reported in the western Pacific Ocean. They were once commonly taken as incidental catch in California driftnet fisheries for broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus). At least 386 individuals were caught in 1990-2002. Catch rates in Pacific US fisheries have dropped to only c.3-8 ind/year. The Northern Right-whale Dolphin was also taken directly in fisheries offJapan as far back as the 1950s, and it continues to be killed opportunistically, although the fisheries now tend to target other small cetaceans.

Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. No overall abundance estimates or population trends for the False Killer Whale are currently available, but it seems to be naturally uncommon,likely making it vulnerable to localized threats. Declines that may result from this vulnerability suggest that a 30% global reduction in abundance over the next three generations is a possibility. Abundance is ¢.16,000 individuals off coastal waters of China and Japan; ¢.298,800 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean; ¢.777 individuals in the northern Gulf of Mexico; and ¢.1329 individuals in the Palmyra Atoll. Numbers of resident False Killer Whales around Hawaii are estimated at only 123 individuals. Incidental catch of the False Killer Whale, which occurs throughout its distribution, is probably the most worrisome threat, and monitoring is currently minimal. Incidental catches occur off northern Australia and the Andaman Islands and in Brazilian gillnet fisheries and purse-seine fisheries in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Coastal Chinese fisheries may take several hundred individuals per year in gillnet and trawl fisheries. The False Killer Whale is also vulnerable to long-line fisheries, which are common throughout the central and western tropical Pacific Ocean. Individuals occasionally become hooked when they try to ingest prey items from the lines. Even if an individual escapes, wounds to its gullet from hooks may be lethal. Fishermen sometimes injure or kill False Killer Whales because they take prey items from fishing gear. For example, 900 individuals were killed in 1965-1980 in a culling drive around Iki Island, Japan, to reduce competition with the yellowtail fishery. False Killer Whales are also taken as direct catch off ofJapan and in the Caribbean for meat and cooking oil, and in the past, they were targets of a drive fishery operating off the PenghuIslands of Taiwan. Molecular monitoring of whale meat sold in South Korea has also revealed a high frequency of False Killer Whale meat in local markets. It is taken opportunistically in waters offJapan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and the West Indies. Some individuals caught alive in the Taiwanese and Japanese fisheries have been sold for captive display in aquaria.

An accumulation of genetic evidence, in addition to ecological and morphological differences, supports separate species status for these two types. Monotypic.","Limited to the Amazon River Basin and most ofits tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It may also extend into the Orinoco River system in Venezuela, but itis uncertain if sightings there were this species or the Guiana Dolphin (S. guianensus).","Total length up to 149 cm (males) and up to 152 cm (females); weight up to 52 kg. Neonates are thought to be 70-80 cm long. The Tucuxi is similar in appearance to bottlenose dolphins (7ursiops spp.), and it is smaller than its coastal counterpart, the Guiana Dolphin. Body shape of the Tucuxi is robust with long, narrow beak, wide flippers, and short, triangular dorsal fin. A visible crease separating melon and beak is characteristically absent in this genus. Most skin on dorsum is dark gray, with slight blue or brown tinge that fades into pale gray or white with pink tinge on belly and lower jaw. Dark gray band extends from behind eye to base of flipper. There tends to be more pale lateral pigmentation on posterior one-half of body and tail than in front of dorsal fin. Flukes and flippers are dark gray on both sides. There are 28-35 pairs of small, conical teeth in upperjaw and 26-33 pairs in lower jaw.","Exclusively freshwater, riverine habitats (the only delphinid to be so limited). The Tucuxi is found in the Amazon River Basin and may be found as far inland as southern Peru, eastern Ecuador, and south-eastern Colombia. Water turbidity and pH do not appearto affect distribution of the Tucuxi, and sightings have been made in all three of the Amazon Basin’s main river types: whitewater (sedimentrich), clearwater, and blackwater (acidic). Nevertheless, unlike the Amazon River Dolphin (/nia geoffrensis), the Tucuxi generally does not enter flood zones, and it has not been observed in rivers less than 3 m deep or in lakes less than 1-8 m deep. Tucuxis are less abundant in rapids and turbulent water and are most common at river junctions where current is mild. Impassable shallow areas, rapids, and waterfalls likely segment populations of Tucuxis throughout the Amazon Basin. Areas where whitewater and blackwater mix tend to be ecologically productive and seem especially preferred by the Tucuxi. Habitat hotspots include areas within 200 m of riverbanks, riverjunctions, and lakes.","Some 30 species of freshwater fish in 13 families have been documented as prey of the Tucuxi; curimatids (toothless characins), sciaenids (croakers), and Siluriformes (catfish) seem to be preferred. The Tucuxi will forage only for relatively small species and age classes, usually no longer than 35 cm. Foraging activity is more frequently seen during the low-water season when fish become confined to the Amazon River Basin’s major tributaries. During the flood season, prey species move into flood zones to feed, but unlike the Amazon River Dolphin, the Tucuxi does not enter these areas. Tucuxis may forage alone or in groups.","Breeding peaks during the low-water season in September—November. Gestation is c¢.11 months. Sexual maturity is reached at lengths of 132-134 cm for males and c.140 cm for females. A high ratio of testes mass to body mass (c.5%) suggests that the Tucuxi has a promiscuous mating system, dependent on sperm competition. Tucuxis may live at least 30-35 years; a recent estimate suggests that some individuals live beyond 40 years.","Feeding and traveling of Tucuxis are the most commonly observed behaviors, and individuals may be observed “porpoising” while swimming at faster speeds. Movements of the Tucuxi into lake systems from rivers appear to fluctuate diurnally; groups tend to move into lakes twice daily, in the early morning and late afternoon. Dives last 1-5-2 minutes, and individuals generally spend very little time at the surface. The Tucuxi is vocally active and has a wide repertoire of whistles and echolocation clicks. Variation in click structure over the Amazon River Basin may reflect geographical variation and population structure. Tucuxis are not known to bow-ride and rarely approach boats, but they are sometimes observed to spy-hop and perform somersaulting leaps.","The Tucuxi has a social structure similar to that of the Guiana Dolphin. Groups of one to four individuals are most common, but groups of up to 20 individuals have been reported. Group sizes are larger on average at riverjunctions and in lakes. Although the Tucuxiis sympatric with the Amazon River Dolphin, the two species are rarely observed to interact. Maximum known movement of Tucuxis is 130 km, and some individuals move up to 56 km/day. Their distribution is primarily driven by seasonal fluctuations in river levels. Lake systems that may be too small or restricted by channels that are too shallow during the lowwater season become accessible during the flood season. The Tucuxi also spends more time at river junctions during the low-water season, likely because these are strategic places to forage.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Because the Tucuxi is now recognized as a separate species, distinct from the Guiana Dolphin,its endemism to the Amazon River Basin has increased conservation importance. Data evaluating risks of population decline are scarce, and there are currently no estimates of total abundance. Local estimates of abundance and density are often inconsistent and arrived at by varying methods. Some of the latest abundance estimates surveying the largest area of the Amazon River Basin (2704 km) are 1545 individuals in Colombia, 2205 individuals in Venezuela (although whether dolphins in the Orinoco are Tucuxis or Guiana Dolphins is uncertain), 1319 individuals in Peru, and only 19 individuals in Ecuador. These dolphins tend to be most abundant in lakes and riverjunctions and within 200 m of riverbanks, so such areas have been suggested as critical habitat for both the Tucuxi and the Amazon River Dolphin. Proximity of Tucuxis to human activity means they are especially vulnerable to threats from fisheries, boat traffic, contaminants, and residential and industrial waste; harmful interactions with local fisheries are of greatest concern. Direct competition between Tucuxis and these fisheries is minimal because not all preferred prey species of the Tucuxi have high commercial value. Only 14 of 30 commercially viable prey species in the Amazon River have been documented as Tucuxi prey. Tucuxis are not directly caught due to local superstitions surrounding them, but increased fishing intensity in the Amazon River Basin has led to increased rates of incidental catch. Tucuxis seem especially susceptible to entanglement in monofilament gillnets, which are most commonly used in the high-productivity areas where they most abundant. Tucuxis are also often caught in seine nets and shrimp traps. River damming for hydroelectric projects contributes to habitat degradation and has the potential to disrupt gene flow among Tucuxi populations in the Amazon River Basin. Mitochondrial genetic diversity of the Tucuxi throughout its distribution appears to be high, suggesting a fairly large effective population size and a high amount of female gene flow; connectivity among regions of the Amazon River Basin is important for continued population health. Up to 200 dams have been proposed along the Amazon River's major tributaries, which would fragment populations of many species, including the Tucuxi, the Amazon River Dolphin, and their prey. Industrial and agricultural activity in the Basin also contributes to both habitat degradation and pollution. Several potential pollutants, which are banned elsewhere, continue to be used in South America. For example, mercury is still used to refine fluvial gold, and Brazil is one of the world’s top pesticide consumers. Such pollutants enter the Amazon River Basin and food webs via runoff, and recent studies in Brazil indicate high levels of PCBs and PBDEs in prey species of the Tucuxi; data on levels of such pollutants in Tucuxis are scarce. Noise pollution may also be a growing concern because use of outboard engines in the Amazon River Basin has increased, and in some areas, explosives are illegally used for fishing. Other threats may include boat collisions, oil spills, and overexploitation of prey species.","Caballero et al.

Group sizes are larger on average at riverjunctions and in lakes. Although the Tucuxiis sympatric with the Amazon River Dolphin, the two species are rarely observed to interact. Maximum known movement of Tucuxis is 130 km, and some individuals move up to 56 km/day. Their distribution is primarily driven by seasonal fluctuations in river levels. Lake systems that may be too small or restricted by channels that are too shallow during the lowwater season become accessible during the flood season. The Tucuxi also spends more time at river junctions during the low-water season, likely because these are strategic places to forage. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Because the Tucuxi is now recognized as a separate species, distinct from the Guiana Dolphin,its endemism to the Amazon River Basin has increased conservation importance. Data evaluating risks of population decline are scarce, and there are currently no estimates of total abundance. Local estimates of abundance and density are often inconsistent and arrived at by varying methods. Some of the latest abundance estimates surveying the largest area of the Amazon River Basin (2704 km) are 1545 individuals in Colombia, 2205 individuals in Venezuela (although whether dolphins in the Orinoco are Tucuxis or Guiana Dolphins is uncertain), 1319 individuals in Peru, and only 19 individuals in Ecuador. These dolphins tend to be most abundant in lakes and riverjunctions and within 200 m of riverbanks, so such areas have been suggested as critical habitat for both the Tucuxi and the Amazon River Dolphin. Proximity of Tucuxis to human activity means they are especially vulnerable to threats from fisheries, boat traffic, contaminants, and residential and industrial waste; harmful interactions with local fisheries are of greatest concern. Direct competition between Tucuxis and these fisheries is minimal because not all preferred prey species of the Tucuxi have high commercial value. Only 14 of 30 commercially viable prey species in the Amazon River have been documented as Tucuxi prey. Tucuxis are not directly caught due to local superstitions surrounding them, but increased fishing intensity in the Amazon River Basin has led to increased rates of incidental catch. Tucuxis seem especially susceptible to entanglement in monofilament gillnets, which are most commonly used in the high-productivity areas where they most abundant. Tucuxis are also often caught in seine nets and shrimp traps. River damming for hydroelectric projects contributes to habitat degradation and has the potential to disrupt gene flow among Tucuxi populations in the Amazon River Basin. Mitochondrial genetic diversity of the Tucuxi throughout its distribution appears to be high, suggesting a fairly large effective population size and a high amount of female gene flow; connectivity among regions of the Amazon River Basin is important for continued population health. Up to 200 dams have been proposed along the Amazon River's major tributaries, which would fragment populations of many species, including the Tucuxi, the Amazon River Dolphin, and their prey. Industrial and agricultural activity in the Basin also contributes to both habitat degradation and pollution. Several potential pollutants, which are banned elsewhere, continue to be used in South America. For example, mercury is still used to refine fluvial gold, and Brazil is one of the world’s top pesticide consumers. Such pollutants enter the Amazon River Basin and food webs via runoff, and recent studies in Brazil indicate high levels of PCBs and PBDEs in prey species of the Tucuxi; data on levels of such pollutants in Tucuxis are scarce. Noise pollution may also be a growing concern because use of outboard engines in the Amazon River Basin has increased, and in some areas, explosives are illegally used for fishing. Other threats may include boat collisions, oil spills, and overexploitation of prey species. Bibliography. Caballero et al.

They are taken by harpoon off Margarita Island in eastern Venezuela and occasionally in Japanese drive fisheries. They are also taken opportunistically off north-eastern Taiwan and incidentally in Taiwanese oceanic driftnets. Observed lesions and scars on LLong-beaked Common Dolphins from bycatch indicate that there are violent interactions with fisheries off Peru. It is frequently caught in purse-seine fisheries there, although catch rates have diminished since 1994. They are only rarely caught incidentally in tuna purse-seine fisheries in the tropical Pacific Ocean and not to the same extent as the Short-beaked Common Dolphin. They are also occasionally caught in driftnet fisheries for broadbill swordfish (Xiphia gladius) and common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) off California and in gillnet, trawl, and purse-seine fisheries in Indian and Chinese waters. Marine pollution may also be a threat to the LLong-beaked Common Dolphin in some areas. High organochlorine concentrations (primarily DDT and PCBs) have been found in blubber of Long-beaked Common Dolphins caught in Brazilian waters. These contaminants likely come from heavily industrialized areas along the Brazilian coast. High concentrations of heavy metals, primarily zinc, cadmium, and mercury, have also been found in livers and kidneys of Long-beaked Common Dolphins in the Sea ofJapan off South Korea. Bibliography.

Nevertheless, taxonomy of D. delphis is currently uncertain. There is a distinct form in the Black Sea that is distinguished by skull morphology and microsatellite DNA that is classified as a subspecies, although its taxonomic status is still unclear. There is also a genetically divergent population in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is not classified as a separate subspecies. Two subspecies recognized.","D.d.delphisLinnaeus,1758—primarilyoffshoretropicaltotemperatewatersofAtlanticandPacificoceans,includingsomeenclosedseassuchasSeaofOkhotsk,SeaofJapan,andMediterraneanSea,butexcludingGulfofMexico,CaribbeanSea,andIndianOcean. D. d. ponticus Barabash-Nikiforov, 1935 — Black Sea and adjoining Marmara Sea, excluding Sea of Azov.","Total length 170-230 cm (males) and 160-220 cm (females); weight up to 200 kg. Neonates are 80-93 cm long. Individual Short-beaked Common Dolphins in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean are slightly larger and be up to 270 cm total body length. The Short-beaked Common Dolphin has moderately tall, falcate dorsal fin with a pointed tip. It has slightly more robust build and shorter beak than the Long-beaked Common Dolphin ( D. capensis ) and has more rounded melon. Flippers are small and slender, with pointed tips. Some adults, likely males, possess post-anal protrusion. Dorsal surface of body is dark brown or gray, which contrasts white belly. Flanks have distinct hourglass pattern consisting of yellowish or ocher anterior patch and pale-gray patch on tailstock. Midpoint of hourglass shape occurs below dorsal fin. Flippers and dorsal fin may range in color from almost white to dark gray, although dorsal fin will often have paler central patch. Lips are black, and dark stripe extends from chin below mouth to flipperjoint. Another dark stripe runs along crease between beak and melon and extends posteriorly to encircle eyes. Pale stripe runs along forehead from anterior apex of melon to blowhole. Young Short-beaked Common Dolphins tend to have more muted color pattern. There is a rare color morph where the usually yellowish thoracic patch is dark gray. Each jaw contains 41-57 pairs of sharp, conical teeth. The “Black Sea Common Dolphin” (D. d. ponticus) is a dwarf form that has a maximum length of 219 cm; average length is ¢.162 cm for males and 158 cm for females. This form also has shorter beak than nominate form, containing fewer teeth, 41-52 pairs in each jaw.","Tends to be more common in offshore than near-shore waters and generally not found in areas less than 180 m deep. The Short-beaked Common Dolphin is especially abundant in regions associated with strong upwelling, such as over continental shelves or regions where seafloor is steep and sloping. Preferred surface temperature seems to be 10-20°C, and groups may occasionally follow warm water currents outside of its usual latitudinal distribution. The Short-beaked Common Dolphin is rare or absent throughout most of the Indian Ocean and tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean, and it is not known to occur in the Caribbean Basin or Gulf of Mexico. The Black Sea Common Dolphin tends to prefer more offshore waters with lower salinity, but it will seasonally follow migrating prey species into more near-shore water.","The Short-beaked Common Dolphin feeds primarily on small, schooling, mesopelagic fish and squid such as scombroids (e.g. mackerel), clupeoids (e.g. herring), and California market squid ( Doryteuthis opalescens). In the Western Atlantic Ocean, oceanic populations tend to have diets more dominated with cephalopods than near-shore populations. North Atlantic populations of Short-beaked Common Dolphins prefer myctophid fish (lanternfish), and diets of South African populations tend to be dominated by South African pilchard ( Sardinops sagax ocellatus). Off eastern New Zealand, Short-beaked Common Dolphins prefer yellowtail horse mackerel (Trachurus novaezelandiae), kahawai (Arripis trutta), yellow-eyed mullet ( Aldrichetta forsteri), flying fish ( Cheilopogon pinnatibarbatus), parore (Girella tricuspidata), and garfish (Hyporamphus thi). In some areas, such as off southern California, Short-beaked Common Dolphins feed nocturnally in association with the rising deep scattering layer. Anchovies ( Engraulidae ) and squid are dominant prey in winter, and smelt ( Argentinidae ) and lanternfish are dominant in spring and summer. Short-beaked Common Dolphins sometimes forage cooperatively, and foraging dives up to 200 m have been recorded.","In the North Pacific Ocean, breeding of the Short-beaked Common Dolphin peaks in spring and summer; it peaks in summer in the Black Sea. Minimal sexual dimorphism and large testes size relative to body size in males suggests a promiscuous mating system dependent on sperm competition. In the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic oceans, sexual maturity is reached at 6-8 years in females and 7-12 years in males. The Black Sea Common Dolphin appears to reach sexual maturity much earlier at 2-4 years in females and c.3 years in males. Reproductive females will have an offspring every 1-3 years but may occasionally become pregnant while still lactating. Gestation is 10-11-7 months. Longevity is thought to be ¢.30 years for both sexes.","The Short-beaked Common Dolphin can be aerially active, especially in large groups; they frequently leap out of the water while traveling. They also will bow-ride vessels and sometimes even large mysticetes.","Group sizes of Short-beaked Common Dolphins are ¢.10-10,000 individuals. Larger groups consist of smaller subgroups that are likely segregated by sex and age classes. The Short-beaked Common Dolphin has been observed in mixed-species groups with Risso’s Dolphin ( Grampus griseus ), pilot whales ( Globicephala spp. ), the Striped Dolphin ( Stenella coeruleoalba ), and various species of Lagenorhynchus . In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, they also occasionally associate with yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares), making them susceptible to the tuna purse-seine industry. In some regions, abundance is known to vary seasonally. Off southern California, for example, the Short-beaked Common Dolphin is most abundant in summer through autumn and in mid-winter. These populations seem to prefer traveling over underwater escarpments in a north-south direction along the western Californian and Mexican coasts. Off New Zealand, sea-surface temperature may affect seasonal movements; Short-beaked Common Dolphins occur ¢.9-2 km offshore in spring and summer but 20-3 km off shore in autumn. This movement is likely correlated with migrating temperature-dependent prey species. Movements have also been associated with temperature in the western North Atlantic Ocean, where Short-beaked Common Dolphins are most abundant in nearshore Nova Scotia in July, coincident with seasonalrising sea-surface temperature.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The subpopulation of Short-beaked Common Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea is classified as Endangered because it has suffered a marked decline and has almost completely disappeared from large portions ofits former range (e.g. Provencal Basin, Balearic Sea, Ligurian Sea, and northern Adriatic Sea). The Black Sea Common Dolphin is classified as Vulnerable. No estimates of total abundance of the Short-beaked Common Dolphin are currently available, but there are ¢.2,963,000 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, ¢.352,000 individuals off western USA, ¢.63,400 individuals in European continental shelf waters, ¢.121,000 individuals in the western North Atlantic Ocean, and ¢.19,400 individuals in the western Mediterranean Sea. Several populations face local threats, but as a whole, the Short-beaked Common Dolphin is abundant and likely not declining. The population in the Mediterranean Sea, however, has been in sharp decline over the last few decades, especially in the northern Adriatic and eastern Ionian seas. Although now directly caught in only a few fisheries (mainly Japanese), the Short-beaked Common Dolphin was hunted historically until the 1980s and 1990s in Turkey, the USSR, Peru, Spain, and France.Its greatest threat currently is incidental catch. In fact, the Short-beaked Common Dolphin is one of the most common species in bycatch in pelagic purse-seine and drift-net fisheries, due to its abundance and association with large pelagic fish such as tuna. Catch limits imposed by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission and resulting emphasis on dolphin release and safety gear have probably reduced mortality of Short-beaked Common Dolphins in tuna purse-seine fisheries by 97% since 1986 (incidental take was 24,307 individuals that year). This fishery killed only 325 Short-beaked Common Dolphins in 2005. Between 1990 and 2002, 21,000 Shortbeaked Common Dolphins were killed in pelagic driftnetfisheries targeting broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and common thresher shark (Alopias vulpinus) off California. Acoustic “pingers” may be effective in deterring marine mammals, including the Short-beaked Common Dolphin, from these driftnets. Large-scale driftnet fishing that targets broadbill swordfish still occurs illegally on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar, where 12,000-15,000 Short-beaked Common Dolphins are killed per year; most of the fleet operates from Morocco. For Short-beaked Common Dolphins, this take likely exceeds 10% of the local population size, making it unsustainable. The Short-beaked Common Dolphin is also killed incidentally in small-scale gillnet, trawl, and purse-seine fisheries throughout its distribution, including Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea, off north-western Africa, South America, New Zealand, and north Atlantic Ocean. Off northern Portugal, 52% of common dolphin strandings are due to either confirmed bycatch or harmful interactions with fishing gear, contributing to an estimated 44% of the local population’s mortality. High rates of bycatch of Short-beaked Common Dolphins also occur in UK and French pelagic pair-trawl sea bass fisheries. Although small-scale, these fisheries are estimated to have killed at least 800 dolphins in 2000-2005. The southern Australia population of the Short-beaked Common Dolphin, which appears to be genetically distinct from the nearby Tasmanian population, may be especially vulnerable to incidental catch in local purse-seine fisheries. In 2004-2005, for example, 377 Short-beaked Common Dolphins were killed in only seven months. Considering the population’s genetic distinctness, this catch rate may not be sustainable. The Short-beaked Common Dolphin is currently rare in the Adriatic Sea and has likely been steadily declining since the 1800s due to culling campaigns, which continued into the 1960s, and to more recent habitat degradation. Heavy metal and organochlorine contamination may also be a problem in some areas. For example, there are high PCB concentrations in c.40% of female Short-beaked Common Dolphins in the Atlantic Ocean off Europe. High concentrations of cadmium have also been documented in kidneys of Shortbeaked Common Dolphins off South Australia, and they have been correlated with various pathological problems such as proteinuria (excess serum proteins in urine). Overfishing of prey species (primarily anchovy and sprat) is a major threat to Shortbeaked Common Dolphins in the Black and Mediterranean seas. There is no reliable estimate of abundance for the Black Sea Common Dolphin. At least 159,000-161,000 Black Sea Common Dolphins were killed in 1962-1983 before Turkey banned small cetacean hunting. Priorto this, from the 1930s to the 1960s, the USSR, Romania, and Bulgaria took c.1-5 million Black Sea Common Dolphins before commercial hunting of small cetaceans was banned by these countries in 1966. Black Sea Common Dolphins are also threatened by habitat degradation and overfishing of prey species, which likely increased their susceptibility to infection during a morbillivirus epizootic in 1994. Decline of the Black Sea Common Dolphin has been inferred based on the combined impact of these threats. On following pages: 11. Long-beaked Common Dolphin ( Delphinus capensis ); 12.

Three distinct ecotypes have also been identified in Antarctic waters (types A, B, and C) that may correspond to putative species previously proposed in the 1980s ( O. nanus and O. glacialis ). Recent molecular studies strongly suggest that these three ecotypes warrant species designation. A fourth type (type D) has also been newly described from New Zealand area. Monotypic.","The most widely distributed of all cetaceans, found in almost any marine environment from the Equator to both polar zones, including semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of California, Sea of Okhotsk, Yellow Sea, Sea ofJapan, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Ross Sea.","Total length up to 980 cm (males) and up to 770 cm (females); weight up to 6600 kg (males) and up to 4700 kg (females). Neonates are 210-260 cm long and weigh 160-180 kg. The Killer Whale is the largest member of Delphinidae and is one of the most distinctive and easily recognizable cetaceans. Body is robust but streamlined, with tall dorsal fin, large paddle-shaped flippers, and blunt, poorly defined beak. It is strongly sexually dimorphic in size and morphology. Females and immature individuals have falcate dorsal fins, which may have slightly rounded tips. Adult males have much taller (up to 180 cm) dorsal fins than females (up to 80 cm) that are triangular in shape and may slant slightly forward in some geographical forms, giving the appearance of backward placement. Adult males also have larger flippers than females, and fluke tips of some older males are curved downward. Lowerjaw and ventral area up to urogenital region is white, with two lobes curving up onto flanks anterior to genital slit and behind dorsal fin. Undersides of flukes are also white, and there are white patches above eyes. Rest of body is black except for gray saddle patch behind dorsal fin. Some geographical forms have distinctive gray line extending from lower point of saddle patch toward head, making a curved “cape” shape. Young individuals tend to have a more muted pattern, with white areas tinged slightly yellow or orange. There are 10-14 pairs of large, conical teeth (up to 10 cm long) in each jaw, although they may be worn down and damaged in older individuals. There are three ecotypes known from north-western coasts of North America, including Alaska. REsI-DENT. The resident Killer Whale has dorsal fin with rounded tip, medium-sized oval eye patch oriented horizontally, no distinct cape pattern, and saddle patch that can be open (with black pigmentation incurring into gray saddle) or closed, with tip extending no further than middle of dorsal fin base. TRANSIENT. The transient Killer Whale is generally larger in size than the resident Killer Whale, has pointed dorsal fin tip, no dorsal cape pattern, medium-sized oval eye patch oriented horizontally, and closed saddle patch with tip that can extend as far forward as anterior edge of dorsal fin base. OrrsHORE. The recently described offshore Killer Whale is genetically distinct from, but similar in appearance to, the resident form, although it tends to be smaller and females have rounded dorsal fin tips. Three morphologically, ecologically, and genetically distinct types have also been identified in Antarctic waters. Type A. This type of Killer Whale is circumpolar in Antarctic waters and is similar in appearance to forms in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Tyre B. This type of Killer Whale is known primarily from Antarctic and subantarctic waters and is generally smaller than the type A Killer Whale. This type possesses dorsal cape pattern, large horizontally oriented eye patch, and closed saddle patch. A build-up of diatoms on skin may give white areas a yellowish hue. Type C. This type of Killer Whale is a dwarf form, reaching average lengths 1-3 m shorter than the other types and is restricted to Antarctic waters. Like the type B Killer Whale, type C has distinct dorsal cape, generally closed saddle patch, and pale yellow patches. Eye patch, however, is small and slanted at 45° angle to horizontal body axis. A fourth type (TYPE D) has been described very recently from a mass stranding event on New Zealand in 1955 and several sightings at sea since 2004. An extremely small eye patch characterizes this type.","Cosmopolitan in marine habitats but somewhat more abundant at higher latitudes and in near-shore waters, especially in regions of high productivity. The Killer Whale has been documented, on rare occasions, to move into river mouths. Most observations have been within 800 km of shoreline. The Killer Whale is less abundant in lower tropical latitudes and in the ice-pack zones of the high Arctic and Antarctic oceans. In the Canadian Arctic Ocean, however, the Killer Whale is becoming seasonally more abundant as pack-ice extent and duration decline with global climate change. Resident, transient, and offshore forms of Killer Whales are most well known from populations on the north-western coast of North America, including the Aleutian Islands, and there is good evidence to suggest that, in that area at least, they may each warrant full species status. Resident Killer Whales are the most near-shore distributed of the three forms, given that they feed primarily on salmon migrating into freshwater areas to spawn. The type B Killer Whale is found primarily in Antarctic regions, usually among ice floes concentrated around the Antarctic Peninsula, although their distribution may extend up to the Falkland Islands and New Zealand. The type CKiller Whale appears to be restricted to Antarctic waters and prefers the pack-ice habitats in eastern Antarctica. The recently described type D Killer Whale is subantarctic and is most abundant between 40° S and 60° S.","The Killer Whale is an apex predator. Globally, it is a generalist with a diverse diet. There are over 140 species of documented prey including a wide variety of small and large fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and marine turtles. The Killer Whale is the only cetacean species known to have populations that specialize on mammal prey. Over 50 different species of mammals have been documented as prey including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sirenians, mustelids, and occasionally even ungulates and ursids. On a local scale, populations of Killer Whales are often distinguished by dietary specializations. For example, resident Killer Whales in the north-western coast of North America feed almost exclusively on salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and are not known to feed on endothermic animals. They appearto prefer the largest and most fat-rich species (Chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha, and Cohosalmon, O. kisutch), despite smaller species such as sockeye salmon (0. nerka) occurring in greater abundance. Transient Killer Whales in the same area, by contrast, hunt marine mammals and do not consume fish. Preferred prey include Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina), Harbor Porpoises ( Phocoena phocoena ), and Dall’s Porpoises ( Phocoenoides dalli), and they will also eat Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopiasjubatus), California Sea Lions (Zalophus californianus), Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris), Pacific White-sided Dolphins ( Lagenorhynchus obliquidens ), and Common Minke Whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). Transient Killer Whales off the coast of California specialize on Gray Whales (Eschrichtius robustus) and will attack young that are accompanying their mothers northward on their first migration. Dietary preference of offshore Killer Whales is currently poorly known but appears to include more offshore fish species such as Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and various carcharinid sharks. Resident, transient, and offshore killer whales, although partially sympatric in their distributions, do not appearto associate with each other and are unambiguously distinct in mtDNA and nDNA composition. Given their dietary specializations, this genetic divergenceis likely the result of foraging strategies being socially passed across generations. This would have eventually given rise to divergent enough skill-sets so as to underlie mutually exclusive lifestyles, making for an intriguing and rare case where ecological divergence is likely driving incipient sympatric speciation. Populations of Killer Whales that inhabit Norwegian fjords specialize on herring ( Clupea spp. ) and behaviorally resemble resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. The Antarctic type A Killer Whale specializes on the Antarctic Minke Whale (B. bonaerensis), and type B populations in the vicinity of New Zealand may specialize on sharks and other elasmobranchs. The type C Killer Whale feeds primarily on Antarctic fish species, and some populations of type D Killer Whale are thought to prefer Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). In the Canadian Arctic, Killer Whales most commonly prey on the Beluga (Delphinapterusleucas) , the Narwhal ( Monodon monoceros), and the Bowhead Whale (Balaena mysticetus). In multiple populations, dietary specialization has led to development of unique foraging strategies. For example, Norwegian populations of Killer Whales use a strategy called “carousel feeding,” during which a school ofherring is herded into a tight ball near the water’s surface. Individual whales then stun and pick at prey around edges of the ball. Killer Whales in the Strait of Gibraltar feed on Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus) by chasing schools for ¢.30 minutes at high speed until tuna are exhausted. Transient Killer Whales usually hunt in small groups and are more acoustically quiet than resident Killer Whales, likely to keep from alerting their mammalian prey. Killing seals and sea lions usually involves repeated ramming, slapping them with flukes, or even leaping on them. After prey is stunned,it is dragged underwater and drowned. The killed animal is then shared among the group. Killer Whales may herd large groups of dolphins or porpoises into confined bays where they can be easily killed after being trapped (a strategy that is disturbingly reminiscent of human dolphin drives). Larger groups of transient Killer Whales are required to successfully attack mysticetes and the Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus). The group will coordinate itself so that some individuals grasp flippers and tail flukes of prey to impede movement while others gash at the blowhole area to impair breathing. Blubber,lips, and tongue are usually the only parts of the killed whale that are consumed. Groups of type B Killer Whale in Antarctica have learned how to coordinate forceful water waves to wash over and tilt ice floes to dislodge Weddell Seals (Leptonychotes weddelliz) resting on them. When this wave-washing technique fails, one or two Killer Whales may even lift the ice floe with their heads to flip it over or break it. Killer Whales off Patagonia, Argentina, have developed a strategy for hunting young Southern Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina) and South American Sea Lions (Otaria byronia) that involves intentionally stranding themselves temporarily on the sloping beaches. Killer Whales around the Crozet Islands use a similar method, and in this region, there is compelling evidence to suggest that adults actively teach this strategy to their offspring.","Off the Pacific coast of North America, breeding peaks in October—March but may occur throughout the year. In the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, breeding peaks between late fall and mid-winter. Most life history data are drawn from resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean and may not be typical of all populations of Killer Whales. Mating is endogamous in resident Killer Whales, occurring when males briefly leave their matrilines to mate with females from other pods within the same social clan, usually during on temporary merging of pods (superpod). Clans are culturally distinguished by different vocal dialects that reflect the degree to which pods and matrilines are related and may serve as important communicative cues for avoiding inbreeding. Gestation period of the Killer Whale is one of the longest among mammals, lasting 15-18 months, and the birthing interval lasts c.5 years. Young are weaned at 1-3 years of age and reach sexual maturity at 10-15 years for females and c.15 years for males. Males do not reach full physical maturity until c.21 years. Males may live up to 50-60 years, and females may live up to 80-90 years. Females will give birth to an average of five viable offspring during their lifetimes and become menopausal at c.40 years. The Killer Whale is one of only a handful of mammalian species, including humans, with well-documented, post-reproductive female longevity. As a species with a matrilineal social structure, post-reproductive female longevity may contribute fitness benefits to offspring and grand-offspring via amassed stores of socially transferrable knowledge. Such knowledge could include long-term awareness of prey distribution and movements. Socially derived survival advantages that are dependent on long-term memory stores or experience thus provide evolutionary pressure forfemales to live beyond reproductive age.","Foraging and traveling are the most common behaviorsin all studied populations of Killer Whales. Resident Killer Whales spend a much higher proportion of their time foraging and traveling (90-95%) than do transient Killer Whales (60-70%) that spend more time socializing and resting. Herring-specialist populations of Killer Whales off northern Norway have an activity budget very similar to that of resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean, suggesting that the proportion of time spent traveling and foraging depends heavily on preferred prey type. Resident Killer Whales have seasonal inshore—offshore movements associated with migrating salmon and forage in bouts of 2-3 hours. Pods move in a consistent direction at a mean swimming speed of ¢.6 km/h, with individuals widely spread out. Caught prey may be shared among small subgroups or among mothers and offspring. Resident Killer Whales tend to be vocally quiet while foraging, repeating discrete calls drawn from an average repertoire of twelve call types per pod. Diving patterns of transient Killer Whales vary throughout the day. Generally, deep dives are more frequent during the day and shallow dives are of longer duration during the night. When traveling, Killer Whales will orient themselves in a line abreast and move in a single direction at a fast pace of up to 20 km/h. Dives may be synchronized. When resting, Killer Whales will also swim in a line abreast but at slower speeds and spaced more tightly together. Vocalization is minimal, and dives will be synchronized and regular, with long dives of 2-5 minutes separated by a series of 3—4 short dives. Resting groups may also be stationary. The Killer Whale is known to be aerially active; breaching, spy hopping, and fluke and flipper slapping are common. Resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean regularly visit kelp beds and shallow pebble beaches, where individuals will intentionally rub their bodies through kelp fronds or along smooth pebbles on the sea floor. This behavior seems to be social and apparently pleasurable.","Populations of Killer Whales known from the West Coast of North America have one of the most stable societies known among non-human mammals. Social structure is matrilineal, with a clearly defined hierarchical organization. The most basic social tier is the matriline, which usually consists of fewer than ten individuals that are all linked by direct maternal descent (a matriarch and up to four generations of her descendants). Matrilines are highly stable, and members are rarely seen separated for more than a few hours. Among resident Killer Whales, there are no documented incidents of individuals permanently dispersing from their natal matrilines. Groups of usually 1-3 related matrilines form the next social tier, the pod. Pods, which among resident Killer Whales may contain 1-55 individuals, are less stable, and their comprising matrilines may separate for weeks or months at a time. Nevertheless, matrilines still tend to travel more often with other matrilines from within their own pod than outside of it. The third social tier is the clan, which consists of pods that all have similar vocal dialects. These dialects are a reflection of maternal ancestry and are considered to be a good example of a non-human cultural tradition (a socially learned behavior that is consistently passed across generations). A clan dialect likely originates from a common ancestral pod, and within-clan pods are more closely related than between-clan pods with different dialects. Offspring learn dialects from their mothers through vocal imitation. Clans are sympatric, however, and mixed-clan aggregations of pods are common. Dialects have also been documented among herring-specialist Killer Whales off northern Norway and likely also exist in other less-studied populations. For example, dialects and matrilineal structure were recently described for a population of Killer Whales in Avacha Gulf, Russia. There are few data on how clans are related to each other and on how they may have originated. The last socialtier is the community, which is defined by pod association patterns, not clan membership (i.e. not maternal ancestry or dialect). Pods may often associate with other pods from different clans, but they rarely associate with other pods from outside their community. There are three communities of resident Killer Whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean: southern residents (three pods, one clan), northern residents (16 pods, three clans), and southern Alaskan residents (eleven pods, two clans). The social structure oftransient Killer Whalesis less understood. Transient Killer Whales also have matrilines, but individuals disperse from them much more frequently and for longer periods of time than individuals in populations of resident Killer Whales. Matrilines of transient Killer Whales thus tend to be smaller (pods often consist ofless than ten individuals), and observing single individuals is more common. Communities of transient Killer Whales do not have group-specific dialects, which is likely due to their less stable social organization not being conducive to the development ofspecific cross-generational learned behaviors. Associations among matrilines of transient Killer Whales are also less consistent than they are for resident Killer Whales, so matrilines do not form identifiable pods. Large-scale social stability is still evident, however, and communities of matrilines of transient Killer Whales are distinguishable by their preferred within-community association. There are three communities of transient Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Although social structure has been less thoroughly studied in other populations of Killer Whales, matrilineal organization is likely typical of the species. There are few documented regular migration patterns, but individuals may move overlarge distances. Resident Killer Whales off the coasts of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, USA, have movements that typically span 630 km. Antarctic and North Atlantic populations of Killer Whales move seasonally with advancing and receding pack ice. Herring-specialist populations migrate between Norwegian and Icelandic waters, following herring schools, and Killer Whales off Patagonia, Argentina, become more abundant during breeding peaks of the Southern Elephant Seal in December and March-May. Some Antarctic populations of Killer Whales may also migrate to lower latitudes seasonally, following migrating Antarctic Minke Whales. Populations of the type B Killer Whale may make periodic “maintenance” migrations into subtropical waters (30-37° S) to allow skin regeneration without as much heat loss. Transient Killer Whales tend to have larger home ranges than resident Killer Whales. For example, groups of transient Killer Whales may travel up to 2600 km between California and Alaska. The maximum known movement of an individual Killer Whale is 5500 km; over a period of years, it was identified in both Baja California and Peru.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The [UCN Red List. Minimum worldwide abundance of the Killer Whale is ¢.50,000 individuals, based on regions that have been surveyed so far, but the total abundance is likely higher. The Data Deficient status will need reevaluation when taxonomy of the Killer Whale changes in the near future. There are ¢.25,000 individuals in Antarctic waters south of 60° S, ¢.119 individuals in New Zealand waters, ¢.30 individuals identified off Argentina, ¢.8500 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific, ¢.1500 individuals in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean (c.251 Aleutian Islands transients, ¢.991 Aleutian Islands residents, c.314 west coast transients, c.211 offshores, ¢.216 northern residents, and c.90 southern residents), ¢.2000 individuals in Japanese waters, ¢.86 individuals off the Baja Peninsula, c.430 individuals in Hawaiian waters, 700-800 individuals in Russian waters, 133 individuals in the northern Gulf of Mexico, 3100 individuals in Norwegian waters, and ¢.6618 individuals in waters off Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Because many populations of Killer Whales are localized and have highly specialized behaviors, they may be especially vulnerable in certain areas. For example, the population near the Strait of Gibraltar is threatened due to low abundance (less than 50 individuals) and declines in bluefin tuna stocks, which are their primary prey. The southern resident Killer Whale community in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean is listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act (USA) and Species at Risk Act (Canada) due to recent population decline. This was driven largely by targeted removals of young females (63 individuals in total) for captive display in 1964-1977. In the past, the Killer Whale was a small-scale target of commercial and subsistence whaling. Soviet whalers took 26 ind/year on average in 1939-1975. Currently, Killer Whales are killed in small numbers in fisheries offJapan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands. The Killer Whale may also be injured or killed on purpose by fishermen to reduce interference with fisheries, and in the past, especially out of fear—a persecution similar to that suffered by sharks and Wolves (Canis lupus). This fear was likely a result of the Killer Whale’s diverse diet, particularly of the mammal-eating specialists, and is reflected in the species’ common name. Norway killed an average of 56 Killer Whales/year in 1938-1981 to deliberately reduce competition with local fisheries, and fishermen in Alaskan waters continue to opportunistically shoot Killer Whales to prevent interference in long-line fisheries. Killer Whales will often follow fishing vessels, sometimes for long periods. In the Bering Sea, for example, a single pod followed a fishing vessel for 31 days covering 1600 km. In waters north of Scotland, Killer Whales approach mackerel fishing boats during net retrieval to feed on escaped catch, butso far, there has been no evidence of accidental entanglement. Reduced prey availability is also a threat to the Killer Whale. For example, recent declines of Chinook salmon stocks in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean due to overfishing and spawning ground degradation are threats to the local communities of resident Killer Whales. Vessel collisions in areas of high traffic, especially from careless whale-watching operations, may also be a problem. The Killer Whale is a particularly charismatic cetacean and an extremely popular whale-watching subject, and increased vesseltraffic in their vicinity may disturb normal activities by reducing resting and foraging. Underwater noise from numerous vessel engines can also mask echolocation and social signals. The Killer Whale is currently one of the most common and iconic features of aquaria, and it is often taken in live captures. This contributed to the depletion of the population of southern resident Killer Whales. In the 1970s and 1980s c.50 individuals were taken from Icelandic populations for captive display, and Killer Whales are still occasionally caught and sold in the captive industry (along with other species of ocean dolphin) during controversial Japanese dolphin drives operating in Taiji. Pollution is another threat to Killer Whales. The Exxon Valdez oil spill contributed to a 33% loss in a pod ofresident Killer Whale and 41% loss in a group of transient Killer Whales. The pod has not recovered, and the group continued to decline and is now depleted. As a top predator, the Killer Whale also suffers from contamination from bioaccumulation of persistent organochlorines. Transient and southern resident killer whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean are, in fact, the most PCB-contaminated marine mammals in the world, although levels have been declining gradually in recent years. Use of PBDEs in flame-retardants, however, has led to recent, rapid increases in concentrations of PBDEs in body tissue of cetaceans, including the Killer Whale. In southern resident Killer Whales, for example, tissue concentrations of PBDEs are predicted to rise in the near future. Populations of Killer Whales in northern Norway have tissue concentrations of PCBs similar to Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean and also have very high levels of PB-DEs. Japanese populations of Killer Whales appear especially contaminated with DDT. Accumulated high concentrations ofthese persistent organochlorine pollutants are known to have immunosuppressive effects and reduce reproductive success.","Baird (2000) | Barrett-Lenard (2000) | Bigg et al.

Dietary preference of offshore Killer Whales is currently poorly known but appears to include more offshore fish species such as Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and various carcharinid sharks. Resident, transient, and offshore killer whales, although partially sympatric in their distributions, do not appearto associate with each other and are unambiguously distinct in mtDNA and nDNA composition. Given their dietary specializations, this genetic divergenceis likely the result of foraging strategies being socially passed across generations. This would have eventually given rise to divergent enough skill-sets so as to underlie mutually exclusive lifestyles, making for an intriguing and rare case where ecological divergence is likely driving incipient sympatric speciation. Populations of Killer Whales that inhabit Norwegian fjords specialize on herring ( Clupea spp. ) and behaviorally resemble resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. The Antarctic type A Killer Whale specializes on the Antarctic Minke Whale (B. bonaerensis), and type B populations in the vicinity of New Zealand may specialize on sharks and other elasmobranchs. The type C Killer Whale feeds primarily on Antarctic fish species, and some populations of type D Killer Whale are thought to prefer Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). In the Canadian Arctic, Killer Whales most commonly prey on the Beluga (Delphinapterusleucas) , the Narwhal ( Monodon monoceros), and the Bowhead Whale (Balaena mysticetus). In multiple populations, dietary specialization has led to development of unique foraging strategies. For example, Norwegian populations of Killer Whales use a strategy called “carousel feeding,” during which a school ofherring is herded into a tight ball near the water’s surface. Individual whales then stun and pick at prey around edges of the ball. Killer Whales in the Strait of Gibraltar feed on Atlantic bluefin tuna ( Thunnus thynnus) by chasing schools for ¢.30 minutes at high speed until tuna are exhausted. Transient Killer Whales usually hunt in small groups and are more acoustically quiet than resident Killer Whales, likely to keep from alerting their mammalian prey. Killing seals and sea lions usually involves repeated ramming, slapping them with flukes, or even leaping on them. After prey is stunned,it is dragged underwater and drowned. The killed animal is then shared among the group. Killer Whales may herd large groups of dolphins or porpoises into confined bays where they can be easily killed after being trapped (a strategy that is disturbingly reminiscent of human dolphin drives). Larger groups of transient Killer Whales are required to successfully attack mysticetes and the Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus). The group will coordinate itself so that some individuals grasp flippers and tail flukes of prey to impede movement while others gash at the blowhole area to impair breathing. Blubber,lips, and tongue are usually the only parts of the killed whale that are consumed. Groups of type B Killer Whale in Antarctica have learned how to coordinate forceful water waves to wash over and tilt ice floes to dislodge Weddell Seals (Leptonychotes weddelliz) resting on them. When this wave-washing technique fails, one or two Killer Whales may even lift the ice floe with their heads to flip it over or break it. Killer Whales off Patagonia, Argentina, have developed a strategy for hunting young Southern Elephant Seals (Mirounga leonina) and South American Sea Lions (Otaria byronia) that involves intentionally stranding themselves temporarily on the sloping beaches. Killer Whales around the Crozet Islands use a similar method, and in this region, there is compelling evidence to suggest that adults actively teach this strategy to their offspring. Breeding. Off the Pacific coast of North America, breeding peaks in October—March but may occur throughout the year. In the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, breeding peaks between late fall and mid-winter. Most life history data are drawn from resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean and may not be typical of all populations of Killer Whales. Mating is endogamous in resident Killer Whales, occurring when males briefly leave their matrilines to mate with females from other pods within the same social clan, usually during on temporary merging of pods (superpod). Clans are culturally distinguished by different vocal dialects that reflect the degree to which pods and matrilines are related and may serve as important communicative cues for avoiding inbreeding. Gestation period of the Killer Whale is one of the longest among mammals, lasting 15-18 months, and the birthing interval lasts c.5 years. Young are weaned at 1-3 years of age and reach sexual maturity at 10-15 years for females and c.15 years for males. Males do not reach full physical maturity until c.21 years. Males may live up to 50-60 years, and females may live up to 80-90 years. Females will give birth to an average of five viable offspring during their lifetimes and become menopausal at c.40 years. The Killer Whale is one of only a handful of mammalian species, including humans, with well-documented, post-reproductive female longevity. As a species with a matrilineal social structure, post-reproductive female longevity may contribute fitness benefits to offspring and grand-offspring via amassed stores of socially transferrable knowledge. Such knowledge could include long-term awareness of prey distribution and movements. Socially derived survival advantages that are dependent on long-term memory stores or experience thus provide evolutionary pressure forfemales to live beyond reproductive age. Activity patterns. Foraging and traveling are the most common behaviorsin all studied populations of Killer Whales. Resident Killer Whales spend a much higher proportion of their time foraging and traveling (90-95%) than do transient Killer Whales (60-70%) that spend more time socializing and resting. Herring-specialist populations of Killer Whales off northern Norway have an activity budget very similar to that of resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean, suggesting that the proportion of time spent traveling and foraging depends heavily on preferred prey type. Resident Killer Whales have seasonal inshore—offshore movements associated with migrating salmon and forage in bouts of 2-3 hours. Pods move in a consistent direction at a mean swimming speed of ¢.6 km/h, with individuals widely spread out. Caught prey may be shared among small subgroups or among mothers and offspring. Resident Killer Whales tend to be vocally quiet while foraging, repeating discrete calls drawn from an average repertoire of twelve call types per pod. Diving patterns of transient Killer Whales vary throughout the day. Generally, deep dives are more frequent during the day and shallow dives are of longer duration during the night. When traveling, Killer Whales will orient themselves in a line abreast and move in a single direction at a fast pace of up to 20 km/h. Dives may be synchronized. When resting, Killer Whales will also swim in a line abreast but at slower speeds and spaced more tightly together. Vocalization is minimal, and dives will be synchronized and regular, with long dives of 2-5 minutes separated by a series of 3—4 short dives. Resting groups may also be stationary. The Killer Whale is known to be aerially active; breaching, spy hopping, and fluke and flipper slapping are common. Resident Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean regularly visit kelp beds and shallow pebble beaches, where individuals will intentionally rub their bodies through kelp fronds or along smooth pebbles on the sea floor. This behavior seems to be social and apparently pleasurable. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Populations of Killer Whales known from the West Coast of North America have one of the most stable societies known among non-human mammals. Social structure is matrilineal, with a clearly defined hierarchical organization. The most basic social tier is the matriline, which usually consists of fewer than ten individuals that are all linked by direct maternal descent (a matriarch and up to four generations of her descendants). Matrilines are highly stable, and members are rarely seen separated for more than a few hours. Among resident Killer Whales, there are no documented incidents of individuals permanently dispersing from their natal matrilines. Groups of usually 1-3 related matrilines form the next social tier, the pod. Pods, which among resident Killer Whales may contain 1-55 individuals, are less stable, and their comprising matrilines may separate for weeks or months at a time. Nevertheless, matrilines still tend to travel more often with other matrilines from within their own pod than outside of it. The third social tier is the clan, which consists of pods that all have similar vocal dialects. These dialects are a reflection of maternal ancestry and are considered to be a good example of a non-human cultural tradition (a socially learned behavior that is consistently passed across generations). A clan dialect likely originates from a common ancestral pod, and within-clan pods are more closely related than between-clan pods with different dialects. Offspring learn dialects from their mothers through vocal imitation. Clans are sympatric, however, and mixed-clan aggregations of pods are common. Dialects have also been documented among herring-specialist Killer Whales off northern Norway and likely also exist in other less-studied populations. For example, dialects and matrilineal structure were recently described for a population of Killer Whales in Avacha Gulf, Russia. There are few data on how clans are related to each other and on how they may have originated. The last socialtier is the community, which is defined by pod association patterns, not clan membership (i.e. not maternal ancestry or dialect). Pods may often associate with other pods from different clans, but they rarely associate with other pods from outside their community. There are three communities of resident Killer Whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean: southern residents (three pods, one clan), northern residents (16 pods, three clans), and southern Alaskan residents (eleven pods, two clans). The social structure oftransient Killer Whalesis less understood. Transient Killer Whales also have matrilines, but individuals disperse from them much more frequently and for longer periods of time than individuals in populations of resident Killer Whales. Matrilines of transient Killer Whales thus tend to be smaller (pods often consist ofless than ten individuals), and observing single individuals is more common. Communities of transient Killer Whales do not have group-specific dialects, which is likely due to their less stable social organization not being conducive to the development ofspecific cross-generational learned behaviors. Associations among matrilines of transient Killer Whales are also less consistent than they are for resident Killer Whales, so matrilines do not form identifiable pods. Large-scale social stability is still evident, however, and communities of matrilines of transient Killer Whales are distinguishable by their preferred within-community association. There are three communities of transient Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean. Although social structure has been less thoroughly studied in other populations of Killer Whales, matrilineal organization is likely typical of the species. There are few documented regular migration patterns, but individuals may move overlarge distances. Resident Killer Whales off the coasts of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, USA, have movements that typically span 630 km. Antarctic and North Atlantic populations of Killer Whales move seasonally with advancing and receding pack ice. Herring-specialist populations migrate between Norwegian and Icelandic waters, following herring schools, and Killer Whales off Patagonia, Argentina, become more abundant during breeding peaks of the Southern Elephant Seal in December and March-May. Some Antarctic populations of Killer Whales may also migrate to lower latitudes seasonally, following migrating Antarctic Minke Whales. Populations of the type B Killer Whale may make periodic “maintenance” migrations into subtropical waters (30-37° S) to allow skin regeneration without as much heat loss. Transient Killer Whales tend to have larger home ranges than resident Killer Whales. For example, groups of transient Killer Whales may travel up to 2600 km between California and Alaska. The maximum known movement of an individual Killer Whale is 5500 km; over a period of years, it was identified in both Baja California and Peru. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The [UCN Red List. Minimum worldwide abundance of the Killer Whale is ¢.50,000 individuals, based on regions that have been surveyed so far, but the total abundance is likely higher. The Data Deficient status will need reevaluation when taxonomy of the Killer Whale changes in the near future. There are ¢.25,000 individuals in Antarctic waters south of 60° S, ¢.119 individuals in New Zealand waters, ¢.30 individuals identified off Argentina, ¢.8500 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific, ¢.1500 individuals in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean (c.251 Aleutian Islands transients, ¢.991 Aleutian Islands residents, c.314 west coast transients, c.211 offshores, ¢.216 northern residents, and c.90 southern residents), ¢.2000 individuals in Japanese waters, ¢.86 individuals off the Baja Peninsula, c.430 individuals in Hawaiian waters, 700-800 individuals in Russian waters, 133 individuals in the northern Gulf of Mexico, 3100 individuals in Norwegian waters, and ¢.6618 individuals in waters off Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Because many populations of Killer Whales are localized and have highly specialized behaviors, they may be especially vulnerable in certain areas. For example, the population near the Strait of Gibraltar is threatened due to low abundance (less than 50 individuals) and declines in bluefin tuna stocks, which are their primary prey. The southern resident Killer Whale community in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean is listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act (USA) and Species at Risk Act (Canada) due to recent population decline. This was driven largely by targeted removals of young females (63 individuals in total) for captive display in 1964-1977. In the past, the Killer Whale was a small-scale target of commercial and subsistence whaling. Soviet whalers took 26 ind/year on average in 1939-1975. Currently, Killer Whales are killed in small numbers in fisheries offJapan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands. The Killer Whale may also be injured or killed on purpose by fishermen to reduce interference with fisheries, and in the past, especially out of fear—a persecution similar to that suffered by sharks and Wolves (Canis lupus). This fear was likely a result of the Killer Whale’s diverse diet, particularly of the mammal-eating specialists, and is reflected in the species’ common name. Norway killed an average of 56 Killer Whales/year in 1938-1981 to deliberately reduce competition with local fisheries, and fishermen in Alaskan waters continue to opportunistically shoot Killer Whales to prevent interference in long-line fisheries. Killer Whales will often follow fishing vessels, sometimes for long periods. In the Bering Sea, for example, a single pod followed a fishing vessel for 31 days covering 1600 km. In waters north of Scotland, Killer Whales approach mackerel fishing boats during net retrieval to feed on escaped catch, butso far, there has been no evidence of accidental entanglement. Reduced prey availability is also a threat to the Killer Whale. For example, recent declines of Chinook salmon stocks in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean due to overfishing and spawning ground degradation are threats to the local communities of resident Killer Whales. Vessel collisions in areas of high traffic, especially from careless whale-watching operations, may also be a problem. The Killer Whale is a particularly charismatic cetacean and an extremely popular whale-watching subject, and increased vesseltraffic in their vicinity may disturb normal activities by reducing resting and foraging. Underwater noise from numerous vessel engines can also mask echolocation and social signals. The Killer Whale is currently one of the most common and iconic features of aquaria, and it is often taken in live captures. This contributed to the depletion of the population of southern resident Killer Whales. In the 1970s and 1980s c.50 individuals were taken from Icelandic populations for captive display, and Killer Whales are still occasionally caught and sold in the captive industry (along with other species of ocean dolphin) during controversial Japanese dolphin drives operating in Taiji. Pollution is another threat to Killer Whales. The Exxon Valdez oil spill contributed to a 33% loss in a pod ofresident Killer Whale and 41% loss in a group of transient Killer Whales. The pod has not recovered, and the group continued to decline and is now depleted. As a top predator, the Killer Whale also suffers from contamination from bioaccumulation of persistent organochlorines. Transient and southern resident killer whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean are, in fact, the most PCB-contaminated marine mammals in the world, although levels have been declining gradually in recent years. Use of PBDEs in flame-retardants, however, has led to recent, rapid increases in concentrations of PBDEs in body tissue of cetaceans, including the Killer Whale. In southern resident Killer Whales, for example, tissue concentrations of PBDEs are predicted to rise in the near future. Populations of Killer Whales in northern Norway have tissue concentrations of PCBs similar to Killer Whales in the north-eastern Pacific Ocean and also have very high levels of PB-DEs. Japanese populations of Killer Whales appear especially contaminated with DDT. Accumulated high concentrations ofthese persistent organochlorine pollutants are known to have immunosuppressive effects and reduce reproductive success. Bibliography.

Flippers are large and wide, 7-3% of total body length on average, with rounded tips. Shallow groove also runs from neck to dorsal fin along back, a feature that distinguishes the Irrawaddy Dolphin from the closely related Australian Snubfin Dolphin ( O. heinsohni ). Skin pigmentation ranges from uniform dark gray along most of dorsal surface to paler gray on ventral areas. There are 8-19 pairs of teeth in upper jaw and 11-18 pairs in lower jaw, although teeth may not erupt in some populations.","Five distinct populations in freshwater: the Irrawaddy (up to 1500 km upstream), Mekong (up to 690 km upstream), and Mahakam (up to 560 km upstream) river systems; Malampaya Sound in the Philippines; and the brackish Songkhla Lake in Thailand. These populations of Irrawaddy Dolphins are demographically isolated from marine populations and prefer shallow coastal, estuarine, and fresh turbid waters. All sightings of non-freshwater individuals have been within a few kilometers of coastlines. In the Mekong River system, the Irrawaddy Dolphin occurs most often near sand banks and stream tributaries and is confined to pool river sections that are at least 8 m deep during the dry season. Populations that inhabit nearshore waters off Bangladesh appear to prefer shallow depths and low salinity, which likely reflects distributions of preferred prey.","The Irrawaddy Dolphin is a generalist and primarily diurnal feeder, preying on a wide variety small fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans that are abundant in near-shore marine and freshwater environments. Echolocation clicks are emitted in short pulses of 25-30 psec at a frequency of ¢.60 kHz. Individuals from freshwater populations can spit water while foraging as a kind of herding strategy. In upper reaches of the Irrawaddy River system, the Irrawaddy Dolphin has established a cooperative fishery with local cast-net fishermen. One or two dolphins will herd a school offish toward shore and wave their flukes to surge the school toward waiting fishermen, who then cast their nets over the mass. Fish that are confused by the net’s movement or trapped under the lead line become easy prey for the Irrawaddy Dolphins. Fishermen that cooperate with the dolphins have a much lower zero-catch frequency.","Breeding of Irrawaddy Dolphins may occur throughout the year, but it peaks during the pre-monsoon season in April-June. Gestation is c.14 months, and longevity is ¢.30 years, although thereis likely great variation among populations.","In the Mekong River, the Irrawaddy Dolphin is most active in the morning while foraging. Dives are generally less than three minutes long but can last up to twelve minutes. Surfacing behavior of Irrawaddy Dolphins is mostly cryptic unless they are disturbed, socializing, or swimming against strong currents. Dives are slow and rolling, often with only a small part of the dorsal area becoming visible above the water's surface. Irrawaddy Dolphins spy-hop and breach occasionally, but they are not known to bow-ride.","Group sizes of Irrawaddy Dolphins are generally 2-6 individuals, but groups of up to 25 individuals have been documented aggregating in deep pool sections of the Mekong River during the dry season. Daily linear ranges in the Mahakam River average 10-61 km over the long-term (3:5 years). Seasonal movements that coincide with seasonalshifts in freshwater input are observed in populations inhabiting the Sundarbans mangrove forest in Bangladesh. Irrawaddy Dolphins follow the salinity gradient, probably to keep up with movements of prey species. In the Mahakam River system, the Irrawaddy Dolphin migrates daily between the river proper and the Semayang Lake, sometimes swimming up to 1300 km upstream. During the high-water season, they spend more time in tributaries.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The five freshwater subpopulations (Irrawaddy, Mahakam, and Mekong rivers; Melampaya Sound; and Songkhla Lake) of the Irrawaddy Dolphin are listed separately as Critically Endangered. Population sizes are generally low, ranging from the tens to low hundreds. In recent years, the Irrawaddy Dolphin has decreased in abundance, there have been reductions in its distribution, and incidental catch and habitat degradation are extensive. As such, a 30% reduction in its abundance is likely over the next three generations (45-48 years). Total abundance and trend estimates for the Irrawaddy Dolphin are currently unavailable, and only a few locations in its distribution have been assessed. There are 77 individuals in Malampaya Sound, 127 individuals in the Mekong River, 70 individuals in the Mahakam River, 58-72 individuals in the Irrawaddy River, 62-98 individuals in Chilika Lake, fewer than 50 mature individuals in Songkhla Lake, 5383 individuals in coastal waters of Bangladesh, and 451 individuals in mangrove forests of Bangladesh (Sundarbans). Because it has a limited distribution and inhabits environments close to shore, the Irrawaddy Dolphin is especially vulnerable to threats from human activities. The most serious are incidental catch and habitat degradation. Irrawaddy Dolphins have been caught incidentally in fisheries throughout most of their distribution. Between 2001 and 2005, 13 deaths occurred from gillnet entanglement in the Mekong River, and between 1995 and 2005, 32 similar deaths occurred in the Mahakam River. The Irrawaddy Dolphin also has died incidentally in elasmobranch fisheries off Bangladesh and in crab fisheries in Malampaya Sound. In the Irrawaddy River, fishing with electricity poses a severe threat to the small population of Irrawaddy Dolphins living there. Between 2001 and 2005, 29 individuals died in incidental catches in Malampaya Sound, and the population is expected to go extinct within seven years if fishing continues unmitigated. Damming of the Mekong River threatens the population there by blocking movements along the river and disrupting availability of deep pool habitats, which are vital to Irrawaddy Dolphins during the dry season. Upstream water withdrawals in Bangladesh are causing increased sedimentation in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, which is gradually reducing water depth and channel accessibility for resident Irrawaddy Dolphins. Deforestation is causing similar problems in the Songkhla, Chilika, and Semayang lakes. For example, between 1992 and 1997, Chilika Lake’s maximum depth was reduced from 3-4 m to 1-4 m, which caused a decrease in salinity and shrinking of its entrance channel. Songkhla Lake has 40,000 fixed fishing nets that create more than 8000 km of linear barriers along the river system. As such, movements of Irrawaddy Dolphins are severely restricted; some parts of the habitat are inaccessible. Fixed fishing nets in the Semayang Lake also restrict access into the Mekong River by a narrow, dredged channel subject to intense vessel traffic. The Irrawaddy Dolphin, which is rather charismatic in appearance and behavior,is also taken for captive display in aquaria. Because international trade in live Irrawaddy Dolphins is a possibility, it is included on CITES Appendix I. The Irrawaddy Dolphin is legally protected from direct catch in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Laos, Malaysia, Burma (= Myanmar), Thailand, and Vietnam, but there are no monitoring programs currently in effect for incidental catch. Habitats of Irrawaddy Dolphins have only been minimally protected so far. Parts of the Sundarbans Delta are included in Protected Forests and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but there are no conservation initiatives in the area specifically for Irrawaddy Dolphins. Eight protected areas totaling 5721 ha and 190 km of the Mekong River have been drafted for protection by the Cambodian Department of Fisheries, and a 74km segment of the Irrawaddy River has been announced as a protected area by the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries of Myanmar. In these areas, the Irrawaddy Dolphin may not be deliberately caught, electrofishing is prohibited, and nets are not allowed to obstruct the river course or be more than 100 m long or spaced less than 200 m apart. Fishermen are also obligated to release Irrawaddy Dolphins that are found entangled alive in fishing nets. Other proposed strategies for conserving the Irrawaddy Dolphin, especially the Critically Endangered freshwater populations, include subsidization of fishermen to reduce incidental catch, no-fishing zones for areas ofcritical habitat, establishment of long-term population monitoring programs, and promotion of the Irrawaddy Dolphin as a “poster species” for ecosystem-based conservation initiatives.","Baird & Beasley (2005) | Beasley et al.

L. obscurus may form a sister lineage with L. obliquidens to Cephalorhynchus . The two species may be classified into this or another genus ( Sagmatias ) in the near future. Two subspecies have been recognized based on patchy discontinuous distributions, but more recent genetic evidence suggests that L. o. fitzroyi from South America consists of two separate stocks. The population of L. o. fitzroyi off northern Chile and Peru (the “Peruvian/Chilean Dusky Dolphin”) is likely distinct from the Patagonian population, and it was assigned to a separate subspecies, posidonia, named by Philippi in 1893, but not recognized here. A still undescribed form (the “New Zealand Dusky Dolphin”) is present in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Two subspecies are recognized.","L.o.obscurusGray,1828—coastalwatersofSAfrica(Namibia,SouthAfrica),PrinceEdwardandAmsterdamIs. L. o. fitzroyi Waterhouse, 1838 — coastal waters of S South America as far N as Peru in the Pacific Ocean and N Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean. Dusky Dolphins of a still undescribed form (New Zealand Dusky Dolphins) are present near New Zealand, Campbell, Auckland, and Chatham Is, and an uncertain subspecies has also been observed infrequently off the Falkland Is, Gough I, S Australia, and Tasmania.","Total length up to 210 cm; weight 70-85 kg. Neonates are 80-100 cm long and weigh 9-6 kg. Dusky Dolphins are not sexually dimorphic in size. They have robust body shape, short well-defined beak, and falcate dorsal fin with a pointed tip positioned slightly behind mid-body. Flippers are small and curved with rounded tips. Skin is dark gray to black dorsally; it fades into white on belly and throat. There are large pale-gray patches on lower anterior flanks that extend onto most of face. Most of beak and lips are dark gray. Wide, pale-gray streak, also on lower posterior flanks, extends from tailstock and tapers into a point at mid-body just in front of dorsal fin. Thinner streak often branches off from dorsal margin behind dorsal fin and extends along upper flanks and onto back, sometimes as far as blowhole. There is also dark-gray ring around each eye. Flippers are pale gray and fade into dark gray around edges. Dorsal fin may also have a faint pale-gray patch on its posterior one-half. Some individuals in populations of “Fitzroy’s Dusky Dolphin” (L. o. fitzroyi) are larger in size than individuals in populations of the African Dusky Dolphin (L. o. obscurus ). There are 27-36 pairs of small, conical teeth in each jaw.","Coastal species, most abundant over continental slopes. The Dusky Dolphin prefers deep (up to 2000 m), cool waters of 10-18°C. They are associated with the cool Benguela Current off South Africa and the cool Humboldt Current off South America.","The Dusky Dolphin is an opportunistic feeder whose diet varies according to geographic region and prey availability throughout the year. They feed on a variety offish species throughout the water column, including Argentine anchovy ( Engraulis anchoita), hake ( Merluccius spp. ), and lanternfish ( Myctophidae ). Off Peru, Peruvian anchoveta (E. ringens) is their most common prey, but they will feed on other species when anchoveta are not abundant. Some populations of Dusky Dolphins also feed on squid, so they forage nocturnally in association with the rise of the deep scattering layer. Common squid prey species include Patagonian squid ( Doryteuthis gahi) and jumbo flying squid ( Dosidicus gigas). Off New Zealand, there are seasonal changes in prey preferences. In May-July, Dusky Dolphins feed on more pelagic species, but in August=November, they focus on small schooling surface fish. Dusky Dolphins may forage cooperatively. Large groups off Argentina herd schools of anchovy into tight balls near the surface for easier capture; larger groups are more successful at this herding technique than smaller groups.","Breeding of the Dusky Dolphin peaks in August-October off Peru and New Zealand, but elsewhere in November—February, during the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. Both sexes mature at 4-6 years. Gestation lasts c.13 months, and young individuals are weaned after about one year. Breeding females give birth to a single offspring every 1-2 years. Male testes size is known to increase during the breeding season, so given the lack of observed male-male aggression and sexual dimorphism, the mating system of the Dusky Dolphin is likely promiscuous and dependent on sperm competition. There is some evidence for limited male dispersal among groups in coastal populations. Longevity is thought to be 35-36 years.","The Dusky Dolphin is a very acrobatic species known for high leaps and bow riding. They are generally approachable and curious about boats. Most dives appear to be short, averaging c.21 seconds, but foraging dives may be longer (more than 90 seconds). Foraging dives are also generally shallow but may be up to 130 m. Off Kaikoura, New Zealand, resting behavior is most common in the middle of the day, foraging takes place primarily at night, and socializing occurs in the morning and afternoon, especially after feeding, when socio-sexual activity is common. Dusky Dolphins tend to move into more near-shore waters for resting. The Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ) is a known predator of the Dusky Dolphin, and moving into very shallow near-shore waters may be a strategy to avoid predation. Groups with young offspring also are observed more commonly in near-shore waters, again likely for safety. Dusky Dolphin echolocation clicks have a bimodal frequency spectrum (40-50 kHz and 80-100 kHz) similar to other delphinids.","The Dusky Dolphin is a gregarious species. Most groups consist of 20-500 individuals, but groups of more than 1000 individuals have been observed. Smaller groups (under 20 individuals) are more common during winter. Associations are mostly fluid, but there may be some stable subgroup structure. Groups of Dusky Dolphins off New Zealand tend to be more closely knit than elsewhere where subgroups are more spaced out within a group. Subgroups in most populations will separate during resting behavior. The Dusky Dolphin is often seen in association with the Long-beaked Common Dolphin ( Delphinus capensis ) and various seabirds (cormorants, boobies, and pelicans) in feeding aggregations. They also will travel with Short-beaked Common Dolphins (Delphinusdelphis) oft New Zealand and Southern Right-whale Dolphins ( Lissodelphis peronii ) oft Namibia. The latter association may result in occasional hybridization. Off Kaikoura, nursery groups consist mostly of mother—offspring pairs, with young all about the same age. These groups are found most often in near-shore shallow waters less than 20 m deep to avoid predation by sharks and Killer Whales. There are known seasonal inshore—offshore movements in some areas, such as off Argentina and New Zealand. For example, the Dusky Dolphin is known to move from Kaikoura into the Marlborough Sounds (¢.200 km) to feed during winter. They can also move long distances; the longest known linear distance traveled by the Dusky Dolphin is 780 km.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. There is limited abundance data currently available for the Dusky Dolphin, and Fitzroy’s Dusky Dolphin has not been assessed independently. Off Patagonia, there are ¢.7252 individuals and off Argentina, c.6628 individuals. Nevertheless, the Dusky Dolphin is one of the most abundant small cetaceans on the Patagonian Shelf and off coastal Peru. It is currently not known if oceanic island populations are isolated. Without abundance, trend, or population structure data, the risk status of the Dusky Dolphin cannot be adequately assessed. Off Peru, until the 1990s, there used to be extensive small cetacean fisheries, and in 1991-1993, ¢.7000 Dusky Dolphins were killed annually—an unsustainable catch rate. Dolphin hunting was banned in Peru in 1996, and this, in combination with population depletion, has likely contributed to a diminished catch rate. Some are still caught for use as bait in long-line and gillnet fisheries due to a lack of law enforcement; current catch rates unknown. The Dusky Dolphin is susceptible to incidental catch in Patagonian trawl fisheries. In the 1980s, 400-600 dolphins were killed per year, mostly females. This catch rate declined in the 1990s, but several hundred Dusky Dolphins are still killed yearly off southern Argentina. This may have had a severe effect on the population. In New Zealand, there has been some incidental entanglement in recreational gillnets, but catch rates have diminished since the 1980s. Offshore aquaculture may be a growing problem in Marlborough Sound. Dolphin watching and swimming have also become a major tourist industry since late 1980s in New Zealand. Harmful effects on Dusky Dolphins do not appear to be substantial, but over the long term, they have exhibited less resting behavior in the vicinity of tourism vessels, which suggests a lowered tolerance to vessel traffic.

Dusky Dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus French: Dauphin obscur / German: Dunkler Delfin / Spanish: Delfin de Fitzroy Other common names: Beakless Dolphin; African Dusky Dolphin (obscurus); Fitzroy's Dolphin , South American Dusky Dolphin (fitzroyi); Chilean Dusky Dolphin , Peruvian Dusky Dolphin (Peru and northern Chile population); New Zealand Dusky Dolphin (New Zealand population) Taxonomy. Delphinus obscurus Gray, 1828, “Inhab. Cape of Good Hope,” Western Cape Province, South Africa. Taxonomy of Lagenorhynchus is currently in dispute; recent molecular analyses have revealed that the genus is not monophyletic. L. obscurus may form a sister lineage with L. obliquidens to Cephalorhynchus . The two species may be classified into this or another genus ( Sagmatias ) in the near future. Two subspecies have been recognized based on patchy discontinuous distributions, but more recent genetic evidence suggests that L. o. fitzroyi from South America consists of two separate stocks. The population of L. o. fitzroyi off northern Chile and Peru (the “Peruvian/Chilean Dusky Dolphin”) is likely distinct from the Patagonian population, and it was assigned to a separate subspecies, posidonia, named by Philippi in 1893, but not recognized here. A still undescribed form (the “New Zealand Dusky Dolphin”) is present in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Two subspecies are recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. L.o.obscurusGray,1828—coastalwatersofSAfrica(Namibia,SouthAfrica),PrinceEdwardandAmsterdamIs. L. o. fitzroyi Waterhouse, 1838 — coastal waters of S South America as far N as Peru in the Pacific Ocean and N Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean. Dusky Dolphins of a still undescribed form (New Zealand Dusky Dolphins) are present near New Zealand, Campbell, Auckland, and Chatham Is, and an uncertain subspecies has also been observed infrequently off the Falkland Is, Gough I, S Australia, and Tasmania. Descriptive notes. Total length up to 210 cm; weight 70-85 kg. Neonates are 80-100 cm long and weigh 9-6 kg. Dusky Dolphins are not sexually dimorphic in size. They have robust body shape, short well-defined beak, and falcate dorsal fin with a pointed tip positioned slightly behind mid-body. Flippers are small and curved with rounded tips. Skin is dark gray to black dorsally; it fades into white on belly and throat. There are large pale-gray patches on lower anterior flanks that extend onto most of face. Most of beak and lips are dark gray. Wide, pale-gray streak, also on lower posterior flanks, extends from tailstock and tapers into a point at mid-body just in front of dorsal fin. Thinner streak often branches off from dorsal margin behind dorsal fin and extends along upper flanks and onto back, sometimes as far as blowhole. There is also dark-gray ring around each eye. Flippers are pale gray and fade into dark gray around edges. Dorsal fin may also have a faint pale-gray patch on its posterior one-half. Some individuals in populations of “Fitzroy’s Dusky Dolphin” (L. o. fitzroyi) are larger in size than individuals in populations of the African Dusky Dolphin (L. o. obscurus ). There are 27-36 pairs of small, conical teeth in each jaw. Habitat. Coastal species, most abundant over continental slopes. The Dusky Dolphin prefers deep (up to 2000 m), cool waters of 10-18°C. They are associated with the cool Benguela Current off South Africa and the cool Humboldt Current off South America. Food and Feeding. The Dusky Dolphin is an opportunistic feeder whose diet varies according to geographic region and prey availability throughout the year. They feed on a variety offish species throughout the water column, including Argentine anchovy ( Engraulis anchoita), hake ( Merluccius spp. ), and lanternfish ( Myctophidae ). Off Peru, Peruvian anchoveta (E. ringens) is their most common prey, but they will feed on other species when anchoveta are not abundant. Some populations of Dusky Dolphins also feed on squid, so they forage nocturnally in association with the rise of the deep scattering layer. Common squid prey species include Patagonian squid ( Doryteuthis gahi) and jumbo flying squid ( Dosidicus gigas). Off New Zealand, there are seasonal changes in prey preferences. In May-July, Dusky Dolphins feed on more pelagic species, but in August=November, they focus on small schooling surface fish. Dusky Dolphins may forage cooperatively. Large groups off Argentina herd schools of anchovy into tight balls near the surface for easier capture; larger groups are more successful at this herding technique than smaller groups. Breeding. Breeding of the Dusky Dolphin peaks in August-October off Peru and New Zealand, but elsewhere in November—February, during the Southern Hemisphere’s summer. Both sexes mature at 4-6 years. Gestation lasts c.13 months, and young individuals are weaned after about one year. Breeding females give birth to a single offspring every 1-2 years. Male testes size is known to increase during the breeding season, so given the lack of observed male-male aggression and sexual dimorphism, the mating system of the Dusky Dolphin is likely promiscuous and dependent on sperm competition. There is some evidence for limited male dispersal among groups in coastal populations. Longevity is thought to be 35-36 years. Activity patterns. The Dusky Dolphin is a very acrobatic species known for high leaps and bow riding. They are generally approachable and curious about boats. Most dives appear to be short, averaging c.21 seconds, but foraging dives may be longer (more than 90 seconds). Foraging dives are also generally shallow but may be up to 130 m. Off Kaikoura, New Zealand, resting behavior is most common in the middle of the day, foraging takes place primarily at night, and socializing occurs in the morning and afternoon, especially after feeding, when socio-sexual activity is common. Dusky Dolphins tend to move into more near-shore waters for resting. The Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ) is a known predator of the Dusky Dolphin, and moving into very shallow near-shore waters may be a strategy to avoid predation. Groups with young offspring also are observed more commonly in near-shore waters, again likely for safety. Dusky Dolphin echolocation clicks have a bimodal frequency spectrum (40-50 kHz and 80-100 kHz) similar to other delphinids. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Dusky Dolphin is a gregarious species. Most groups consist of 20-500 individuals, but groups of more than 1000 individuals have been observed. Smaller groups (under 20 individuals) are more common during winter. Associations are mostly fluid, but there may be some stable subgroup structure. Groups of Dusky Dolphins off New Zealand tend to be more closely knit than elsewhere where subgroups are more spaced out within a group. Subgroups in most populations will separate during resting behavior. The Dusky Dolphin is often seen in association with the Long-beaked Common Dolphin ( Delphinus capensis ) and various seabirds (cormorants, boobies, and pelicans) in feeding aggregations. They also will travel with Short-beaked Common Dolphins (Delphinusdelphis) oft New Zealand and Southern Right-whale Dolphins ( Lissodelphis peronii ) oft Namibia. The latter association may result in occasional hybridization. Off Kaikoura, nursery groups consist mostly of mother—offspring pairs, with young all about the same age. These groups are found most often in near-shore shallow waters less than 20 m deep to avoid predation by sharks and Killer Whales. There are known seasonal inshore—offshore movements in some areas, such as off Argentina and New Zealand. For example, the Dusky Dolphin is known to move from Kaikoura into the Marlborough Sounds (¢.200 km) to feed during winter. They can also move long distances; the longest known linear distance traveled by the Dusky Dolphin is 780 km. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. There is limited abundance data currently available for the Dusky Dolphin, and Fitzroy’s Dusky Dolphin has not been assessed independently. Off Patagonia, there are ¢.7252 individuals and off Argentina, c.6628 individuals. Nevertheless, the Dusky Dolphin is one of the most abundant small cetaceans on the Patagonian Shelf and off coastal Peru. It is currently not known if oceanic island populations are isolated. Without abundance, trend, or population structure data, the risk status of the Dusky Dolphin cannot be adequately assessed. Off Peru, until the 1990s, there used to be extensive small cetacean fisheries, and in 1991-1993, ¢.7000 Dusky Dolphins were killed annually—an unsustainable catch rate. Dolphin hunting was banned in Peru in 1996, and this, in combination with population depletion, has likely contributed to a diminished catch rate. Some are still caught for use as bait in long-line and gillnet fisheries due to a lack of law enforcement; current catch rates unknown. The Dusky Dolphin is susceptible to incidental catch in Patagonian trawl fisheries. In the 1980s, 400-600 dolphins were killed per year, mostly females. This catch rate declined in the 1990s, but several hundred Dusky Dolphins are still killed yearly off southern Argentina. This may have had a severe effect on the population. In New Zealand, there has been some incidental entanglement in recreational gillnets, but catch rates have diminished since the 1980s. Offshore aquaculture may be a growing problem in Marlborough Sound. Dolphin watching and swimming have also become a major tourist industry since late 1980s in New Zealand. Harmful effects on Dusky Dolphins do not appear to be substantial, but over the long term, they have exhibited less resting behavior in the vicinity of tourism vessels, which suggests a lowered tolerance to vessel traffic. In other species, such as bottlenose dolphins (7 Tursiops spp. ), chronic exposure to disturbance is related to habitat displacement, increased levels of stress hormones, and reduced reproductive success, so there is the potential for a chronic impact to Dusky Dolphins. Some tour companies have voluntarily refrained from offering tours during midday when Dusky Dolphins rest; this restriction became mandatory in 2010. Tourism is also increasing off Patagonia, Argentina. Bibliography. Alonso et al. (1998), Brownell & Cipriano (1999), Cassens et al. (2005), Coscarella et al. ((2003), Dans et al. (1997), Gill et al.

Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. There are currently no concrete estimates of abundance of the Pacific White-sided Dolphin, but 900,000-1,000,000 individuals are estimated in the North Pacific Ocean—perhaps an overestimation biased by attraction to the survey vessel. Off the western USA, abundance is 10,000-41,000 individuals, depending on season and average annual sea-surface temperatures. Population trends are also currently unknown. There is some opportunistic direct catch of the Pacific White-sided Dolphin in Japanese harpoon and drive fisheries, but numbers killed are uncertain. The Pacific White-sided Dolphin is vulnerable to pelagic driftnet fisheries; an estimated 424 individuals were caught incidentally in shark and swordfish fisheries in 1988-2002. Some dolphins are also caught in trammel nets and set nets in coastal California and gillnets off British Columbia and Alaska, but these catches are thought to be below precautionary limits. Incidental catch rate in the US eastern Pacific Ocean is estimated to be very low, only c.1-4 Pacific White-sided Dolphins/year. There are similar estimates for catch rates in near-shore western US waters. In the eastern North Pacific Ocean,fisheries have been required to use “pingers” since 1996 to reduce incidental catch. The Pacific White-sided Dolphin is taken commonly in pelagic squid driftnet fisheries from Japan, Korea, and Taiwan; catch rate for the Japanese squid driftnet fishery was ¢.6100 individuals in 1989. In 1993, the United Nations put a moratorium on high-seas driftnet fisheries, which reduced their impact on the Pacific White-sided Dolphin. Incidental catch in high-seas driftnets was formerly the greatest threat to the Pacific White-sided Dolphin. In the 1970s and 1980s, ¢.100,000 individuals (4000-8000/year) were likely killed in these fisheries, which caused some population depletions in the North Pacific Ocean. A smaller number of Pacific White-sided Dolphins continue to be taken yearly by Japanese seine, set net, and trap net fisheries. Molecular monitoring at markets in South Korea has identified meat of the Pacific Whitesided Dolphin for sale, suggesting opportunistic marketing of incidental catch (given that South Korea has no commercial or scientific whaling programs).

Total length 160-190 cm (males) and 140-180 cm (females); weight up to 94 kg (males) and up to 88 kg (females). Neonates are ¢.100 cm long. The Hourglass Dolphin has robust body shape with short but well-defined beak. Dorsal fin is medium-sized and characteristically hooked in shape. In some individuals, mostly adult males, dorsal fin’s leading edge is bent backward. Males also have more keeled tailstock. Back and flanks are black, and belly and throat are white. Flanks are marked by wide white streaks that extend from base of flukes, arch over upper onehalf of body, and descend along sides of head to mouth in front of eyes, converging with white lower jaw and throat. Flank streaks taper into a thin white line mid-body just below dorsal fin, creating characteristic hourglass shape. Just in front of urogenital area, white belly pigmentation intrudesslightly into black pigmentation of lower lateral tailstock in the shape of a small hook. Dorsal fin, flippers, and flukes are black on both sides. Immature individuals have less pronounced hooks in dorsal fins and have more muted color pattern.

Neonates are 110-120 cm long and weigh c.25 kg. Like the White-beaked Dolphin ( L. albirostris ), the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin has robust body shape and short beak. Dorsal fin, positioned just posterior to halfway on back,is tall (more than 12% of total body length), falcate, and pointed. Flippers are broad, pointed at tips, and covered in tubercles along leading edges. Tailstock is also characteristically deep. The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin has a complicated color pattern. Dorsal surface, including upper jaw, top of head, dorsal fin, and flukes are a dark gray to black, but lower jaw, throat, lower anterior flanks, and belly up to urogenital area are white. Lateral body in between these dorsal and ventral areas and ventral tail posterior to urogenital area are typically medium-todark gray. Thin, dark bands stretch between dark edges of upper jaws to small, dark patches around eyes and from eyes down to anterior bases of flippers. There is a white streak at lateral dark-gray/medium-gray borderstretching from leading edge of dorsal fin to midway along tailstock, and yellow-orange streak at lower margin of lateral dark-gray section stretching from midway along tailstock to base of flukes. Male Atlantic White-sided Dolphins tend to have deeper tailstocks than females, and immature individuals have more muted coloration. There are 30-40 small, conical teeth in each jaw.","Cold temperate and subarctic waters, 100-300 m deep, over outer continental shelves. Nevertheless, Atlantic White-sided Dolphins may enter fjords and inlets less than 50 m deep. They prefer sea-surface temperatures of 5-16°C.","The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin primarily feeds on small fish and squid. Preferred prey species include Atlantic herring ( Clupea harengus), small Atlantic mackerel ( Scomber scombrus), silvery pout ( Gadiculus argenteus), blue whiting ( Micromesistius poutassou), American sand lance (Ammodytes americanus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), silver hake ( Merluccius bilinearis), and northern shortfin squid (/llex illecebrosus). Although little is known about foraging strategies, Atlantic White-sided Dolphins have been observed hunting cooperatively by herding fish into tight balls against the water’s surface.","Breeding of Atlantic White-sided Dolphins peaks in June-July in the West Atlantic Ocean and extends into autumn in the East Atlantic Ocean. Gestation is c.11 months, and young are weaned by 18 months. Females are sexually mature at 6-12 years, and males reach sexual maturity at 7-11 years. Longevity is ¢.27 years for females and c¢.22 years for males. Breeding females will typically have an offspring every two years. Studies of genetic variability of stranded groups suggest that mating is random. On following pages: 3. Peale’s Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus australis ); 4. Hourglass Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus crucigen; 5. Pacific White-sided Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obliquidens ); 6. Dusky Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obscurus ); 7. Irrawaddy Dolphin ( Orcaella brevirostris ); 8. Australian Snubfin Dolphin ( Orcaella heinsohni ).","The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin is known to frequently tail-slap, breach acrobatically (especially in larger groups), bow ride, and surf in stern wakes of vessels. Frequent breaching is the source of the common name “Jumper.” They have even been observed riding “bow waves” of mysticetes. Dives usually last less than a minute, and maximum dive time is about four minutes.","Group sizes of Atlantic White-sided Dolphins tend to vary geographically. Inshore groups near Newfoundland, Canada, typically contain 50-60 individuals. Off New England, USA, groups vary from a few to several hundred individuals, but average c.40 individuals. Off Iceland and around the British Isles, group size is usually less than ten individuals. Most groups consist of less than 100 individuals, but groups of several thousand have been observed. Within these large groups, there may be a few stable subgroups. Reproductive groups contain breeding females, adult males, and young offspring and tend to remain segregated from groups that contain older juveniles. Studies of genetic variability of stranded groups suggest that both sexes disperse from their natal groups. Mixed-species aggregations with the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus), the Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and the Long-finned Pilot Whale ( Globicephala melas ) have been observed. In some areas, such as off Newfoundland where Atlantic White-sided Dolphins are more abundant in July-October, they appear to have seasonal inshore—offshore movements. These may be correlated with seasonal variation in prey abundance related to upwelling and sea-surface temperature.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Abundance of the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin is estimated to be more than 100,000 individuals, and there are no reports of population declines or major threats. There are ¢.51,640 individuals off eastern North America, c.11,740 individuals in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Canada), and ¢.96,000 individuals off western Scotland. The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin has historically been taken in drive fisheries in Greenland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and Newfoundland. Currently, they are hunted opportunistically in Greenland and eastern Canada. Drives in the Faroe Islands also continue: 300-600 Atlantic White-sided Dolphins were killed per year in 2004-2006. These drives do not appear to have as long a history as drives for pilot whales. Incidental catches of the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin have been reported in fisheries from Canada, the USA, the UK, and Ireland. They may be especially vulnerable to capture in pelagic trawl fisheries that target mackerel ( Scomber spp. ). Incidental catch rates of the western North Atlantic stock in gillnet and trawl fisheries were ¢.352 ind/year in 2002-2006. Atlantic Whitesided Dolphins will feed behind trawl nets, which may make them more vulnerable to incidental catch. Contamination from heavy metals and organochlorine pollutants have been reported in a few specimens, but effects of pollutants are not well understood.","Cipriano (2009) | Couperus (1997) | Craddock et al.

There is a white streak at lateral dark-gray/medium-gray borderstretching from leading edge of dorsal fin to midway along tailstock, and yellow-orange streak at lower margin of lateral dark-gray section stretching from midway along tailstock to base of flukes. Male Atlantic White-sided Dolphins tend to have deeper tailstocks than females, and immature individuals have more muted coloration. There are 30-40 small, conical teeth in each jaw. Habitat. Cold temperate and subarctic waters, 100-300 m deep, over outer continental shelves. Nevertheless, Atlantic White-sided Dolphins may enter fjords and inlets less than 50 m deep. They prefer sea-surface temperatures of 5-16°C. Food and Feeding. The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin primarily feeds on small fish and squid. Preferred prey species include Atlantic herring ( Clupea harengus), small Atlantic mackerel ( Scomber scombrus), silvery pout ( Gadiculus argenteus), blue whiting ( Micromesistius poutassou), American sand lance (Ammodytes americanus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), silver hake ( Merluccius bilinearis), and northern shortfin squid (/llex illecebrosus). Although little is known about foraging strategies, Atlantic White-sided Dolphins have been observed hunting cooperatively by herding fish into tight balls against the water’s surface. Breeding. Breeding of Atlantic White-sided Dolphins peaks in June-July in the West Atlantic Ocean and extends into autumn in the East Atlantic Ocean. Gestation is c.11 months, and young are weaned by 18 months. Females are sexually mature at 6-12 years, and males reach sexual maturity at 7-11 years. Longevity is ¢.27 years for females and c¢.22 years for males. Breeding females will typically have an offspring every two years. Studies of genetic variability of stranded groups suggest that mating is random. On following pages: 3. Peale’s Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus australis ); 4. Hourglass Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus crucigen; 5. Pacific White-sided Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obliquidens ); 6. Dusky Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obscurus ); 7. Irrawaddy Dolphin ( Orcaella brevirostris ); 8. Australian Snubfin Dolphin ( Orcaella heinsohni ). Activity patterns. The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin is known to frequently tail-slap, breach acrobatically (especially in larger groups), bow ride, and surf in stern wakes of vessels. Frequent breaching is the source of the common name “Jumper.” They have even been observed riding “bow waves” of mysticetes. Dives usually last less than a minute, and maximum dive time is about four minutes. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Group sizes of Atlantic White-sided Dolphins tend to vary geographically. Inshore groups near Newfoundland, Canada, typically contain 50-60 individuals. Off New England, USA, groups vary from a few to several hundred individuals, but average c.40 individuals. Off Iceland and around the British Isles, group size is usually less than ten individuals. Most groups consist of less than 100 individuals, but groups of several thousand have been observed. Within these large groups, there may be a few stable subgroups. Reproductive groups contain breeding females, adult males, and young offspring and tend to remain segregated from groups that contain older juveniles. Studies of genetic variability of stranded groups suggest that both sexes disperse from their natal groups. Mixed-species aggregations with the Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus), the Humpback Whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), and the Long-finned Pilot Whale ( Globicephala melas ) have been observed. In some areas, such as off Newfoundland where Atlantic White-sided Dolphins are more abundant in July-October, they appear to have seasonal inshore—offshore movements. These may be correlated with seasonal variation in prey abundance related to upwelling and sea-surface temperature. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Abundance of the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin is estimated to be more than 100,000 individuals, and there are no reports of population declines or major threats. There are ¢.51,640 individuals off eastern North America, c.11,740 individuals in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Canada), and ¢.96,000 individuals off western Scotland. The Atlantic White-sided Dolphin has historically been taken in drive fisheries in Greenland, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and Newfoundland. Currently, they are hunted opportunistically in Greenland and eastern Canada. Drives in the Faroe Islands also continue: 300-600 Atlantic White-sided Dolphins were killed per year in 2004-2006. These drives do not appear to have as long a history as drives for pilot whales. Incidental catches of the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin have been reported in fisheries from Canada, the USA, the UK, and Ireland. They may be especially vulnerable to capture in pelagic trawl fisheries that target mackerel ( Scomber spp. ). Incidental catch rates of the western North Atlantic stock in gillnet and trawl fisheries were ¢.352 ind/year in 2002-2006. Atlantic Whitesided Dolphins will feed behind trawl nets, which may make them more vulnerable to incidental catch. Contamination from heavy metals and organochlorine pollutants have been reported in a few specimens, but effects of pollutants are not well understood. Bibliography.

The Melonheaded Whale also may prey opportunistically on common dolphins ( Delphinus spp. ) escaping from or injured in the purse-seine fisheries for yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares) in eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. A recent study suggested that offshore eddies off Hawaii may be preferred foraging habitat for local populations of Melon-headed Whales.","There is no specific information available for this species, but inconclusive evidence suggests that peak breeding of Melon-headed Whales occurs in July-August, and sexual maturity occurs at c.11-5 years for females and c.15 years for males.","Little is currently known about the behavior of the Melon-headed Whale. Prior to the 1960s,it was only known from skeletal remains. Sightings of Melonheaded Whales at sea indicate that individuals “porpoise” or shallowly leap out of the water when traveling fast and may occasionally breach, spy-hop, and bow ride.

Mixed-species groups are also common and usually include Fraser’s Dolphin ( Lagenodelphis hosei ), the Spinner Dolphin ( Stenella longuostris), the Atlantic Spotted Dolphin ( Stenella frontalis ), the Common Bottlenose Dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ), and the Rough-toothed Dolphin ( Steno bredanensis ). The Melon-headed Whale is also known for mass strandings, which are increasing in frequency in the North Pacific Ocean. Reports from two strandings—one from Japan and the other from Brazil—revealed high parasite loads in stranded specimens. This may have physically impaired navigation of a few individuals in the groups, causing the other individuals to follow suite due to the species’ strong sociality. In several mass strandings, sex ratio has been female biased (c.1:2), which also implicates socially related behavioral segregation and strong female—female association. No migrations are currently known for the Melon-headed Whale, and little data exists on movement and residency patterns. Sightings at higher latitudes suggest that they follow warm-water currents. Repeated resightings of individuals off the Hawaiian Islands suggest some site fidelity, and more recent work shows evidence that there are two resident, demographically independent, populations: one limited to the north-western area of the Hawaiian Islands and the other ranging throughout the main archipelago.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Global abundance of the Melon-headed Whale is estimated at more than 50,000 individuals, but there are currently no estimates of global population trends. High global abundance, a large distribution, and mostly localized threats mean that a 30% reduction in abundance during the next three generations is unlikely. There are an estimated 45,400 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, 3451 individuals in the Gulf of Mexico, 2947 individuals off Hawaii, and ¢.2200 individuals around the Philippines. The Melon-headed Whale is taken as direct catch in subsistence fisheries in the Caribbean and off Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Philippines, mostly for human consumption and for use as bait in other fisheries. They also are taken occasionally in the infamous Taiji drive fishery ofJapan, and individuals caught live there sometimes have been sold for captive display in aquaria, although the Melon-headed Whale is notorious for being aggressive and difficult to train. The Melon-headed Whale is also sometimes incidentally caught in driftnet fisheries throughout the tropical Pacific Ocean and yellowfin tuna purse-seine fisheries. None of these fisheries, where the Melon-headed Whale is either directly or indirectly caught, is extensively monitored, so their effect on local populations is unknown. Examination of stranded specimens from Japanese coasts has showed high concentrations of heavy metals (e.g. cadmium, and mercury) and high, although decreasing (over the last ¢.30 years), levels of PCBs and DDT. Concentrations of PBDEs have been increasing over the last 20 years. The Melon-headed Whale is also vulnerable to loud anthropogenic noise. Military training exercises around the Hawaiian Islands were implicated in anomalous movements or “near stranding” of a group of 150-200 Melon-headed Whales into a shallow, confined bay in Kauai, Hawaii; they stayed for more than 28 hours, presumably to avoid the noise. Stranded specimens have also been found to have swallowed various plastic items, which may have been partly responsible for their deaths.","Aschettino et al. (2012) | Barlow (2006) | Dolar et al.

The Melon-headed Whale is also known for mass strandings, which are increasing in frequency in the North Pacific Ocean. Reports from two strandings—one from Japan and the other from Brazil—revealed high parasite loads in stranded specimens. This may have physically impaired navigation of a few individuals in the groups, causing the other individuals to follow suite due to the species’ strong sociality. In several mass strandings, sex ratio has been female biased (c.1:2), which also implicates socially related behavioral segregation and strong female—female association. No migrations are currently known for the Melon-headed Whale, and little data exists on movement and residency patterns. Sightings at higher latitudes suggest that they follow warm-water currents. Repeated resightings of individuals off the Hawaiian Islands suggest some site fidelity, and more recent work shows evidence that there are two resident, demographically independent, populations: one limited to the north-western area of the Hawaiian Islands and the other ranging throughout the main archipelago. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Global abundance of the Melon-headed Whale is estimated at more than 50,000 individuals, but there are currently no estimates of global population trends. High global abundance, a large distribution, and mostly localized threats mean that a 30% reduction in abundance during the next three generations is unlikely. There are an estimated 45,400 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, 3451 individuals in the Gulf of Mexico, 2947 individuals off Hawaii, and ¢.2200 individuals around the Philippines. The Melon-headed Whale is taken as direct catch in subsistence fisheries in the Caribbean and off Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Philippines, mostly for human consumption and for use as bait in other fisheries. They also are taken occasionally in the infamous Taiji drive fishery ofJapan, and individuals caught live there sometimes have been sold for captive display in aquaria, although the Melon-headed Whale is notorious for being aggressive and difficult to train. The Melon-headed Whale is also sometimes incidentally caught in driftnet fisheries throughout the tropical Pacific Ocean and yellowfin tuna purse-seine fisheries. None of these fisheries, where the Melon-headed Whale is either directly or indirectly caught, is extensively monitored, so their effect on local populations is unknown. Examination of stranded specimens from Japanese coasts has showed high concentrations of heavy metals (e.g. cadmium, and mercury) and high, although decreasing (over the last ¢.30 years), levels of PCBs and DDT. Concentrations of PBDEs have been increasing over the last 20 years. The Melon-headed Whale is also vulnerable to loud anthropogenic noise. Military training exercises around the Hawaiian Islands were implicated in anomalous movements or “near stranding” of a group of 150-200 Melon-headed Whales into a shallow, confined bay in Kauai, Hawaii; they stayed for more than 28 hours, presumably to avoid the noise. Stranded specimens have also been found to have swallowed various plastic items, which may have been partly responsible for their deaths. Bibliography. Aschettino et al.

There is no notable sexual dimorphism in Risso’s Dolphins. Neonates are 110-150 cm long and weigh 20-30 kg. Risso’s Dolphin has robust body shape; narrow tailstock; and bulbous, squarish head, with barely discernable beak. It has unique, deep vertical cleft or groove that runs along anterior side of rostrum and melon. Flippers are sickle-shaped, and dorsal fin is tall and falcate, positioned about halfway along body. Risso’s Dolphin is one of the most heavily scarred species of delphinids, with white scratches and blotches covering most of body. These scars, which are healed wounds from squid beaks and suckers, or teeth from other Risso’s Dolphins, contrast with underlying dark to pale-gray skin. White patches are found on ventral body between pectoral fins and around urogenital region. Young individuals are usually darker than adults, sometimes with a brownish tinge, and have few scars. Skin of young Risso’s Dolphins darkens to a near black before becoming paler at sexual maturity. Only dorsal fin may remain darkly colored in adulthood. There are 0-2 (generally unerupted) pairs of teeth in upper jaw and 2-7 pairs in lower jaw. Teeth are often worn or missing in older individuals.","Primarily deep waters (400-1000 m) offshore from the continental slopes, where sea-surface temperature is 15-25°C. Risso’s Dolphin is rarely found in water less than 10°C, which results in seasonal population movements in some parts of the world. It prefers habitat over escarpments and steep seafloor topography, resulting in an overall patchy distribution that loosely outlines continents and major oceanic islands. There is evidence, however, that habitat use by Risso’s Dolphin is coordinated to avoid spatial overlap with Cuvier’s Beaked Whale (Ziphius cavirostris) or temporally with the Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus). Risso’s Dolphin was once uncommon off southern California, but a permanent increase in its abundance occurred in the region after the 1982-1983 El Nino.","Risso’s Dolphin feeds primarily on cephalopods, which explains their habitat preference for steep bottom slopes. These areas are often subject to upwelling and are typically productive and ideal for hunting vertically migrating, mesopelagic prey. Because cephalopods usually migrate closer to the surface at night with the deep scattering layer, Risso’s Dolphin is a nocturnal feeder. Commonly documented prey include common octopus (Octopus vulgaris), greater argonaut ( Argonauta argo), neon flying squid ( Ommastrephes bartrami), European flying squid ( Todarodes sagittatus), reverse jewel squid ( Histioteuthis reversa), and various other species in the families Argonautidae , Ommastrephidae , Histioteuthidae , and Onychoteuthidae .","Breeding of Risso’s Dolphin appears to peak during summer in the North Atlantic Ocean and occurs throughout the year in the North Pacific Ocean. Sexual maturity is attained when both sexes reach body lengths of 260-277 cm. This is thought to correspond to ¢.8-10 years of age for females and c.10-12 years for males. Gestation is thought to be 13-14 months, and reproductive females have an offspring every 2-4 years. Individuals may live up to 35 years.","Risso’s Dolphins occasionally behave energetically by breaching or “porpoising” while traveling and surfing on swells, but they more often surface slowly. They are nocturnal foragers, but there are currently no robust data on diving patterns or activity budgets. Risso’s Dolphin is not shy of boats and will occasionally bow-ride or surf in wakes.","Groups are typically 10-50 individuals, but groups of up to 4000 individuals have been documented. Social subunits within groups may be segregated by sex and age, and long-term bonds may form among groups of 3—12 individuals. These bonds may be among individuals ofthe same or opposite sex. Juveniles remain in their mother’s group until sexual maturity, and mature males likely move more frequently among groups than females do. Groups of Risso’s Dolphin may temporarily associate with individuals of other cetacean species, including other delphinids, such as the Pacific White-sided Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus obliquidens ), Fraser's Dolphin ( Lagenodelphis hose), or the Northern Right-whale Dolphin ( Lissodelphis borealis ), and larger species such as the Gray Whale (Eschrichtius robustus). Regular interspecific interactions and possibly persistent social bonds have been documented among Risso’s Dolphins, Striped Dolphins ( Stenella coeruleoalba ), and Short-beaked Common Dolphins ( Delphinus delphis ) in the Gulf of Corinth off Greece. Site fidelity of Risso’s Dolphins seems to be related to environmental constancy or seasonality. In less variable regions, such as off the Azores, there is greater residency than in areas where sea-surface temperature fluctuates widely during the year. Some populations of Risso’s Dolphins are known to migrate between the Mediterranean Sea in winter for breeding and waters off northern Scotland in summer for feeding. Similar seasonal breeding and feeding migrations are observed off England, South Africa, and Japan.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List.

There are currently no global estimates of abundance or population trends for Risso’s Dolphins, but combined threats suggest that a 30% reduction in its abundance over the next three generations (60 years) is unlikely. There are ¢.16,066 individuals in population off California, Oregon, and Washington, USA; 2351 individuals off Hawaii; 5500-13,000 individuals off Sri Lanka; 1514 individuals in the Sulu Sea; 20,479 off the eastern USA; 2169 individuals in the northern Gulf of Mexico; 83,300 individuals offJapan; and ¢.175,000 individuals in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Risso’s Dolphin is hunted by small-scale fisheries in Sri Lanka (up to 1300 dolphins taken annually) and Japan (250-500 dolphins taken annually) for food, fish bait, and fertilizer, but mercury levels in the meat of Risso’s Dolphins, as in most small cetaceans, are high enough to be considered unsafe for human consumption.

Monotypic.","Tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters worldwide from ¢.50° N to ¢.40° S, including the Red Sea, but excluding the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf.","Total length 720 cm (males) and 550 cm (females); weight 3500 kg (males) and 1500 kg (females). Neonates are 140-190 cm long and weigh 40-80 kg. Like the Long-finned Pilot Whale ( G. melas ), the Short-finned Pilot Whale has bulbous head, small beak, and deep tailstock. Key features that distinguish it from the Longfinned Pilot Whale are its shorter flippers (14-19% of total body length). Falcate dorsal fin with wide base is positioned approximately one-third of body length back from snout. Skin pigmentation ranges from dark gray or brown to black. Adults possess white or pale gray patches on chest and urogenital area, behind dorsal fin, and above eyes. Thin white mid-ventral line mayjoin chest and urogenital patches. Young, sexually immature individuals have paler skin than adults. Like the Long-finned Pilot Whale, the Short-finned Pilot Whale is very sexually dimorphic in size, with males larger than females. Males have more bulbous, often square-shaped rostra, larger dorsalfins, and longer flippers than females. Each jaw contains 7-9 pairs of teeth. Two distinct forms found off northern and southern Japan differ slightly in size (the northern form is larger) and cranial and external morphology.","Global tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters. Although the Short-finned Pilot Whale is found in coastal and offshore waters, it appears to prefer deeper (600-1000 m) offshore habitat over outer continental slopes. It is mostly nomadic, but a few resident populations are found off coastal California and Hawaii. The two distinct forms found off northern and southern Japan also appear to be resident. Populations of Long-finned Pilot Whale are known to have occupied waters offJapan until the 12"" century, and it has been hypothesized that Short-finned Pilot Whales have since expanded their distribution in this area as a result of the former species’ extirpation.","The Short-finned Pilot Whale prefers to forage on deep-dwelling species, primarily cephalopods, and uses energetic “sprints” to chase down targeted prey. Because most cephalopods move,closer to the water’s surface at night, the Shortfinned Pilot Whale is a nocturnal hunter and most actively feeds at dawn and dusk at depths of 300-500 m. Foraging dives can last up to 27 minutes. Documented prey species include European flying squid (7odarodes sagittatus), glass squid (Cranchia sp. and Megalocranchia sp.), common arm squid (Brachioteuthis riser), cranch squid (7aonius pavo), reverse jewel squid ( Histioteuthis reversa ), and Bean's bigscale (Scopelogadus beanit).","Mating system of the Short-finned Pilot Whale is likely polygynous. Breeding peaks in autumn and winter in the Northern Hemisphere and in spring and autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. Gestation lasts 15-16 months. The birthing interval of the Short-finned Pilot Whale, as with the Long-finned Pilot Whale, is among the longest known in cetaceans, at 3-5 years. This long span accommodates an unusually long lactation period that lasts c.3 years on average, and it likely plays an important role in reinforcing social bonds. Males reach sexual maturity later (13-17 years) than females (8-9 years). Females live almost twice as long (up to 63 years) as males (30-45 years), and post-reproductive female longevity is common, occurring at ¢.40 years. Females may lactate for up to 15 years after they are no longer reproductive, an adaptation that likely improves survivability of closely related young individuals such as grandoffspring.","Because the Short-finned Pilot Whale primarily forages at night, dives tend to be shallower during the day rarely exceeding 100 m. Behaviors during the day consist primarily of socializing, resting, and traveling. While hunting or traveling, individuals in groups will organize themselves into a long “chorus line” that can be up to 3-2 km wide and only a few individuals deep. While resting, the group will remain relatively stationary, with individuals rafted closely together, almost touching. The Short-finned Pilot Whale is only moderately active aerially. Groups may “porpoise” while traveling, and individuals may spy-hop, but breaching is less common.","Both species of pilot whales are highly social and have stable, matrilineal social structures. The Short-finned Pilot Whale will travel in groups of 15-50 individuals, although large groups of several hundred individuals have been documented. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, the Shortfinned Pilot Whale occurs in mixed-species groups with a variety of other cetacean species, including the Common Bottlenose Dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ) and various species of Stenella in tuna ( Thunnus )—dolphin aggregations. Social vocalizations have a mean frequency of 7870 Hz, higher than vocalizations of the Long-finned Pilot Whale at 4480 Hz. Matrilines tend to have a slightly female-biased sex ratio and consist of a matriarch and her immediate kin. Strong natal group philopatry is exhibited by both sexes, but by males especially. Like the Long-finned Pilot Whale, male Short-finned Pilot Whales will mate during temporary aggregations of separate family groups but will otherwise remain in their own matrilines for their entire lives. Matrilines also have distinct call repertoires, a cultural trait expected from a species with stable social structure, and similar in nature to the clan-specific dialects of another matrilineal delphinid such as the Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ). Like the Long-finned Pilot Whale, the Shortfinned Pilot Whale is also prone to mass stranding. Their strong social bonds contribute to this vulnerability because a leading individual that makes a navigational error is likely to be followed instinctively by the rest of the group. This kind of conformity has even resulted in individuals restranding after being pushed back out to sea. Cases of mass stranding may be triggered by individuals who have had their navigational abilities impaired by acoustically related injuries (e.g. from seismic surveys), but in regions where they are regular, such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the British and US Virgin Islands, coastal configuration and bottom topography may be to blame, either by being complex to navigate or by interfering with local geomagnetic contours. The Short-finned Pilot Whale does not appear to be migratory. It is found throughout the year in some regions, such as off Hawaii and the Canary Islands, although recent studies suggest there may be several populations in Hawaii with varying degrees ofsite fidelity. In other regions such as off southern California, Short-finned Pilot Whales have seasonal inshore—offshore movements that are likely related to fluctuating cephalopod abundance.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Taxonomy of the Short-finned Pilot Whale is currently in dispute, and if new species or subspecies are classified, they may warrant a threatened listing. Global abundance estimates and trend data are not currently available for the Short-finned Pilot Whale, but they do exist for several areas. OffJapan, the northern form is estimated at 4000-5000 individuals and the southern form at ¢.14,000 individuals. There are ¢.7500 individuals off the Philippines, ¢.589,000 individuals in the eastern Pacific Ocean, ¢.8846 individuals off Hawaii, ¢.2388 individuals in the Gulf of Mexico, and ¢.300 individuals off the west coast of North America. The most serious threats are direct and incidental catch. In Japan, several hundred Short-finned Pilot Whales were killed annually in drive fisheries for centuries, but the national quota is now 50 ind/ year. Nevertheless, in recent years, the southern form has sustained a higher catch rate than the northern form (1755 southern individuals were taken in 1982-1985), and it has decreased drastically in abundance since the 1980s. Its population is now considered “depleted.” A fishery operating off the Lesser Antilles takes ¢.220 ind/year, and unmonitored fisheries in Indonesia and Sri Lanka also are known to kill the Shortfinned Pilot Whale. It is harpooned illegally and opportunistically in fisheries from the Visayas, Mindanao, and Philippines. In these direct catches, meatis usually sold as food for human consumption or used as bait in other fisheries. The Short-finned Pilot Whale also is taken incidentally in both Atlantic and Pacific waters off the USA, primarily in squid fisheries, although catch rates currently do not exceed legally allowable limits. In the western Pacific Ocean, 350-750 individuals are killed incidentally every year in passive nets or traps set by Japanese fisheries. Effect of mortality from incidental catch on populations has not yet been quantified, and incidental catch is probably underestimated in most of the distribution of the Short-finned Pilot Whale due to a lack of monitoring. For example, an unknown number of Short-finned Pilot Whales are caught annually in pelagic driftnets off the east coast of Taiwan. Gunshot and spear wounds observed on individuals off Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands also suggest that aggressive fishermen are a threat in some regions. Contaminant-related health problems may also be an issue for some populations of Short-finned Pilot Whales. High concentrations of DDT and PCB have been found in individuals off the west coast of the USA. Avoidance behavior by the Short-finned Pilot Whale also has been observed in response to whale-watching vessels, suggesting that tourist activity may have negative effects in some areas. The Short-finned Pilot Whale’s propensity for mass stranding, and its preference for deep-dwelling prey, mean that it is particularly vulnerable to loud anthropogenic noise. Large-scale military exercises around Taiwan in 2004, for example, coincided with a series of stranding events of Short-finned Pilot Whales.","Barlow (2006) | Bernard & Reilly (1999) | Bustamante et al.

It currently consists of two subspecies, a northern form ( melas ) and a southern form (edwardii), but full species status has also been argued for these taxa. There is also some morphological evidence that the northern form itself may consist of two forms, north-eastern and north-western, which are geographically segregated by gyre currents of the North Atlantic Ocean. Skulls from Japan indicate that a subspecies (as yet unnamed) existed in north-western Pacific Ocean from the 8"" to the 12"" centuries. Two subspecies recognized.","G.m.melasTraill,1809—NAtlanticOceannofartherSthanapproximatelytheTropicofCancer,includingtheBarentsSea,WMediterraneanSea,NorthSea,andGulfofSaintLawrence. G. m. edwardii Smith, 1834 — circumglobal in the Southern Ocean from 14° S to 68° S.","Total length 670 cm (males) and 570 cm (females); weight 2300 kg (males) and 1300 kg (females). Neonates are 170-180 cm long and weigh c.75 kg. Like the Short-finned Pilot Whale ( G. macrorhynchus ), the Long-finned Pilot Whale has bulbous head; slight, barely visible beak; and deep tailstock. Key feature that distinguishes it from the Short-finned Pilot Whale (and the source of its common name) is pair of very long flippers (18-27% of total body length) that curve to form a pronounced “elbow.” Dorsal fin is falcate, with wide base, and is positioned one-third of body length back from snout. Skin pigmentation ranges from a dark gray or brown to black, with several white or pale-gray patches. These include chest patch between flippers that tapers into midline and extends into another patch in urogenital region; saddle patch behind dorsal fin; and eyebrow streaks. Eyebrow streaks and saddle patch may be connected by thin gray lateral line, creating a “cape” shape. This feature is more common in the “Southern Long-finned Pilot Whale” (G. m. edwardii) in the Southern Hemisphere than the “Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale (G. m. melas ) in the Northern Hemisphere. Young sexually immature individuals have paler skin than adults. Like the Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ) and the Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus), the Long-finned Pilot Whale is very sexually dimorphic in size, with males largely than females. Males also tend to have more bulbous rostra, larger dorsal fins and flippers, and deepertailstocks than females. Each jaw contains 8-13 pairs of teeth.","Coastal and oceanic waters, apparently preferring habitat over continental shelf breaks and slopes. Both the northern and southern subspecies of the Longfinned Pilot Whale have anti-tropical distributions, limited to temperate and subarctic regions and to sea-surface temperatures of 0-25°C.","The Long-finned Pilot Whale is a deep diver and generally feeds at depths of 300-1800 m, using echolocation frequencies similar to those of bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops spp. ). Foraging dives last an average of 18 minutes. Prey species primarily consist of small cephalopods, but small to medium-sized fish suffice as alternatives. Small cephalopods migrate closer to the surface at night as part of the rising deep scattering layer, and consequently, foraging activity by the Long-finned Pilot Whale tends to be nocturnal. In the western North Atlantic Ocean, the primary prey species of the Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale are northern shortfin squid (/llex illecebrosus), Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ), and Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). In the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, primary prey includes European flying squid ( Todarodes sagittatus ) and various species of armhook squid (Gonatus spp.). Populations of Southern Long-finned Pilot Whales in the Southern Hemisphere appear to feed more exclusively on cephalopods.","Mating system of the Long-finned Pilot Whale is likely polygynous. Mating activity can occur throughout the year, but it is most frequent in each hemisphere’s respective spring and summer. Gestation lasts c.12 months. Birth interval of the Longfinned Pilot Whale is one of the longest among cetaceans at 3-5 years. This long span accommodates an unusually long lactation period that lasts c.3 years on average. In an offspring’s later years, lactation is less nutritionally necessary and instead likely plays an important role in reinforcing social bonds. Males reach sexual maturity later (c.12 years) than females (c.8 years). Females live almost twice as long (60 years) as males (30-45 years), and post-reproductive female longevity is common.","Because of their nocturnal foraging habits, the Long-finned Pilot Whale has a dive profile that alternates between deep (more than 100 m) at night and shallow (less than 16 m) during the day. Surface behavior consists mostly of resting and socializing. Resting is most common at sunrise after a night of foraging and individuals will often raft together in groups. Pairs may synchronize swimming patterns for antipredatory and social purposes. The Long-finned Pilot Whale can be somewhat aerially active, “porpoising” while traveling and spy hopping. Breaching is less common.","The Long-finned Pilot Whale is highly social and will travel in groups of 20-100 individuals, although groups of more than 1000 individuals have been reported. Large groups consist of smaller social subunits of 10-20 individuals. The Long-finned Pilot Whale has also been observed in mixed-species groups with a variety of other delphinids, the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus acutus ) and the Common Bottlenose Dolphin being most common. Social vocalizations of the Long-finned Pilot Whale have a mean frequency of 4480 Hz, lower than vocalizations of the Short-finned Pilot Whale at 7870 Hz. Photo-identification and genetic studies have indicated a stable, matrilineal social structure similar to that of the Killer Whale. These matrilineal units (matrilines) tend to have a slightly female-biased sex ratio and consist of a matriarch and her immediate kin. Strong natal group philopatry is exhibited by both sexes, males especially. Males will mate during temporary aggregations of separate family groups but will otherwise remain in their own matrilines for their entire lives. In the western North Atlantic Ocean, Northern Long-finned Pilot Whales show seasonal inshore—offshore movement. They move toward the edge of the continental shelf from mid-winter to early spring and toward inshore waters of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Canada, in summer and autumn. These movements have been correlated with spawning of cephalopod prey species in the region. Long-Finned Pilot Whales occur around the Faroe Islands throughout the year, with peak abundance in late summer. They are among the species most often associated with mass strandings, which are especially common at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, in October—January. This behavior is poorly understood because mass-stranded individuals usually appear physically healthy (single strandings are more often associated with pathological problems), and they may restrand themselves after being assisted off a beach. If the Long-finned Pilot Whale can attune to the earth’s magnetic field to assist in navigation, they may be driven astray by geomagnetic anomalies. Because of their strong social bonds, a group may follow a confused, diseased, or injured individual that has made a navigational mistake.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Neither subspecies of the Long-finned Pilot Whale has been assessed, but the subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea is listed as Data Deficient. Abundance of the Long-finned Pilot Whale is ¢.200,000 individuals in Antarctic waters, c.13,000 individuals off eastern Canada, and ¢.780,000 individuals in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Overall population trend of the Long-finned Pilot Whale is unknown, but probable declines driven by a combination of threats suggest a 30% reduction in global population size over the next three generations (72 years). The most serious threats are direct and incidental catch. Stable social structure of the Long-finned Pilot Whale has made them easy to herd and ideal hunting targets. Harvesting of the Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale takes place currently off the Faroe Islands and Greenland only, but drive fisheries historically operated off Newfoundland (Canada), Cape Cod (USA), Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and the Falkland Islands. From 1947 to 1971, drive fisheries off Newfoundland killed 54,000 individuals, but this population is now thought to be recovering. There has been large-scale whaling off the Faroe Islands since the 9"" century, and annual records dating from 1584 show an average catch of 850 ind/year. Despite this catch rate, the Faroe Islands fishery is considered to be sustainable. Meat, blubber, and oil are the primary commodities. The Long-finned Pilot Whale is also vulnerable to incidental catch in other fisheries, and it seems especially susceptible to entanglement in driftnets. Effects of mortality related to incidental catch have not been quantified. In waters off the north-eastern USA, the Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale is commonly taken in mackerel, herring, and squid fisheries operating over the continental shelf break. Reported takes in the USA do not exceed legally allowable annual quotas, but documented takes likely underestimate actual numbers. In British waters, incidental takes of Northern Long-finned Pilot Whales are common in gillnet, purse-seine, and trawl fisheries operating off south-western Britain, and they have been linked to strandings in the region, which have increased significantly since the 1970s. Incidental takes also occur in fisheries operating in the Mediterranean Sea and off Hawaii. There are few reports of incidental catch in the Southern Hemisphere, but the Southern Long-finned Pilot Whale may be susceptible to driftnet fisheries that target sharks off southern Brazil. Environmental contaminants are also a major threat. In the North Atlantic Ocean, populations of Northern Long-finned Pilot Whales are heavily contaminated with various organochlorine compounds, including PCBs and DDT. Populations off the Faroe Islands are also exposed to high levels of heavy metals, mainly cadmium and mercury, which have bioaccumulated in prey species. These contaminants are known to cause pathological problems, such as immunosuppression and reproductive failure, in other marine mammal species, but such issues have rarely been reported for the Long-finned Pilot Whale. Other threats include noise disturbance from military sonar and seismic surveying, ship strikes, overfishing of prey species, live capture for marine parks, and effects of climate change on habitat and prey availability.","Amos et al.

Long-finned Pilot Whale Globicephala melas French: Globicéphale noir / German: Langflossen-Grindwal / Spanish: Calderén de aleta larga Other common names: Atlantic Pilot Whale , Caaing Whale , Common Blackfish , Common Pilot Whale , Northern Pilot Whale , Pothead Whale; North Atlantic Long-finned Pilot Whale (melas); Southern Long-finned Pilot Whale (edward) Taxonomy. Delphinus melas Traill, 1809 , “in Scapay Bay, in Pomona, one of the Orkneys,” Scotland, UK . Taxonomy of G. melas is currently in dispute. It currently consists of two subspecies, a northern form ( melas ) and a southern form (edwardii), but full species status has also been argued for these taxa. There is also some morphological evidence that the northern form itself may consist of two forms, north-eastern and north-western, which are geographically segregated by gyre currents of the North Atlantic Ocean. Skulls from Japan indicate that a subspecies (as yet unnamed) existed in north-western Pacific Ocean from the 8"" to the 12"" centuries. Two subspecies recognized. Subspecies and Distribution. G.m.melasTraill,1809—NAtlanticOceannofartherSthanapproximatelytheTropicofCancer,includingtheBarentsSea,WMediterraneanSea,NorthSea,andGulfofSaintLawrence. G. m. edwardii Smith, 1834 — circumglobal in the Southern Ocean from 14° S to 68° S. Descriptive notes. Total length 670 cm (males) and 570 cm (females); weight 2300 kg (males) and 1300 kg (females). Neonates are 170-180 cm long and weigh c.75 kg. Like the Short-finned Pilot Whale ( G. macrorhynchus ), the Long-finned Pilot Whale has bulbous head; slight, barely visible beak; and deep tailstock. Key feature that distinguishes it from the Short-finned Pilot Whale (and the source of its common name) is pair of very long flippers (18-27% of total body length) that curve to form a pronounced “elbow.” Dorsal fin is falcate, with wide base, and is positioned one-third of body length back from snout. Skin pigmentation ranges from a dark gray or brown to black, with several white or pale-gray patches. These include chest patch between flippers that tapers into midline and extends into another patch in urogenital region; saddle patch behind dorsal fin; and eyebrow streaks. Eyebrow streaks and saddle patch may be connected by thin gray lateral line, creating a “cape” shape. This feature is more common in the “Southern Long-finned Pilot Whale” (G. m. edwardii) in the Southern Hemisphere than the “Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale (G. m. melas ) in the Northern Hemisphere. Young sexually immature individuals have paler skin than adults. Like the Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ) and the Sperm Whale (Physeter macrocephalus), the Long-finned Pilot Whale is very sexually dimorphic in size, with males largely than females. Males also tend to have more bulbous rostra, larger dorsal fins and flippers, and deepertailstocks than females. Each jaw contains 8-13 pairs of teeth. Habitat. Coastal and oceanic waters, apparently preferring habitat over continental shelf breaks and slopes. Both the northern and southern subspecies of the Longfinned Pilot Whale have anti-tropical distributions, limited to temperate and subarctic regions and to sea-surface temperatures of 0-25°C. Food and Feeding. The Long-finned Pilot Whale is a deep diver and generally feeds at depths of 300-1800 m, using echolocation frequencies similar to those of bottlenose dolphins ( Tursiops spp. ). Foraging dives last an average of 18 minutes. Prey species primarily consist of small cephalopods, but small to medium-sized fish suffice as alternatives. Small cephalopods migrate closer to the surface at night as part of the rising deep scattering layer, and consequently, foraging activity by the Long-finned Pilot Whale tends to be nocturnal. In the western North Atlantic Ocean, the primary prey species of the Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale are northern shortfin squid (/llex illecebrosus), Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua ), and Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). In the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, primary prey includes European flying squid ( Todarodes sagittatus ) and various species of armhook squid (Gonatus spp.). Populations of Southern Long-finned Pilot Whales in the Southern Hemisphere appear to feed more exclusively on cephalopods. Breeding. Mating system of the Long-finned Pilot Whale is likely polygynous. Mating activity can occur throughout the year, but it is most frequent in each hemisphere’s respective spring and summer. Gestation lasts c.12 months. Birth interval of the Longfinned Pilot Whale is one of the longest among cetaceans at 3-5 years. This long span accommodates an unusually long lactation period that lasts c.3 years on average. In an offspring’s later years, lactation is less nutritionally necessary and instead likely plays an important role in reinforcing social bonds. Males reach sexual maturity later (c.12 years) than females (c.8 years). Females live almost twice as long (60 years) as males (30-45 years), and post-reproductive female longevity is common. Activity patterns. Because of their nocturnal foraging habits, the Long-finned Pilot Whale has a dive profile that alternates between deep (more than 100 m) at night and shallow (less than 16 m) during the day. Surface behavior consists mostly of resting and socializing. Resting is most common at sunrise after a night of foraging and individuals will often raft together in groups. Pairs may synchronize swimming patterns for antipredatory and social purposes. The Long-finned Pilot Whale can be somewhat aerially active, “porpoising” while traveling and spy hopping. Breaching is less common. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Long-finned Pilot Whale is highly social and will travel in groups of 20-100 individuals, although groups of more than 1000 individuals have been reported. Large groups consist of smaller social subunits of 10-20 individuals. The Long-finned Pilot Whale has also been observed in mixed-species groups with a variety of other delphinids, the Atlantic White-sided Dolphin ( Lagenorhynchus acutus ) and the Common Bottlenose Dolphin being most common. Social vocalizations of the Long-finned Pilot Whale have a mean frequency of 4480 Hz, lower than vocalizations of the Short-finned Pilot Whale at 7870 Hz. Photo-identification and genetic studies have indicated a stable, matrilineal social structure similar to that of the Killer Whale. These matrilineal units (matrilines) tend to have a slightly female-biased sex ratio and consist of a matriarch and her immediate kin. Strong natal group philopatry is exhibited by both sexes, males especially. Males will mate during temporary aggregations of separate family groups but will otherwise remain in their own matrilines for their entire lives. In the western North Atlantic Ocean, Northern Long-finned Pilot Whales show seasonal inshore—offshore movement. They move toward the edge of the continental shelf from mid-winter to early spring and toward inshore waters of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Canada, in summer and autumn. These movements have been correlated with spawning of cephalopod prey species in the region. Long-Finned Pilot Whales occur around the Faroe Islands throughout the year, with peak abundance in late summer. They are among the species most often associated with mass strandings, which are especially common at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, in October—January. This behavior is poorly understood because mass-stranded individuals usually appear physically healthy (single strandings are more often associated with pathological problems), and they may restrand themselves after being assisted off a beach. If the Long-finned Pilot Whale can attune to the earth’s magnetic field to assist in navigation, they may be driven astray by geomagnetic anomalies. Because of their strong social bonds, a group may follow a confused, diseased, or injured individual that has made a navigational mistake. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. Neither subspecies of the Long-finned Pilot Whale has been assessed, but the subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea is listed as Data Deficient. Abundance of the Long-finned Pilot Whale is ¢.200,000 individuals in Antarctic waters, c.13,000 individuals off eastern Canada, and ¢.780,000 individuals in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Overall population trend of the Long-finned Pilot Whale is unknown, but probable declines driven by a combination of threats suggest a 30% reduction in global population size over the next three generations (72 years). The most serious threats are direct and incidental catch. Stable social structure of the Long-finned Pilot Whale has made them easy to herd and ideal hunting targets. Harvesting of the Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale takes place currently off the Faroe Islands and Greenland only, but drive fisheries historically operated off Newfoundland (Canada), Cape Cod (USA), Norway, Ireland, Scotland, and the Falkland Islands. From 1947 to 1971, drive fisheries off Newfoundland killed 54,000 individuals, but this population is now thought to be recovering. There has been large-scale whaling off the Faroe Islands since the 9"" century, and annual records dating from 1584 show an average catch of 850 ind/year. Despite this catch rate, the Faroe Islands fishery is considered to be sustainable. Meat, blubber, and oil are the primary commodities. The Long-finned Pilot Whale is also vulnerable to incidental catch in other fisheries, and it seems especially susceptible to entanglement in driftnets. Effects of mortality related to incidental catch have not been quantified. In waters off the north-eastern USA, the Northern Long-finned Pilot Whale is commonly taken in mackerel, herring, and squid fisheries operating over the continental shelf break.

Males tend to be slightly larger than females. Neonates are 85-112 cm long. Similar to the Common Bottlenose Dolphin ( 1. truncatus ), the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin has robust body, moderate-length beak, and tall and slightly falcate dorsal fin. Dorsalfin, flippers, and flukes tend to be broader and larger relative to their body size than those of the Common Bottlenose Dolphin. The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin also appears more slender, with longer and thinner beak,slightly less convex melon, and head with more pointed profile. Eye region also appears to bulge out laterally. Skin pigmentation, although relatively simple, can be variable. Ventral side is generally off-white to pale gray and transitions laterally and dorsally to medium to dark gray. Dorsally, this darker gray appears as a cape that extends back onto tailstock. Pale spinal blaze may be present in some individuals and extends to below dorsalfin. Dark spotting is distinctive feature of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin, which is rarely found on the Common Bottlenose Dolphin. These prominent black spots can be found on bellies of adult Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins. They vary in intensity, which increases with age. Pigmentation around mouth line and tip of beak tends to get paler with increasing age. Young offspring are paler than adults, and spotting is absent. The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin does not have any clear sexual dimorphism. Each jaw contains 19-27 pairs of teeth.","Tropical to warm temperate waters, occasionally in cooler waters (e.g. offJapan, northern China, southern Australia, and South Africa). Sea-surface temperatures where the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is found vary greatly between regions but are generally 20-30°C. Preferred habitats of Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins appear to be near-shore, continental shelf waters and areas with sandy or rocky bottoms, coral reefs, or seagrass beds. They are most abundant in waters less than 100 m deep but can be found in waters deeper than 200 m.","Primary prey of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin tends to be benthic and reef-dwelling fish and cephalopods in continental shelf waters. They also consume some pelagic and epipelagic species. Populations in waters of oceanic islands appear to consume mostly epi- and mesopelagic fish and cephalopods, although benthic crustaceans can make up a substantial proportion of the diet. Prey species usually belong to several families, including Belonidae , Mugilidae , Sciaenidae , Engraulidae , Sepioteuthidae, Sepiidae , Sepiolidae , Loliginidae , and Octopodidae . On rare occasions, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins eat small benthic sharks. Some foraging techniques include tail slaps to flush out prey, carrying sponges (potentially to protect rostrum from rubbing against the ocean floor while foraging), and chasing prey onto beaches to catch them.","Mating activity of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin can occur throughout the year, but it is most frequent in spring and summer. Gestation lasts c.12 months. Birth interval is commonly 3-6 years. Lactation lasts 3-5 years before offspring are weaned. Female Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins that lose a neonate early can become pregnant again soon afterward and give birth the next year. Females can lactate and be pregnant at the same time. Males generally reach sexual maturity earlier (10-15 years) than females (12-15 years). Maximum life span is c.40 years, but there is some evidence from tooth growth rings that individuals can live 50 years or more.","The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is thought to dive a maximum of 200 m, and most dives last 5-10 minutes. Normal swimming speed is 1-4-4 km/h, but speeds of 16-19 km/h can be reached during high-speed bursts. Surface behavior consists mostly of traveling, milling around, feeding, resting, and socializing.","The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin usually travels in groups of 20-50 individuals, although groups of up to 2000 individuals have been reported in South Africa. Mean group size in Plettenberg Bay is thought to be 140 individuals. Group size tends to be larger when young offspring are present. Based on populations in regions that have been studied extensively, Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins tend to be year-round residents in fairly limited coastal habitats. Minimum home range is thought to be more than 200 km? with males tending to range more widely than females. Individual Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins in waters of Kyushu,Japan, have been recorded in both Oita Prefecture and Kagoshima Bay, which are hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Movement across deep oceanic waters has been reported, but it is unknown if such movements are common. The Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin has been observed in groups with a variety of other species of delphinids, including the Common Bottlenose Dolphin, the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin ( Sousa chinensis ), the Spinner Dolphin ( Stenella longirostris ), the False Killer Whale ( Pseudorca crassidens ), and common dolphins ( Delphinus spp. ). Sex ratio of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is about equal at birth, but there are more males at subadulthood and more females surviving to adulthood. Natal philopatry occurs in some regions. Social organization of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin can be best described as fission—fusion. Males can form small alliances (general 2-3 individuals) to challenge other groups of males for access to females. These groups may have long-term consistency, suggesting persistent relationships among cooperating males—an unusual social trait among mammals. Female Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins can also form cooperative groups for protection against predators, to raise young, and for avoiding male coercion.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The [IUCN Red List. Due to taxonomic uncertainty, total abundance of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin is currently unknown. Some estimates of abundance have been made in various regions of their distribution, including 520-530 individuals off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa; 136-179 individuals off Zanzibar, Tanzania; 1200 individuals in the Persian Gulf; 400 individuals in Watch-of-No-Ground, Bangladesh; 218 individuals off western Kyushu,Japan; 169 individuals off Mikura Island, Japan; ¢.50 individuals in north-eastern Philippines; 1099 individuals off Queensland, Australia; 2000-3000 individuals in Shark Bay, Australia; and less than 100 individuals off south-western Taiwan. Overall population trend is currently unknown. The most severe threats to the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin are direct and incidental catch and habitat degradation. Incidental catchesin gillnets and purse seines are of great concern throughout the distribution of the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin. In the 1980s, up to 2000 individuals were caught per year during Taiwanese shark fishery operations in Australian waters. They have also been hunted for human consumption and shark bait in the Philippines, Taiwan, and east Africa. Until large-scale drive hunts were banned in 1990, the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin was caught in the Penghu Islands, Taiwan, to supply aquaria and tourist resorts in Europe, Mexico, and Dubai. In 2003-2007, more than 100 Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins were taken from the Solomon Islands for the same purpose. Habitat degradation from expansion of coastal aquaculture operations, heavy industrialization, and coastal development reduces availability of suitable habitat for the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin. With heavy industrialization comes the threat of environmental contaminants. Other threats include disturbance by whalewatching vessels, increased offspring mortality from dolphin-feeding tours, and noise disturbance from dolphin-watching tours, pleasure boating, and commercial vessels.","Hammond et al.

Habitat degradation from expansion of coastal aquaculture operations, heavy industrialization, and coastal development reduces availability of suitable habitat for the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin. With heavy industrialization comes the threat of environmental contaminants. Other threats include disturbance by whalewatching vessels, increased offspring mortality from dolphin-feeding tours, and noise disturbance from dolphin-watching tours, pleasure boating, and commercial vessels.

Neonates are 84— 140 cm long and weigh ¢.30 kg. Although there is variation in body shape throughout the distribution of the Common Bottlenose Dolphin, it has robust, medium-sized build. Body size is perhaps related to water temperature, except in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The Common Bottlenose Dolphin has short and robust beak, with distinct crease separating it from melon. Dorsal fin is located at middle of back and is tall and moderately falcate. Flippers are recurved and slightly pointed at tips. Skin pigmentation varies from pale gray to black dorsally and laterally, with pale, and sometimes pinkish, coloration on belly. Spotting is rare but, when present, generally appears as small flecks on belly and lowersides. Pale brush marking is sometimes found on sides of Common Bottlenose Dolphins, especially on face, and sometimes there is faint spinal blaze. Wide, faint stripe can be found extending from flipper forward to gape. The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is somewhat sexually dimorphic in size, with adult males tending to be slightly larger than females. Each jaw contains 18-27 pairs offlattened teeth.","Temperate and tropical waters, typically along coasts and over continental shelves. Off coasts of North America, Common Bottlenose Dolphins generally inhabit waters with sea-surface temperatures of 10-32°C. They may also occur in bays, lagoons, channels, river mouths, and deep oceanic waters. They can be found as far south as Tierra del Fuego, South Africa, and New Zealand. In the North Pacific Ocean, Common Bottlenose Dolphin frequent waters as far north as the southern Sea of Okhotsk, Kuril Islands, and central California. In the North Atlantic Ocean, they can occur as far north as Nova Scotia, Canada, as well as Norway and the Lofoten Islands. The Common Bottlenose Dolphin generally is not found in waters pole-ward of 45° in either hemisphere, except in northern Europe and southern New Zealand.","The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is primarily a generalist feeder and eats a large variety of fish and squid. Generalist feeding is most common, but individuals may show some specialization within populations. Some preference has been shown forfish belonging to the families Sciaenidae , Scombridae , and Mugilidae . Most prey is benthic, but pelagic fish are often eaten. Noise-producing fish (i.e. sciaenids) represent a large portion of the diet, which sometimes also includes shrimps, squid, and other crustaceans. In some cases, different age and sex classes of Common Bottlenose Dolphins eat in different areas, with lactating females and their young feeding nearshore, adolescents frequenting more offshore waters, and adult males and resting females feeding even farther offshore. Common Bottlenose Dolphins exhibit variable feeding strategies, but they generally capture fish individually. Cooperative feeding (chasing fish onto shore to trap them and feeding from shrimp trawlers) is not uncommon. Individual feeding strategies vary greatly and include high-speed chases, knocking fish out of the water with flukes, producing bubbles to herd prey toward the water's surface, and stunning fish with percussive leaps and tail lobs (“kerplunking”).","Mating activity and births of Common Bottlenose Dolphins can occur throughout the year. Breeding, however, is most frequent during spring and summer. Captive studies have shown that females ovulate spontaneously and multiple times within one season. Mature males can be sexually active throughout the year. Gestation lasts c.12 months. Birth intervals are typically ¢.3-6 years. Occasionally, female Common Bottlenose Dolphins are pregnant and lactating at the same time. Lactation can lasts 1-5-2 years. Males reach sexual maturity later (9-14 years) than females (5-14 years). Females as old as 48 years have produced offspring, and genetic studies have matched paternity of progenyto males that were 13-40 years old. Common Bottlenose Dolphins canlive up to 58 years, but most often, femaleslive to ¢.50 years and males live to 40-45 years.","Common Bottlenose Dolphins are active throughout the day and night. Common behaviors include traveling, feeding, resting, and socializing. They can be aerially active and bow-ride. Populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphins living in deep waters can dive for at least five minutes to depths of more than 500 m in pursuit of prey. Populations inhabiting shallow water do not dive for as long and generally surface every 30 seconds.","Groups of Common Bottlenose Dolphins most often consist of 2-15 individuals, although groups of more than 1000 individuals have been reported. Group structure varies greatly with factors such as sex, age, reproductive status, and kinship. Relationships between mothers and their young are very strong, but other affiliations may or may not be stable over time. Common subgroups consist of nursery groups, juveniles of mixed sex, strongly bonded pairs, and individual adult males. Common Bottlenose Dolphins occur in mixed-species groups with a variety of other delphinid species, often including the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin (7. aduncus ), the Atlantic Spotted Dolphin ( Stenella frontalis ), the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin ( Sousa chinensis ), and the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin ( Sousa teuszii ). Echolocation vocalizations of Common Bottlenose Dolphins have a peak frequency of 40-130 Hz. Movements and home ranges of the Common Bottlenose Dolphin vary greatly throughout its distribution. Most inshore individuals are not migratory and reside long-term in a particular area; some retain multigenerational home ranges. Some coastal populations residing in the cold-water extremes of the species’ distribution may migrate seasonally. Average daily movements of Common Bottlenose Dolphins are 33-89 km, but offshore dolphins may travel as far as 4200 km.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List.

Population trends of Common Bottlenose Dolphins are unknown. The Fiordland (New Zealand) subpopulation is estimated to contain ¢.205 individuals. The population size of the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin is unknown, but it is thought to be at least several thousand, and there is uncertainty as to the population trend. Threats of most concern are direct and incidental catch. Direct takes of the Common Bottlenose Dolphin often occur for display, research, and use by the military. Public display of the Common Bottlenose Dolphin started in 1883 at the Brighton Aquarium in the UK. In the past, they were deliberately hunted in the Black Sea for human consumption, oil, and leather. Human consumption of the Common Bottlenose Dolphin still occurs offJapan, Peru, Sri Lanka, and the Faroe Islands. They are known to regularly feed from fishing gear making incidental entanglement and ingestion of fishing gear a serious threat to the species. Gillnets, trawls, purse seines,driftnets, and hook-and-line fishing gear can cause mortality. Populations of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal waters where pollution is prevalent are at high risk of immunotoxicity, pathological problems, and reproductive impairment from contaminants, including PCBs, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and DDT metabolites. Other threats include noise disturbance from military sonar and seismic surveying, ship strikes, biotoxins, and habitat destruction.","Barros & Odell (1990) | Barros & Wells (1998) | Bearzi et al.

The Rough-toothed Dolphin appears to be vagrant in the Mediterranean Sea. Its overall distribution is not well known, and it does not appear to be particularly abundant anywhere. Around the Hawaiian Islands, the Rough-toothed Dolphin is most often observed in waters more than 1500 m deep and in areas with upwelling. In French Polynesia, they are common in waters 1000-2000 m deep and within 1-:8-5-5 km of barrier reef habitat. Deepest recorded dives of Rough-toothed Dolphins are ¢.70 m, but they appear to be morphologically capable of deeper dives. Average dives last 15 minutes.","The Rough-toothed Dolphin feeds on cephalopods and fish, including large species such as mahi mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). They may hunt cooperatively to take down these larger fish. Echolocation clicks tend to consist of short pulses at low frequencies, which are likely ideal for deeper foraging.","There is no specific information for this species, but male Rough-toothed Dolphins are thought to reach sexual maturity at c.14 years and females at c.10 years, and longevity is thought to be 32-36 years.","The Rough-toothed Dolphin is a moderately paced swimmer and makes low-angled, arced leaps. Movements and dives of groups are often synchronized while traveling when group formation tends to be tight. Rough-toothed Dolphins may occasionally bow-ride alongside fast vessels and are aerially active; they occasionally breach.","Group sizes of 10-20 Rough-toothed Dolphins are most common, but groups of up to 50 individuals have been reported in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the central Atlantic Ocean. Aerial surveys have observed groups of more than 300 individuals, although these larger groups may be aggregations of subgroups. Preliminary work on social structure of the Rough-toothed Dolphin suggests more stable association patterns than are typical of most species of delphinids. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, Rough-toothed Dolphins associate with pilot whales ( Globicephala spp. ) and Fraser’s Dolphins ( Lagenodelphis hoser ). Site fidelity seems to be high in Hawaiian waters. The longest reported linear distance traveled was 480 km among the Hawaiian Islands. Little data have been collected on migrations and movement patterns of the Rough-toothed Dolphin, especially from more offshore populations, so data from the Hawaiian populations may not be representative.","CITES Appendix II.

Population trends are currently unknown, but total abundance is likely more than 150,000 individuals. The Rough-toothed Dolphin is widespread, and there are no known major threats or reports of population declines. Rough-toothed Dolphins are not direct targets of any fisheries. They may be taken occasionally in Japanese drive fisheries (in 1976-1981, only 23 Rough-toothed Dolphins were taken in fisheries from Okinawa) and in drives off the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. They are harpooned opportunistically offJapan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and West Africa. Off Taiwan, they are occasionally caught in gillnets, driftnets, and pelagic long lines. Rough-toothed Dolphins are only rarely caught incidentally in tuna purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Only 21 individuals were taken in these fisheries in 1971-1975. They are also incidentally caught in gillnet and driftnet fisheries from Sri Lanka, Brazil, and likely in other tropical island areas.

Aerial surveys have observed groups of more than 300 individuals, although these larger groups may be aggregations of subgroups. Preliminary work on social structure of the Rough-toothed Dolphin suggests more stable association patterns than are typical of most species of delphinids. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, Rough-toothed Dolphins associate with pilot whales ( Globicephala spp. ) and Fraser’s Dolphins ( Lagenodelphis hoser ). Site fidelity seems to be high in Hawaiian waters. The longest reported linear distance traveled was 480 km among the Hawaiian Islands. Little data have been collected on migrations and movement patterns of the Rough-toothed Dolphin, especially from more offshore populations, so data from the Hawaiian populations may not be representative. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. There are ¢.145,900 Rough-toothed Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, 2746 individuals in the northern Gulfof Mexico, and 19,904 individuals around Hawaii. Population trends are currently unknown, but total abundance is likely more than 150,000 individuals. The Rough-toothed Dolphin is widespread, and there are no known major threats or reports of population declines. Rough-toothed Dolphins are not direct targets of any fisheries. They may be taken occasionally in Japanese drive fisheries (in 1976-1981, only 23 Rough-toothed Dolphins were taken in fisheries from Okinawa) and in drives off the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. They are harpooned opportunistically offJapan, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and West Africa. Off Taiwan, they are occasionally caught in gillnets, driftnets, and pelagic long lines. Rough-toothed Dolphins are only rarely caught incidentally in tuna purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Only 21 individuals were taken in these fisheries in 1971-1975. They are also incidentally caught in gillnet and driftnet fisheries from Sri Lanka, Brazil, and likely in other tropical island areas. Organochlorine contamination may be an issue off Guangdong, China, where high tissue concentrations of PCBs have been reported in the Rough-toothed Dolphin. Bibliography. Baird, Webster et al.

S. l. roserventris Dumont d’Urville in Schreber, Goldfuss & Wagner, 1846 — shallow, nearshore waters of SE Asia, Sunda Is, Wallacea, New Guinea, and Australia.","Total length 129-280 cm (males) and 138-211 cm (females); weight up to 80 kg (males) and up to 63 kg (females). Neonates are 50-80 cm long and weigh 5-10 kg. Generally, “Gray’s Spinner Dolphin” ( S. I. longirostris ) and the “Central American Spinner Dolphin” (S. L centroamericana) are heavier and longer than the “Eastern Spinner Dolphin” (S. L orientalis). The “Dwarf Spinner Dolphin” (S. I. rosetventris) is smallest subspecies, as the name implies. The Spinner Dolphin has slender build; very long, thin beak; and slender curved flippers. Depending on subspecies and sex, moderately sized dorsal fins vary from falcate to triangular, with males tending to have more triangular dorsal fins. In the Eastern Spinner Dolphin, dorsal fin may be recurved, giving a look of backward placement—especially prominent in older males. Older males also have post-anal protrusion or keel, which is particularly sexually dimorphic in the Eastern Spinner Dolphin and the Central American Spinner Dolphin, but less so in Gray’s Spinner Dolphin. Adult male Eastern Spinner Dolphins and Central American Spinner Dolphins may also have upturned fluke tips. Beak tips and lips are dark gray, and bodyis three-toned, comprising a dark-gray dorsal cape, paler gray flanks, and white (pink-tinged) belly, throat, and lower jaw. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin and the Central American Spinner Dolphin are not three-toned but instead are monotone dark gray, with white patches around urogenital area and in “armpit” areas. There is also usually dark strip extending from eye posteroventrally to flipper joint. Another form, called the white-belly Spinner Dolphin, seems to be a hybrid between Gray’s Spinner Dolphin and the Eastern Spinner Dolphin. It is characterized by more robust build and two-tone color pattern, but sexual dimorphism is not as exaggerated as it is in the Eastern Spinner Dolphin. There may be other, more subtle morphological differences among populations. Neonates have more muted color patterns that are otherwise similar to adult patterns. There are 40-60 pairs of small, conical teeth in each jaw, except the Dwarf Spinner Dolphin has only 40-52 teeth in each jaw.","Inshore waters ofislands and banks in tropical areas. In Hawaii, Spinner Dolphins are known to use shallow bays for resting during the day. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, they prefer warm pools on high seas. These are warm water masses characterized by a shallow mixed layer overlying a thermocline, high sea-surface temperatures that vary little throughout the year, and high primary productivity. The Dwarf Spinner Dolphin prefers shallow coral reefs, and the white-belly form prefers habitat similar to the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin (S. attenuata ).","The Spinner Dolphin is primarily a nocturnal forager and generally feeds on small fish (less than 20 cm) and cephalopods. The Dwarf Spinner Dolphin feeds during the day on reef species such as benthic fish and invertebrates. Off Hawaii, the Spinner Dolphin forages cooperatively by herding schooling fish into large donutshaped balls close to the surface; then individuals take turns swimming through the donut and picking out prey. Foraging dives may descend to 200-300 m, and sometimes even up to 600 m. Natural predators include the Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ) and possibly the False Killer Whale ( Pseudorca crassidens ), the Pygmy Killer Whale ( Peponocephala electra ), and the Short-finned Pilot Whale ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ).","Breeding of the Spinner Dolphin may peak from late spring to autumn, depending on population and geographical location. Gestation is ¢.10 months, and offspring are nursed for 1-2 years. Females reach sexual maturity at 4-7 years and males at 7-10 years. Breeding females give birth roughly once every three years. Longevity is thought to be ¢.26 years. Subspecies with stronger sexual dimorphism likely have a polygynous mating system based on male-male competition. In contrast, the other subspecies and the white-belly form have larger testes and so are likely more polygynandrous and more dependent on sperm competition.","Pelagic groups of Spinner Dolphins may travel more than 50 km/ day. In Hawaii, they stay in bays during early morning and afternoon to rest in a location safe from predators and then move offshore ¢.400 m for night-time foraging. The Spinner Dolphin is famously known forits highly acrobatic leaps, which often involve spinning on the longitudinal axis up to seven times. Spinning is thought to be a useful technique for generating enough force on water reentry to dislodge attached remoras. It is also possible that the bubble plume created on reentry acts as a distinct acoustic target for communication purposes. The Spinner Dolphin is also known to bow-ride, except in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, where it avoids purse-seine vessels.","In French Polynesia, groups of Spinner Dolphins consist of a few dozen to more than 100 individuals, but groups of more than 1000 individuals have been documented. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, Spinner Dolphins travel in large mixed-species groups with the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin and yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares). Interactions with Pantropical Spotted Dolphins include traveling, aggression, and sexual activity. Social structure of the Spinner Dolphin appears, at least in some cases, to be based on family units with more fluid associations among unrelated individuals. In this fission—fusion structure, large groups will often break apart and reform with different subgroup memberships throughout the day and for different activities. A population of Spinner Dolphins off the south-eastern Hawaiian Archipelago seems to be structured this way. This contrasts with another population in the north-western part of the Archipelago that is characterized by highly stable, long-term associations. These more stable associations have been linked to greater gene flow and may be influenced by habitat and resource variability throughout the Archipelago. This population appears to be isolated from other populations of Spinner Dolphins in the Pacific Ocean and demonstrates that there can be variable genetic and social structures even between closely related populations. In offshore waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, there is some evidence of segregation by sex and age classes. Movements of Spinner Dolphins may be associated with warm-water currents, such as the Kuroshiro Current offJapan. Site fidelity of Spinner Dolphins is high off Hawaii and in French Polynesia.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin is listed as Vulnerable, and the Central American Spinner Dolphin and the Dwarf Spinner Dolphin have not been assessed. There are ¢.801,000 Spinner Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin has been impacted tuna purse-seine fisheries in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and currently numbers ¢.613,000 individuals;it is recovering only at a growth rate of 1-1% /year. There are 11,971 Spinner Dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico and 3351 individuals in Hawaiian waters. There are currently no abundance estimates for the Dwarf Spinner Dolphin. In the Philippines and Malaysia, there are ¢.35,000 Spinner Dolphins. Many regions in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans have not yet been surveyed, but known abundances add up to more than 1,000,000 individuals overall. Gray’s Spinner Dolphin is likely composed of several distinct populations; genetics has revealed limited gene flow among neighboring island communities in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, and even among the Hawaiian Islands gene flow is limited. The Spinner Dolphin is susceptible to tuna purse-seine fisheries in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin is estimated to have been depleted by c.65% since 1959 as a result of kills in this fishery. Mortality has been greatly reduced since the introduction of mortality limits by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, but the Eastern Spinner Dolphin appears to be recovering very slowly. Stress from continued fisheries encounters and mortality due to offspring separation or orphaning may be having long-term negative effects on the population. Spinner Dolphins also are taken incidentally in gillnet, trawl, and purse-seine fisheries throughout their distribution. They are the most abundant delphinid in the Indian Ocean, and annual takes in fisheries number in the hundreds per year off India and up to several thousand per year off Sri Lanka. Catch rates are unknown in other areas, including the Atlantic Ocean, especially in fisheries operating off West Africa. Incidental catches off the Philippines and Venezuela are used for shark bait and human consumption. The Spinner Dolphin is intentionally caught for these purposes in the Caribbean and off Sri Lanka, Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan. The Spinner Dolphin is also vulnerable to shrimp trawlers in the Gulf of Thailand. Spinner Dolphins rest in shallow bays during the day in some areas off Brazil, Hawaii, Bali, and Indonesia, and they may be increasingly susceptible to harassment from growing dolphin-watching activity.","Andrews et al.

The Eastern Spinner Dolphin and the Central American Spinner Dolphin are not three-toned but instead are monotone dark gray, with white patches around urogenital area and in “armpit” areas. There is also usually dark strip extending from eye posteroventrally to flipper joint. Another form, called the white-belly Spinner Dolphin, seems to be a hybrid between Gray’s Spinner Dolphin and the Eastern Spinner Dolphin. It is characterized by more robust build and two-tone color pattern, but sexual dimorphism is not as exaggerated as it is in the Eastern Spinner Dolphin. There may be other, more subtle morphological differences among populations. Neonates have more muted color patterns that are otherwise similar to adult patterns. There are 40-60 pairs of small, conical teeth in each jaw, except the Dwarf Spinner Dolphin has only 40-52 teeth in each jaw. Habitat. Inshore waters ofislands and banks in tropical areas. In Hawaii, Spinner Dolphins are known to use shallow bays for resting during the day. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, they prefer warm pools on high seas. These are warm water masses characterized by a shallow mixed layer overlying a thermocline, high sea-surface temperatures that vary little throughout the year, and high primary productivity. The Dwarf Spinner Dolphin prefers shallow coral reefs, and the white-belly form prefers habitat similar to the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin (S. attenuata ). Food and Feeding. The Spinner Dolphin is primarily a nocturnal forager and generally feeds on small fish (less than 20 cm) and cephalopods. The Dwarf Spinner Dolphin feeds during the day on reef species such as benthic fish and invertebrates. Off Hawaii, the Spinner Dolphin forages cooperatively by herding schooling fish into large donutshaped balls close to the surface; then individuals take turns swimming through the donut and picking out prey. Foraging dives may descend to 200-300 m, and sometimes even up to 600 m. Natural predators include the Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ) and possibly the False Killer Whale ( Pseudorca crassidens ), the Pygmy Killer Whale ( Peponocephala electra ), and the Short-finned Pilot Whale ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ). Breeding. Breeding of the Spinner Dolphin may peak from late spring to autumn, depending on population and geographical location. Gestation is ¢.10 months, and offspring are nursed for 1-2 years. Females reach sexual maturity at 4-7 years and males at 7-10 years. Breeding females give birth roughly once every three years. Longevity is thought to be ¢.26 years. Subspecies with stronger sexual dimorphism likely have a polygynous mating system based on male-male competition. In contrast, the other subspecies and the white-belly form have larger testes and so are likely more polygynandrous and more dependent on sperm competition. Activity patterns. Pelagic groups of Spinner Dolphins may travel more than 50 km/ day. In Hawaii, they stay in bays during early morning and afternoon to rest in a location safe from predators and then move offshore ¢.400 m for night-time foraging. The Spinner Dolphin is famously known forits highly acrobatic leaps, which often involve spinning on the longitudinal axis up to seven times. Spinning is thought to be a useful technique for generating enough force on water reentry to dislodge attached remoras. It is also possible that the bubble plume created on reentry acts as a distinct acoustic target for communication purposes. The Spinner Dolphin is also known to bow-ride, except in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, where it avoids purse-seine vessels. Movements, Home range and Social organization. In French Polynesia, groups of Spinner Dolphins consist of a few dozen to more than 100 individuals, but groups of more than 1000 individuals have been documented. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, Spinner Dolphins travel in large mixed-species groups with the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin and yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares). Interactions with Pantropical Spotted Dolphins include traveling, aggression, and sexual activity. Social structure of the Spinner Dolphin appears, at least in some cases, to be based on family units with more fluid associations among unrelated individuals. In this fission—fusion structure, large groups will often break apart and reform with different subgroup memberships throughout the day and for different activities. A population of Spinner Dolphins off the south-eastern Hawaiian Archipelago seems to be structured this way. This contrasts with another population in the north-western part of the Archipelago that is characterized by highly stable, long-term associations. These more stable associations have been linked to greater gene flow and may be influenced by habitat and resource variability throughout the Archipelago. This population appears to be isolated from other populations of Spinner Dolphins in the Pacific Ocean and demonstrates that there can be variable genetic and social structures even between closely related populations. In offshore waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean, there is some evidence of segregation by sex and age classes. Movements of Spinner Dolphins may be associated with warm-water currents, such as the Kuroshiro Current offJapan. Site fidelity of Spinner Dolphins is high off Hawaii and in French Polynesia. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin is listed as Vulnerable, and the Central American Spinner Dolphin and the Dwarf Spinner Dolphin have not been assessed. There are ¢.801,000 Spinner Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin has been impacted tuna purse-seine fisheries in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and currently numbers ¢.613,000 individuals;it is recovering only at a growth rate of 1-1% /year. There are 11,971 Spinner Dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico and 3351 individuals in Hawaiian waters. There are currently no abundance estimates for the Dwarf Spinner Dolphin. In the Philippines and Malaysia, there are ¢.35,000 Spinner Dolphins. Many regions in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans have not yet been surveyed, but known abundances add up to more than 1,000,000 individuals overall. Gray’s Spinner Dolphin is likely composed of several distinct populations; genetics has revealed limited gene flow among neighboring island communities in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, and even among the Hawaiian Islands gene flow is limited. The Spinner Dolphin is susceptible to tuna purse-seine fisheries in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Eastern Spinner Dolphin is estimated to have been depleted by c.65% since 1959 as a result of kills in this fishery. Mortality has been greatly reduced since the introduction of mortality limits by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, but the Eastern Spinner Dolphin appears to be recovering very slowly. Stress from continued fisheries encounters and mortality due to offspring separation or orphaning may be having long-term negative effects on the population. Spinner Dolphins also are taken incidentally in gillnet, trawl, and purse-seine fisheries throughout their distribution. They are the most abundant delphinid in the Indian Ocean, and annual takes in fisheries number in the hundreds per year off India and up to several thousand per year off Sri Lanka. Catch rates are unknown in other areas, including the Atlantic Ocean, especially in fisheries operating off West Africa. Incidental catches off the Philippines and Venezuela are used for shark bait and human consumption. The Spinner Dolphin is intentionally caught for these purposes in the Caribbean and off Sri Lanka, Philippines, Indonesia, and Taiwan. The Spinner Dolphin is also vulnerable to shrimp trawlers in the Gulf of Thailand. Spinner Dolphins rest in shallow bays during the day in some areas off Brazil, Hawaii, Bali, and Indonesia, and they may be increasingly susceptible to harassment from growing dolphin-watching activity.

The Striped Dolphin is more robust in build than other species of Stenella . It has moderately long beak that is distinguished from melon by crease; a moderately sized, falcate dorsal fin; and slender, curved, darkgray flippers with tapered and pointed tips. Skin has a three-toned color pattern, with dark bluish-gray dorsal cape, pale-gray flanks, and ventral surface (including throat and lowerjaw) that is whitish-pink up to urogenital area. Pale-gray streak extends from anterior flanks posterodorsally into cape just under dorsal fin. Beak is mostly black, and stripe extends from beak to black ring around eye. From there, stripe continues down to leading edge offlipperjoint. Thin, black band borders white ventral area, and accessory stripe may streak from this border onto white area just above flipper. There are 40-55 slender, conical teeth in each jaw. Striped Dolphins in the south-western Mediterranean Sea tend to be slightly shorter than the species’ average.","Prefers deep water and is only found near-shore where deep water occurs near the coast. Striped Dolphins are associated with areas of upwelling in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the Kuroshio Current offJapan. In the western North Atlantic Ocean, they prefer waters to continental slopes. Oceanic populations of Striped Dolphins off South Africa are most abundant in the warm Agulhas Current in waters more than 1000 m deep. Along the mid-Atlantic ridge, they prefer warm sea-surface temperatures of 12-22°C. In the Mediterranean Sea, Striped Dolphins prefer waters with depths of at least 600 m.","The Striped Dolphin is known to forage at depths of 200-700 m. Off Japan and South Africa, lanternfish (myctophids) are preferred prey. Cephalopods dominate the diet in the Mediterranean Sea; preferred species include Albraliopsis morisii, common clubhook squid ( Onychoteuthis banksii), European flying squid ( Todarodes sagittatus), common arm squid (Brachioteuthis riser), eye-flash squid (Abralia veranyi), and odd bobtail ( Heteroteuthis dispar). In the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean, Striped Dolphins feed on mesopelagic squid and cephalopods. In the coastal northeastern Atlantic Ocean, dominant prey are cod ( Gadidae ) and anchovy ( Engraulidae ). Foraging of the Striped Dolphin is likely nocturnal.","The Striped Dolphin may breed throughout the year, but offJapan, breeding is known to peak in summer and winter. Gestation lasts 12-13 months. Males reach sexual maturity at 7-15 years and females at 5-13 years. Breeding system of the Striped Dolphin is thought to be polygynous. Longevity is thought to be ¢.58 years.","Off the French Riviera in the Mediterranean Sea, there are known diurnal inshore-offshore movements of Striped Dolphins. They feed close to the continental shelf at night and move offshore during the day. They are fast swimmers and skittish around boats. Acrobatic leaps are common and include a unique behavior known as “roto-tailing,” which involves rotating the tail during a high breach.","Off Japan, average group size is c.100 individuals, and groups usually consist of less than 500 individuals. In the eastern North Atlantic Ocean, groups of 10-30 individuals are common. In the western Pacific Ocean, groups are segregated by sex and age classes. There are three types of groups: juvenile groups, adult groups, and mixed (breeding and non-breeding) groups. Young offspring join juvenile groups c.1-2 years after weaning. Striped Dolphins move seasonally with oceanic currents. Off Japan, they move north into pelagic waters with the Kuroshio Current during summer and come back south again along the coast and down into the East China Sea during winter. In the Mediterranean Sea, Striped Dolphins move north in May—September to avoid increasing sea-surface temperatures farther south. They become more abundant between the French mainland and Corsica during this time. Abundance then decreases again in December—April.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The subpopulation in the Mediterranean Sea is listed as Vulnerable. Total abundance of Striped Dolphins in the western North Pacific Ocean is ¢.570,000 individuals, including 19,631 individuals off near-shore Japan. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, there are 1,470,854 Striped Dolphins. There are ¢.19,000 individuals off the west coast of the USA, 94,462 individuals off the east coast of the USA, 13,143 individuals off Hawaii, ¢.74,000 individuals in the Bay of Biscay, 3325 in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and 68,379-214,800 individuals in the western Mediterranean Sea. The Striped Dolphin is, in fact, one of the most abundant species of cetaceans in the Mediterranean Sea. Morphology and genetics suggest demographic isolation between Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern North Atlantic Ocean due to limited gene flow across the Strait of Gibraltar. Overall abundance of Striped Dolphins is estimated at 2,000,000 individuals, but population trends are unknown. Direct catch of Striped Dolphins has occurred offJapan since at least the late 1800s in a combination of drive fisheries and hand harpoon fisheries. In the late 1970s, catch rate was 15,000-20,000 Striped Dolphins/year, and in the 1980s and 1990s, catch rate ranged from a few hundred to several thousand dolphins per year. In 1993, an annual quota was set at 725 individuals. Nevertheless, this catch is from more than one population and is not currently thought to be a significant threat. Opportunistic catch occurs off Taiwan, in the Solomon Islands drive fishery, and in harpoon and gillnet fisheries off Sri Lanka and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Small numbers of Striped Dolphins are taken for baiting shrimp traps and human consumption in the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, France, and Italy). The Striped Dolphin is caught incidentally in purse-seine and gillnetfisheries throughout its distribution. High-sea driftnets likely killed many thousands of Striped Dolphins in the 1970s and 1980s before the United Nations introduced a moratorium on high-sea driftnet fishing in 1993. Pelagic driftnets in the western Mediterranean Sea continue to be illegally used by Moroccan, French, Italian, and Turkish fisheries. For example, the Italian fishery kills 5000-15,000 dolphins/year, mostly Striped Dolphins. The Striped Dolphin also is caught incidentally in pelagic trawl and driftnet fisheries off Western Europe. Heavy metal tissue concentrations, including selenium, exceed detrimental thresholds for mammals in the Mediterranean Sea. Tissue concentrations of PCBs and DDT are also much higher than thresholds known to cause reproductive impairment in bottlenose dolphins (7 Tursiops spp. ), although these levels have been declining gradually overthe last 20 years. These contaminants may have contributed to decreased immune function and increased susceptibility to the 1990-92 morbillivirus outbreak in the population of Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea, and possibly also the 2006-2007 outbreak. High concentrations of heavy metals and organochlorines have also been reported in specimens from Japan. Prey species of Striped Dolphins are being overexploited in the Mediterranean Sea. Even though the Striped Dolphin is classified as Least Concern, populations offJapan and in the Mediterranean Sea are experiencing significant threats.","Aguilar (2000) | Aguilar & Borrell (1994, 2005) | Bilandzic et al.

Southern limit is ¢.30° S in the western Atlantic Ocean and c.7° Sin the eastern Atlantic Ocean.,"Little is known about the diet and preferred prey of the Clymene Dolphin. It appears to be primarily a nocturnal feeder, which is supported by analyses of stomach contents that contain small mesopelagic fish and squid species that are known to be associated with the deep scattering layer. These prey include lanternfish (myctophids), herring smelts (argentinids), and codlets (bregmacerotids). The Clymene Dolphin herds schools of fish by hunting cooperatively during the day in the Gulf of Mexico. This suggests that it has an opportunistic diet that varies geographically and by prey availability.","There is no specific information available for this species, but life history parameters are thought to be similar to other species of Stenella . Female Clymene Dolphins may reach maturity at a length of 180 cm.","The Clymene Dolphin is aerially active and is known to spin on its long axis like the Spinner Dolphin, although with fewer revolutions perjump and less elaborate acrobatics. They are also known to bow-ride.","The Clymene Dolphin generally lives in small groups consisting of one to several tens of individuals. Average group size is ¢.70 individuals, but groups of up to 1000 individuals have been observed.

Sex and age classes may segregate within groups, and adult males tend not to travel in groups with mother—offspring pairs. The Clymene Dolphin is often observed in groups or in close association with Spinner Dolphins. They are also observed in groups with Short-beaked Common Dolphins ( Delphinus delphis ) oft western Africa. There are no known migratory patterns of Clymene Dolphins, and there are currently no robust data on movements or home range patterns.","CITES Appendix II.

The Clymene Dolphin is occasionally taken as direct catch in dolphin harpoon fisheries in the Caribbean (e.g. St. Vincent and the Grenadines), and incidental captures occur occasionally throughout most ofits distribution. Off Brazil and Venezuela, the Clymene Dolphin is susceptible to gillnet fisheries. Incidentally caught corpses are used for shark bait and human consumption. There is no conclusive evidence on whether any of these catches are actually intentional. Overall, exploitation does not appear to be a major threat to the Clymene Dolphin.

Clymene Dolphin Stenella clymene French: Dauphin clymene / German: Clymene-Delfin / Spanish: Delfin climene Other common names: Atlantic Spinner Dolphin , Helmet Dolphin , Senegal Dolphin , Short-snouted Spinner Dolphin Taxonomy. Delphinus clymene Gray, 1850 , type locality unknown. Taxonomy of Stenella is currently in dispute. The genus is likely polyphyletic and probably will be revised in the near future. According to molecular studies, S. frontalis is most closely related to S. coeruleoalba and S. clymene , followed by Delphinus and Tursiops aduncus . These species appear to be more closely related to each other than any of them are to 1. truncatus , S. attenuata or S. longirostris . Monotypic. On following pages: 19. Striped Dolphin ( Stenella coeruleoalba ); 20. Atlantic Spotted Dolphin ( Stenella frontalis ); 21. Spinner Dolphin ( Stenella longirostris ); 22. Rough-toothed Dolphin ( Steno bredanensis ). Distribution. Tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. Descriptive notes. Total length up to 197 cm (males) and up to 190 cm (females); weight up to 90 kg. Neonatal length is unknown but thought to be less than 120 cm. The Clymene Dolphin has similar color pattern to the Spinner Dolphin ( S. longirostris ), but it is smaller in size and more robust in build. Clymene Dolphins have moderately sized, falcate dorsal fin and slender, curved flippers. Color pattern is three-toned and comprises a dark-gray dorsal cape, pale-gray flanks, and white-pink belly, throat, and lower jaw. Dorsal cape dips above eye to cover most of melon, and dips again at mid-body below dorsal fin. Lips and beak tip are black or dark gray. There is dark stripe extending longitudinally from beak tip to base of melon, and there are dark streaks running across beak like a moustache. Dark ring encircles eye, and dark band from corner of eye extends posteroventrally to leading edge of flipper joint. There are 39-52 pairs of conical teeth in each upper jaw and 39-48 pairs in lower jaw. Habitat. Prefers deeper offshore waters with an average depth of 1870 m. The Clymene Dolphin has different distributional extensions on each side of the Atlantic Ocean. Northern limit is ¢.39° N in the western Atlantic Ocean and c.16° N in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Southern limit is ¢.30° S in the western Atlantic Ocean and c.7° Sin the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Food and Feeding. Little is known about the diet and preferred prey of the Clymene Dolphin. It appears to be primarily a nocturnal feeder, which is supported by analyses of stomach contents that contain small mesopelagic fish and squid species that are known to be associated with the deep scattering layer. These prey include lanternfish (myctophids), herring smelts (argentinids), and codlets (bregmacerotids). The Clymene Dolphin herds schools of fish by hunting cooperatively during the day in the Gulf of Mexico. This suggests that it has an opportunistic diet that varies geographically and by prey availability. Breeding. There is no specific information available for this species, but life history parameters are thought to be similar to other species of Stenella . Female Clymene Dolphins may reach maturity at a length of 180 cm. Activity patterns. The Clymene Dolphin is aerially active and is known to spin on its long axis like the Spinner Dolphin, although with fewer revolutions perjump and less elaborate acrobatics. They are also known to bow-ride. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Clymene Dolphin generally lives in small groups consisting of one to several tens of individuals. Average group size is ¢.70 individuals, but groups of up to 1000 individuals have been observed. In the Gulf of Mexico, group sizes are usually less than 200 individuals, and the largest groups tend to have 60-80 individuals. Sex and age classes may segregate within groups, and adult males tend not to travel in groups with mother—offspring pairs. The Clymene Dolphin is often observed in groups or in close association with Spinner Dolphins. They are also observed in groups with Short-beaked Common Dolphins ( Delphinus delphis ) oft western Africa. There are no known migratory patterns of Clymene Dolphins, and there are currently no robust data on movements or home range patterns. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix II. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, there are ¢.6575 individuals, and off the east coast of the USA, there are ¢.6086 individuals. There are no estimates for total abundance or population trends. The Clymene Dolphin is occasionally taken as direct catch in dolphin harpoon fisheries in the Caribbean (e.g. St. Vincent and the Grenadines), and incidental captures occur occasionally throughout most ofits distribution. Off Brazil and Venezuela, the Clymene Dolphin is susceptible to gillnet fisheries. Incidentally caught corpses are used for shark bait and human consumption. There is no conclusive evidence on whether any of these catches are actually intentional. Overall, exploitation does not appear to be a major threat to the Clymene Dolphin. Several species of ocean dolphins, including the Clymene Dolphin, may be taken in large numbers in tuna purse-seine fisheries off western Africa, but there is currently no monitoring there.

Neonates are 80-85 cm long and weigh c.10-15 kg. The “Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin” (S. a. graffmani) tends to be slightly larger in size than the “Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphin” (S. a. attenuata ). Overall, the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin has slender body shape, but the Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin tends to be more robust. Beak is long and skinny, but it is slightly thicker in the Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin. Dorsal fin is moderately sized, narrow, and falcate with pointed tip. Flippers are slender and curved, also with pointed tips. Adult males may have slight anal protuberance. The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin has countershaded color pattern underlying numerous white spots. Skin is pale gray except for a dark-gray dorsal cape that sweeps low over flanks. Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphins have varying degrees of spotting, and some adults may have very little to none at all. Spotting is generally heaviest in Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin, sometimes obscuring cape entirely. Lips and beak tip are usually white. There are a few dark gray stripes on face and head: “mask” stripe across front of melon above beak between two dark rings around eyes, and stripe extending from anterior base of flipper to corner of mouth and onto lower jaw. Youngest individuals do not have spots, and areas that are pale gray on adults are white on young. As they grow, white areas darken to pale gray, and dark spots develop first on ventral body, followed by white spots on flanks and back. As individuals age, dark ventral spots may fuse and fade, leaving only white flank and dorsal spots. There are 34-48 pairs of slender, conical teeth in each jaw.","Offshore and around oceanic islands. The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is the most abundant delphinid species in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphin tends to be more abundant around the Hawaiian Islands, some Caribbean islands, Philippines, and Taiwan. In these regions, they may be observed in shallower waters. Overall, the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is more abundant in lower latitudes of its distribution. Offshore populations prefer tropical surface water characterized by a shallow thermocline (less than 50 m deep), sea-surface temperatures more than 25°C, and salinity less than 34 ppt. In the south-western Atlantic Ocean, the Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is found beyond the continental shelf in waters more than 850 m deep, and in the Gulf of Mexico, they are found in continental slope waters more than 1000 m deep.","The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is known to feed on small epipelagic fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. It is an opportunistic feeder whose diet varies by season and geographical region. The Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphin seems to prefer lanternfish ( Myctophidae ), flying squid ( Ommastrephidae ), and flying fish ( Exocoetidae ). They forage nocturnally and exploit the rising deep scattering layer. Around the Hawaiian Islands, nocturnal foraging activity is characterized by deeper dives than those observed during the day. At night, average dive is 57 m, but it is only 12:8 m during the day. Off Taiwan, diet of the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is known to include some mesopelagic species. The Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin seems to specialize more on larger benthic species. Natural predators may include the Killer Whale ( Orcinus orca ), the False Killer Whale ( Pseudorca crassidens ), the Pygmy Killer Whale (Melon-headed Whale), and the Short-finned Pilot Whale ( Globicephala macrorhynchus ). The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin associates with yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares) in the north-eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which may be related to foraging efficiency.","The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin may breed throughout the year, but breeding peaks in spring and autumn. Gestation lasts c¢.11-5 months, and young are weaned at 1-2 years of age. Breeding females will typically give birth once every 2-3 years. Females reach sexual maturity at 9-11 years of age, and males at 12-15 years.","The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is a fast swimmer (sprint swims may exceed 22 km/h), and itis known to be aerially active. Breaching and side slapping are common, particularly among juveniles. Pantropical Spotted Dolphins will also readily approach boats and bow-ride, but they have learned to avoid boats in regions frequented by tuna fisheries. Dives can last up to 3-4 minutes.","The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is gregarious, and group sizes range from a few to several thousand individuals. Group sizes of the Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin tend to be smaller (less than 100) than those of the Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphin. Average group sizes from different regions range from 90 individuals to 170 individuals. Sex and age classes may segregate into smaller subgroups within a large group. Mother—offspring pairs, adult males, and juveniles tend to remain within their own subgroups. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin may associate with yellowfin tuna, the Spinner Dolphin ( S. longirostris ), and skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamas ). Tuna fishermen sometimes take advantage of these tuna—dolphin associations. Immature Pantropical Spotted Dolphins and younger adults tend not to associate with tuna as often as full adults do. Tuna association also occurs in the western Indian Ocean. Off Hawaii, interactions between Pantropical Spotted Dolphins and Spinner Dolphins include traveling, aggression, and sexual activity. Little is known about migration and movement patterns of either species. Off coastal Japan, Pantropical Spotted Dolphins are known to migrate seasonally between the northern boundary of the Kuroshiro Current in summer and southern Japan in October-November.","CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphin has not yet been assessed independently. Abundance estimates for the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin total more than 2-5 million, and there are still populations that have not yet been assessed. The Offshore Pantropical Spotted Dolphin in the north-eastern tropical Pacific Oceanhas declined 76% overthe last three generations (c.70 years), but this decline has since stopped and did not contribute to significant overall global decline. Nevertheless, this population does not appear to be recovering. The most recent estimate for this population was 737,000 individuals. Lack of recovery could be due to fishery-related stress and an underreporting of current catch rates, offspring separation or orphaning, or ecosystem change. Abundance of Coastal Pantropical Spotted Dolphins is estimated at 228,038 individuals. The population of Pantropical Spotted Dolphins in the south-western Pacific Ocean consists of 876,075 individuals. There are 8978 individuals off Hawaii, 34,067 individuals in the Gulf of Mexico, and ¢.15,000 individuals off the Philippines. Separate assessments of populations and subspecies have been recommended, given that some, such as the population in the north-eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, will likely have a threatened status at this scale. Japan has taken large numbers of small cetaceans in drive fisheries, including the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin, for human consumption since at least 1959. In 1995-2004, annual catch rate was c.129 individuals, and this is thought to have influenced a decrease in the age of female maturity in the local population of the Pantropical Spotted Dolphin. The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin is also taken by harpoon and gillnets in the Philippines, Laccadive Islands, Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka. Taiwanese pelagic driftnet fisheries also likely have high incidental catch rates, but these fisheries are not currently monitored. A drive fishery in the Solomon Islands has taken several hundred to several thousand Pantropical Spotted Dolphins yearly since the 1960s and continues today. The now depleted population of Pantropical Spotted Dolphin in the north-eastern tropical Pacific Ocean was once heavily caught in tuna purse-seine fisheries due to tuna—dolphin associations. About 4-9 million Pantropical Spotted Dolphins were estimated killed in this fishery in 1959-1972. This kill was reduced to ¢.15,000 ind/year during the 1990s due to improved dolphin rescue procedures. Implementation of mortality limits by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission also greatly reduced incidental catch rates. In 2005, only 373 Pantropical Spotted Dolphins were incidentally caught in these fisheries. Off Iki Island, Japan, fishermen are given bounties for killing dolphins to keep them from interfering with long-line fisheries. In 1976-1982, 538 Pantropical Spotted Dolphins were killed in these culls. Incidental catch does not appear to be a major threat in other areas. Tourism may be a growing problem in some regions, such as Costa Rica, where presence of dolphin-watching vessels is known to reduce time Pantropical Spotted Dolphins spend feeding and resting.",Archer & Robertson (2004) | Archer et al.

Nevertheless, genetic studies and morphological studies of skulls collected worldwide have determined that S. tewszi is a distinct species of Sousa . Monotypic.","Near-shore waters of tropical and subtropical West Africa, from the Western Sahara to S Angola.","Total length 260 cm (males) and 235 cm (females); weight up to 284 kg (males). Neonates are ¢.100 cm in length. Like the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin ( S. chinensis ), the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin has medium-sized robust body. It has long, distinct beak and moderately deepened tailstock. Dorsal fin of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin varies in shape. It arises from wide, pronounced hump on middorsal side, and fin is generally small and falcate. The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin has broad flippers with rounded tips. Skin pigmentation is typically gray on back and sides and whitish underneath. Some individuals have dark specks on tailstock and below anterior edge of dorsal fin. There appears to be some sexual dimorphism in size, with males reaching greater lengths than females. Tooth count of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin tends to be lower than that of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin; upperjaw contains 27-32 teeth and lowerjaw contains 26-31 teeth.","Tropical, coastal, and estuarine habitat, predominantly shallow, near-shore waters with soft sediment bottoms. Atlantic Humpback Dolphins will occupy riverine habitats but generally stay within the range oftidal influence. They can tolerate waters with highly variable salinities.","Little is known about the diet of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin. They generally feed in near-shore waters and around rocky reefs. Off the coast of Flamingos, Angola, cooperative herding of prey has been observed, with individuals using the coast to trap prey. Prey species primarily consist of small schooling fish including mullet ( Mugil spp. ), grunts (Pristipoma jubelini), bonga fish ( Ethmalosa fimbriata), South African mullet ( Liza richardsonii), Atlantic bonito ( Sarda sarda), and sardines ( Sardinella spp. ).","As with feeding ecology,little is known about the life history of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin. Mating activity has been observed in March-April, but breeding may occur over a longer time period. Length at sexually mature of a male is ¢.200 cm.","Typical daytime behaviors of Atlantic Humpback Dolphins include traveling, foraging, and socializing. There is no evidence for any obvious diurnal trends. Nevertheless, in the Flamingos region of Angola, Atlantic Humpback Dolphins spend more time foraging during flood tide and more time traveling during ebb and low tides. These individuals are generally observed swimming slowly and regularly surfacing; their average swim speed was 3-9 km/h. Off Flamingos, individuals foraged in one area for several hours, with dive times of more than one minute in length. Aerial behavior is uncommon.","The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin generally travels in groups of 5-7 individuals, although groups of up to 30-40 individuals have been reported.

Adantic Humpback Dolphin Sousa teuszii French: Dauphin de Teusz / German: \Westafrika-Buckeldelfin / Spanish: Delfin jorobado atlantico Other common names: Atlantic Humpbacked Dolphin , Teusz's Dolphin Taxonomy. Sotalia teusziz Kukenthal, 1892 , “aus Kamerun,” (= Cameroon), Cameroun Oriental, Bay of Warships, near Douala. There have been questions over the years as to whether or not S. feuszii is a distinct species. Nevertheless, genetic studies and morphological studies of skulls collected worldwide have determined that S. tewszi is a distinct species of Sousa . Monotypic. Distribution. Near-shore waters of tropical and subtropical West Africa, from the Western Sahara to S Angola. Descriptive notes. Total length 260 cm (males) and 235 cm (females); weight up to 284 kg (males). Neonates are ¢.100 cm in length. Like the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin ( S. chinensis ), the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin has medium-sized robust body. It has long, distinct beak and moderately deepened tailstock. Dorsal fin of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin varies in shape. It arises from wide, pronounced hump on middorsal side, and fin is generally small and falcate. The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin has broad flippers with rounded tips. Skin pigmentation is typically gray on back and sides and whitish underneath. Some individuals have dark specks on tailstock and below anterior edge of dorsal fin. There appears to be some sexual dimorphism in size, with males reaching greater lengths than females. Tooth count of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin tends to be lower than that of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin; upperjaw contains 27-32 teeth and lowerjaw contains 26-31 teeth. Habitat. Tropical, coastal, and estuarine habitat, predominantly shallow, near-shore waters with soft sediment bottoms. Atlantic Humpback Dolphins will occupy riverine habitats but generally stay within the range oftidal influence. They can tolerate waters with highly variable salinities. Food and Feeding. Little is known about the diet of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin. They generally feed in near-shore waters and around rocky reefs. Off the coast of Flamingos, Angola, cooperative herding of prey has been observed, with individuals using the coast to trap prey. Prey species primarily consist of small schooling fish including mullet ( Mugil spp. ), grunts (Pristipoma jubelini), bonga fish ( Ethmalosa fimbriata), South African mullet ( Liza richardsonii), Atlantic bonito ( Sarda sarda), and sardines ( Sardinella spp. ). Breeding. As with feeding ecology,little is known about the life history of the Atlantic Humpback Dolphin. Mating activity has been observed in March-April, but breeding may occur over a longer time period. Length at sexually mature of a male is ¢.200 cm. Activity patterns. Typical daytime behaviors of Atlantic Humpback Dolphins include traveling, foraging, and socializing. There is no evidence for any obvious diurnal trends. Nevertheless, in the Flamingos region of Angola, Atlantic Humpback Dolphins spend more time foraging during flood tide and more time traveling during ebb and low tides. These individuals are generally observed swimming slowly and regularly surfacing; their average swim speed was 3-9 km/h. Off Flamingos, individuals foraged in one area for several hours, with dive times of more than one minute in length. Aerial behavior is uncommon. Movements, Home range and Social organization. The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin generally travels in groups of 5-7 individuals, although groups of up to 30-40 individuals have been reported. It has been observed in mixed-species groups with the Common Bottlenose Dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ). Whistles of Atlantic Humpback Dolphins off Angola were 2-5-23-4 kHz and mostly simple, with one inflection point. The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin does not seem to display any seasonally dependent movements, and there is no indication of any long-distance migrations. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I.

As currently defined, S. chinensis consists of at least two types, plumbea type in the western Indian Ocean from South Africa to the east coast of India, and chinensis , also from the east coast of India, China, and Australia. Morphological evidence for naming these two types includes differing external morphology and skull morphometrics, but these traits could be a result of convergent evolution. Analyses of mtDNA from recent studies show that S. chinensis from Australia are genetically distinct from other populations. Phylogenetic comparisons indicate that Hong Kong S. chinensis , South African plumbea type, and Atlantic S. feuszii are more closely related to each other than to the Australian population of S. chinensis . Presently, only the eastern Taiwan Strait population is recognized as being distinct and isolated. Monotypic.","Coastal tropical to subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean and W Pacific, Ocean.","Total length up to 280 cm; weight up to 250-280 kg. Neonates are c.100 cm long. The Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin has medium-sized, robust body. Its dorsal fin and associated hump vary distinctly between extremes of their distribution. Dorsal fin in the eastern reaches of its distribution is short and slightly recurved, with wide,laterally sloping hump. In the west, dorsal fin is sharply recurved and smaller, with broad hump. Skin pigmentation also varies throughout its distribution and within developmental stages. Pale-colored young off South Africa darken with age, and adults are dark gray dorsally, with off-white ventral side. Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins in this part of their distribution have little to no spotting. Individuals in the east, such as those in the eastern Indian and Pacific oceans, are born with dark-gray pigmentation and become paler with age. Dark young off South-east Asia and Australia also tend to become paler with age but retain dark spotting and blotches. Some adult Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins lose all their dark pigmentation and are completely white, with pinkish tinge. In some areas of their distribution, Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins display sexual dimorphism. In African waters, males average 226 cm in length, and females are smaller, averaging 216 cm. In other parts of the distribution, such as off Hong Kong, there does not appear to be any significant sexual dimorphism. Rostrum of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin is long and narrow, with indistinct junction to posterior, moderately sized melon. There are 31-39 teeth in upper jaw and 29-38 in lower jaw. On average, Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins in the western part of their distribution have more teeth than those in the eastern part of their distribution.","Typically in tropical and warm temperate coastal waters less than 20 m deep, associated with estuaries, mangrove swamps, coastal lagoons, tidal channels, and coastal rocky or coral reefs. As with external morphology, preferred habitat of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin varies throughout its distribution. Individuals in waters off Australia are generally found in shallow waters around islands, reefs, or reef lagoons. Off India and China, they are found mainly in estuaries and deep-water channels. In waters of the Arabian and African regions, they are usually found in estuarine and near-shore waters with rockier substrates.","Feeding behavior of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin appears to be very opportunistic. They feed on a variety of near-shore estuarine and reef-associated fish. In some parts of their distribution, they occasionally feed on cephalopods and sometimes, but rarely, crustaceans. Important prey include fish in the families Sciaenidae , Mugilidae , Apogonidae , Clupeidae , Haemulidae , and Sparidae .","Mating and breeding of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin appear to occur throughout the year, although late spring and summer tend to be peak breeding periods. Gestation lasts 10-12 months. Birth interval is thought to be ¢.3 years. Lactation may last more than 24 months. In South Africa, males reach sexual maturity later (12-13 years) than females (10 years). Female Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins in waters off Hong Kong reach sexual maturity at 9-10 years of age. Longevity is thought to be up to 40 years and does not seem to differ between sexes.","Typical daytime behavior of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin includes foraging, socializing, traveling, and resting. They swim slowly (5 km/h) and surface briefly for up to one minute, with dives lasting up to five minutes. The diel pattern of the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin varies throughout its distribution. In Algoa Bay, peak activity occurs in morning and evening at high tide, whereas in Maputo Bay, Mozambique, they are observed more often in the afternoon. Aerial behavior is not uncommon and includes leaps and somersaults.","The Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin is commonly found alone or in small groups of ten or fewer individuals. In some cases in Chinese waters, as many as 30-40 individuals have been seen together, and in Arabian and Malaysian waters, groups of more than 100 individuals have been reported. Seasonal variations in group size have been detected in populations from Algoa and Plettenberg Bays in South Africa, where group size increases in summer and winter. This variation does not seem to occur among Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin in waters off Australia, Hong Kong, or Mozambique. All age classes can be found in larger groups, with adults generally making up one-half to two-thirds of the group. The Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin has been observed in mixed groups with the Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin ( Tursiops aduncus ), the Common Bottlenose Dolphin (7. truncatus ), the Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis ), the Snubfin Dolphin ( Orcaella heinsohni ), and the Afro-Australian Fur Seal (Arctocephalus pusillus). Social vocalizations of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins are very important in the murky waters they inhabit. Frequencies of vocalizations from individuals in Australian waters are 0-6-200 kHz. Photo-identification and genetic studies have indicated that the social structure of some populations of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins is quite fluid; associations are shortterm and it is uncommon for individuals other than mother—offspring pairs to have strong bonds. This social structure tends to occur in waters off South African. In Maputo Bay, Mozambique, more long-term associations are observed among individuals other than mother—offspring pairs. In Pearl River Estuary off Hong Kong, there are two communities of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins, one with more long-term associations than the other. Allomaternal care of offspring has been suggested in populations of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins off South Africa and Taiwan. The Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin does not undertake any large-scale migrations, but seasonal changes in distribution have been detected in South Africa, Mozambique, and Hong Kong. During the rainy season, Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins in Pearl River Estuary range more widely, with increased freshwater input influencing the delta.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. The eastern Taiwan Strait subpopulation is listed as Critically Endangered. Presently, there is no reliable global abundance estimate for the species. However, some estimates of Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins in specific areas include ¢.1200 individuals in the Pearl River Estuary of southern China; ¢.80 individuals in Xiamen, China; c.h4=74 individuals in the eastern Taiwan Strait; ¢.237 individuals in the waters around Leizhou Peninsula, southern China; ¢.34-54 individuals in Cleveland Bay, Australia; c.119-163 individuals in Moreton Bay, Australia; c.450 individuals in Algoa Bay, South Africa; ¢.170-244 individuals in Richard’s Bay on the KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa; c.105 individuals in Maputo Bay, Mozambique; ¢.60 individuals in Bazaruto Archipelago, Mozambique; and ¢.58-65 individuals in the waters off Zanzibar. For the distinct and isolated eastern Taiwan Strait population, the best estimate is fewer than 75 individuals. The species as a whole is likely in decline. The most serious threats are fisheries catch (incidental and direct) and habitat loss and degradation. The Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphin is often caught in gillnets, trawls, and anti-shark nets. Vessel collisions have had a large impact off Hong Kong, where 14% of documented strandings in 1993-1998 were attributed to boatstrikes. Environmental contaminants are also a major threat. In Hong Kong, concentrations of organochlorines in cetaceans are significantly higher than in other parts of the world. High levels of neonatal mortality (53% ofstrandings) in Hong Kong may be related to high organochlorine levels. Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins dying from oil-related causes in the Persian Gulf have high tissue concentrations of organochlorines and other contaminants. Mercury levels in Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins off Hong Kong were an order of magnitude higher than in their prey and, in some cases, were high enough to be considered detrimental to dolphins’ health. These contaminants are known to cause pathological problems, such as immunosuppression and reproductive failure, in other marine mammals. Underwater noise from industrial activities, including pile-driving and dredging, threaten to cause acoustic disturbances. In some areas of Africa and Madagascar, Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins are intentionally killed for human consumption. Other threats include noise disturbance from military sonar and seismic surveying, overfishing of prey species, reduction offreshwater flow from upstream damming, and effects of climate change on habitat and prey availability.","Barros et al.

Range into the Orinoco River system in Venezuela is mapped for this species, but it is uncertain if this population belongs to the Guiana Dolphin or the Tucuxi (S. fluviatilis ).","Total length up to 170 cm (males) and up to 190 cm (females); weight up to 40 kg. Neonates are 80-115 cm long. The Guiana Dolphin has robust body shape similar to bottlenose dolphins (7ursiops spp.), and it is larger in size than its riverine counterpart, the Tucuxi. Like the Tucuxi, the Guiana Dolphin has long, narrow beak, broad flippers, and short, triangular dorsal fin with a wide base. Visible crease separating melon and beak is characteristically absent in this genus. Skin is dark gray with a brown or blue tinge dorsally that fades to pale gray on belly. Belly tends to be darker in the Guiana Dolphin than in the Tucuxi, and dark-gray band connecting eye and base of flipper is broader and less well defined in the Guiana Dolphin. Individuals may have a pale-gray streak on sides of tailstock. Flippers and flukes are dark gray on both sides. There are 30-36 pairs of small, conical teeth in upperjaw and 28-34 pairs in lower jaw.","Inshore coastal waters, particularly protected areas in estuaries and bays. The Guiana Dolphin has a patchy, discontinuous distribution. Its southern limit along the Brazilian coast likely reflects a natural temperature boundary created by the colder Malvinas Current in the area. Near Rio de Janeiro, they prefer deeper channels more than 6 m deep, but elsewhere they prefer shallower habitats less than 5 m deep. Individual Guiana Dolphins may be observed up to 70 km offshore, but most sightings are within 100 m of the shore.","More than 60 species of fish in 25 families (five cephalopod families and one crustacean family, penaeid shrimps) have been documented as prey of Guiana Dolphins. Fish prey is generally schooling species but include both demersal and pelagic species, suggesting the Guiana Dolphin is an opportunistic feeder. Smaller, younger classes of fish, usually less than 20 cm, are preferred. In south-eastern Brazil, the Guiana Dolphin prefers trichiurids (e.g. largehead hairtail, Trichiurus lepturus), sciaenids (e.g. croakers, Cynoscion spp. , and whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias Sfurnieri ), and cephalopods (e.g. Loligo spp. and Atlantic brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis). In north-eastern Brazil, shorthead drum ( Larimus breviceps ), white grunt ( Haemulon plumaierii), lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris), largehead hairtail, and white mullet ( Mugil curema) are preferred. Off Santa Catarina, Brazil, the Guiana Dolphin feeds primarily on anchovies ( Engraulidae ). Geographical variation in prey composition suggests that there may be some degree of local specialization. This may have a role in the patchy distribution of the Guiana Dolphin, and may contribute to restriction of gene flow among populations. Given that various species of croaker are preferred prey, the Guiana Dolphin likely uses passive listening while hunting. Individuals may forage alone or cooperatively in groups. For example, Guiana Dolphins in the Cananeia Estuary beach-hunt; groups of dolphins herd fish onto sloping beaches and strand themselves temporarily in the process. This technique is similar to strategies that have developed in populations of bottlenose dolphins and Killer Whales ( Orcinus orca ), but it is used mostly by females. A recent study found evidence of passive electroreception abilities in specialized crypts on rostra of Guiana Dolphins that were originally associated with mammalian whiskers. This trait has only been documented among mammals in the order Monotremata and invites the possibility that other cetaceans may have this ability also.","There is no confirmed seasonality in breeding of the Guiana Dolphin. Males mature at c.7 years of age and females at 5-8 years. A high ratio of testes mass to body mass (¢.3%) suggests that the Guiana Dolphin has a promiscuous mating system, dependent on sperm competition. Birth interval is thought to be c¢.2 years, although longer intervals have been recorded in some populations. Gestation lasts 11-12 months. Females more than 25 years old appear to have senescent ovaries, suggesting menopause. Maximum known age is 29 years for males and 30 years for females.","Feeding and traveling are the most commonly observed behaviors of Guiana Dolphins, and individuals may “porpoise” while swimming at faster speeds. In some regions, the Guiana Dolphin enters and leaves bays with a regular diurnal pattern, entering bays early in the morning and leaving in the afternoon. Long dives last 20-120 seconds and are spaced apart by a series of shorter dives of only 5-10 seconds. Social vocalizations are 0-21-24 kHz, and whistle patterns seem to reflect geographical variation. The Guiana Dolphin is known to be aerially active, sometimes spy hopping or leaping acrobatically. They are not known to bow-ride but may surf in boat wakes.","More than 40 individuals can be in a group of Guiana Dolphins, but groups of 2-10 individuals are most commonly observed in south-eastern Brazil. Groups of up to 60 individuals have been observed in Brazil’s Cananeia Estuary, and aggregations of several hundred have been reported occasionally in a few areas. Nursery groups (which include young offspring) tend to be larger. Studies of association patterns of Guiana Dolphins in Cananeia Estuary suggest groups are fission—fusion societies where most associations among individuals are weak and shortterm. Socializing activities may include herding of females by males—a behavior also observed in some populations of bottlenose dolphins. In fact, socio-sexual behaviors are observed between Guiana Dolphins and bottlenose dolphins in mixed-species groups off the coast of Costa Rica. Bottlenose dolphins appear to form long-term male alliances that behave coercively toward female Guiana Dolphins, and some hybridization may occur. The Guiana Dolphin generally displays high site fidelity; individuals have been consistently identified in the same areas for up to ten years at a time, and young offspring do not appear to disperse much from their region of birth. Patchy distribution of Guiana Dolphins likely derives from small home ranges. For example, at Baia Norte, Brazil, home ranges were estimated to be only 10-15 km?. In the Cananeia Estuary, however, home ranges were 1-:6-22-9 km?, suggesting large variation in home range size.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. No abundance estimates or data on population trends and demographic parameters are available for the Guiana Dolphin. Local estimates of abundance and density are often inconsistent and vary in methodology. MtDNA analyses suggest that there are highly differentiated populations with restricted gene flow among them. Distinctions were clear enough for management units (MUs) to be delineated: there are six MUs along the Brazilian coast, one MU comprising Central America to Venezuela, and one MU comprising Guyana to French Guiana. Proximity of Guiana Dolphins to human activity means they are especially vulnerable to threats from fisheries interactions, boat traffic, contaminants, and residential and industrial waste throughout their distribution. Because populations of Guiana Dolphins are highly localized, with restricted gene flow, locally directed conservation efforts with a priority on reducing gillnet entanglement have been suggested. The Guiana Dolphin is occasionally caught on the coast of Brazil as direct catch for use as bait in shark and shrimp fisheries and possibly for human consumption. Incidental catch is a much more concerning threat to Guiana Dolphins because they seem especially susceptible to entanglement in monofilament gillnets, seine nets, and shrimp traps. An estimated 90 Guiana Dolphins are killed per year in set gillnets along the Brazilian coast. There is some evidence that “pingers” may help deter Guiana Dolphins from approaching gillnets. Molecular sampling from local markets in the Brazilian Amazon has shown that parts of Guiana Dolphin, such as eyes, are illegally sold as amulets or love charms. These are likely taken from incidentally caught individuals or individuals killed for bait, but there is no robust data on whether any individuals are killed expressly for these products. River-damming projects planned in the Amazon River Basin will reduce freshwater outflow into coastal estuaries, decreasing productivity and prey availability. Aquaculture along the coast also degrades habitat, particularly highly productive mangroves, estuaries, and salt marshes. Effluents from large harbors and agricultural areas, including heavy metals such as mercury and selenium and insecticidal substances that have been banned elsewhere in the world, are also a problem. Guiana Dolphins sampled from Cananeia Estuary, an area impacted by PCBs, did not have tissue concentrations of PCBs as high as those in small cetaceans from other developed areas, but samples from Guanabara Bay (a world hotspot for persistent organic pollutants) revealed tissue concentrations of DDT, PCBs, and PBDEs comparable to small coastal cetaceans in North America. Some Guiana Dolphins have been taken for the captive industry in the past, but live capture has been illegal since 2005.","Caballero et al. (2007, 2010) | Czech-Damal et al.

Guiana Dolphin Sotalia guianensis French: Dauphin costero / German: Kiisten-Sotalia / Spanish: Delfin costero Other common names: Costero , Guiana River Dolphin Taxonomy. Delphinus guianensis Van Beneden, 1864, Maroni or Marowijne River on the eastern border of Suriname. Taxonomy of this genus has been in flux for some time, and prior to 2007, only one species (S. fluviatilis ) and two subspecies, a riverine type ( fluviatilis ) and a coastal type ( guianensis ), were recognized. An accumulation of genetic evidence, in addition to ecological and morphological differences, supports separate species status for these two types. Monotypic. Distribution. Coasts of E Central America and NE South America from c.16° N in Honduras to ¢.27° S in S Brazil. Range into the Orinoco River system in Venezuela is mapped for this species, but it is uncertain if this population belongs to the Guiana Dolphin or the Tucuxi (S. fluviatilis ). Descriptive notes. Total length up to 170 cm (males) and up to 190 cm (females); weight up to 40 kg. Neonates are 80-115 cm long. The Guiana Dolphin has robust body shape similar to bottlenose dolphins (7ursiops spp.), and it is larger in size than its riverine counterpart, the Tucuxi. Like the Tucuxi, the Guiana Dolphin has long, narrow beak, broad flippers, and short, triangular dorsal fin with a wide base. Visible crease separating melon and beak is characteristically absent in this genus. Skin is dark gray with a brown or blue tinge dorsally that fades to pale gray on belly. Belly tends to be darker in the Guiana Dolphin than in the Tucuxi, and dark-gray band connecting eye and base of flipper is broader and less well defined in the Guiana Dolphin. Individuals may have a pale-gray streak on sides of tailstock. Flippers and flukes are dark gray on both sides. There are 30-36 pairs of small, conical teeth in upperjaw and 28-34 pairs in lower jaw. Habitat. Inshore coastal waters, particularly protected areas in estuaries and bays. The Guiana Dolphin has a patchy, discontinuous distribution. Its southern limit along the Brazilian coast likely reflects a natural temperature boundary created by the colder Malvinas Current in the area. Near Rio de Janeiro, they prefer deeper channels more than 6 m deep, but elsewhere they prefer shallower habitats less than 5 m deep. Individual Guiana Dolphins may be observed up to 70 km offshore, but most sightings are within 100 m of the shore. Food and Feeding. More than 60 species of fish in 25 families (five cephalopod families and one crustacean family, penaeid shrimps) have been documented as prey of Guiana Dolphins. Fish prey is generally schooling species but include both demersal and pelagic species, suggesting the Guiana Dolphin is an opportunistic feeder. Smaller, younger classes of fish, usually less than 20 cm, are preferred. In south-eastern Brazil, the Guiana Dolphin prefers trichiurids (e.g. largehead hairtail, Trichiurus lepturus), sciaenids (e.g. croakers, Cynoscion spp. , and whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias Sfurnieri ), and cephalopods (e.g. Loligo spp. and Atlantic brief squid, Lolliguncula brevis). In north-eastern Brazil, shorthead drum ( Larimus breviceps ), white grunt ( Haemulon plumaierii), lane snapper (Lutjanus synagris), largehead hairtail, and white mullet ( Mugil curema) are preferred. Off Santa Catarina, Brazil, the Guiana Dolphin feeds primarily on anchovies ( Engraulidae ). Geographical variation in prey composition suggests that there may be some degree of local specialization. This may have a role in the patchy distribution of the Guiana Dolphin, and may contribute to restriction of gene flow among populations. Given that various species of croaker are preferred prey, the Guiana Dolphin likely uses passive listening while hunting. Individuals may forage alone or cooperatively in groups. For example, Guiana Dolphins in the Cananeia Estuary beach-hunt; groups of dolphins herd fish onto sloping beaches and strand themselves temporarily in the process. This technique is similar to strategies that have developed in populations of bottlenose dolphins and Killer Whales ( Orcinus orca ), but it is used mostly by females. A recent study found evidence of passive electroreception abilities in specialized crypts on rostra of Guiana Dolphins that were originally associated with mammalian whiskers. This trait has only been documented among mammals in the order Monotremata and invites the possibility that other cetaceans may have this ability also. Breeding. There is no confirmed seasonality in breeding of the Guiana Dolphin. Males mature at c.7 years of age and females at 5-8 years. A high ratio of testes mass to body mass (¢.3%) suggests that the Guiana Dolphin has a promiscuous mating system, dependent on sperm competition. Birth interval is thought to be c¢.2 years, although longer intervals have been recorded in some populations. Gestation lasts 11-12 months. Females more than 25 years old appear to have senescent ovaries, suggesting menopause. Maximum known age is 29 years for males and 30 years for females. Activity patterns. Feeding and traveling are the most commonly observed behaviors of Guiana Dolphins, and individuals may “porpoise” while swimming at faster speeds. In some regions, the Guiana Dolphin enters and leaves bays with a regular diurnal pattern, entering bays early in the morning and leaving in the afternoon. Long dives last 20-120 seconds and are spaced apart by a series of shorter dives of only 5-10 seconds. Social vocalizations are 0-21-24 kHz, and whistle patterns seem to reflect geographical variation. The Guiana Dolphin is known to be aerially active, sometimes spy hopping or leaping acrobatically. They are not known to bow-ride but may surf in boat wakes. Movements, Home range and Social organization. More than 40 individuals can be in a group of Guiana Dolphins, but groups of 2-10 individuals are most commonly observed in south-eastern Brazil. Groups of up to 60 individuals have been observed in Brazil’s Cananeia Estuary, and aggregations of several hundred have been reported occasionally in a few areas.

A subspecies from the east coast of the USA, the “Baker Manatee,” bakerorum named by Domning in 2005 that lived from North Carolina to Florida became extinct in the late Pleistocene. Two extant subspecies recognized.","T. m. manatus Linnaeus, 1758 — Greater Antilles and Gulf and Caribbean coasts of Mexico, Central America, and N South America (S to Alagoas and Sergipe states, Brazil). 1. m. latirostris Harlan, 1824 — SE USA, primarily Florida and Georgia, with seasonal movements to other states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.","Total length 250-390 cm; weight up to 1620 kg. External appearance of the West Indian Manatee is identical to the West African Manatee (1. senegalensis ). Body shape is somewhat fusiform but bulkier and more rounded than many other species of marine mammals. Head is small, with no neck and no external ear pinnae Paired nostrils near the end of the snout open dorsally. Eyes are small. Pronounced expansion of upperlip region forms the oral disk, a prehensile, grasping organ. Skin is finely wrinkled and uniformly gray to brown, with variation due to organisms thatlive on their skin, and sparsely haired, with specialized sensory hairs that are most prominent on the dorsum. Head has denser sensory orofacial hairs around muzzle, and oral disk and lower lips have specialized brush-like bristle fields for grasping and manipulating food. Pectoral flippers have 3—4 nails that are used for bottom locomotion and food handling. West Indian Manatees are not sexually dimorphic, other than position of external genitalia close to rectum in females and closer to umbilicus in males.","A wide variety of shallow marine, estuarine, and freshwater habitats that support forage plants, but seemingly limited to regions with periodic access to freshwater sources for drinking. Depths of typical habitats are 1-10 m. The same West Indian Manatees will use habitats ranging from seagrass beds to rivers with freshwater plants and tidal creeks where the only available food is emergent vegetation at high tide. Cold-water temperatures govern seasonal limits to distribution of manatees in both North and South America, roughly corresponding to a minimum water temperature of ¢.20°C. The West Indian Manatee has a low rate of metabolism and high thermal conductance, rendering individuals susceptible to a cold-stress pathological syndrome. Habitat has expanded in Florida to include areas with artificial warm water sources in winter (e.g. electric power plant effluents). The West Indian Manatee does not require wilderness (some occur in urban areas), and individuals become habituated to humans where they are not hunted. Females may seek out secluded, quiet areas to give birth.","The West Indian Manatee eats seagrasses, freshwater aquatic plants, mangrove leaves, and most physically accessible rooted, submerged, floating, and bank vegetation. The list of known aquatic food plants includes multiple species in four genera of seagrasses, two genera of mangroves, eleven genera of freshwater submerged plants, twelve genera of freshwater floating plants, 40 genera of emergent plants, and 39 genera of algae (probably ingested incidentally with vascular plants). There are anecdotal reports of the ingestion of various animals (mostly invertebrates). Two feeding modes are used: excavating when both shoots and rhizomes of seagrasses are ingested and cropping when leaves and stems of all plants are taken. Retention time for ingesta is slow at about six days. Daily quantity of food ingested is ¢.7% of body weight in adults, consumed in ¢.4-7 hours of feeding/day. .","Most of the information on reproduction in the West Indian Manatee is based on studies of the “Florida Manatee” (1. m. latirostris), but other than diffuse seasonality (with minimal birthing or mating in winter), breeding is likely to be very similar in the “Antillean Manatee” (71. m. manatus ). Estrous females attract groups of roving adult and subadult males in “mating herds” that persist for up to three weeks, can involve 20 or more males, and can include group movements of up to 160 km. More than one male can mate with a female in these groups, implying sperm competition. Adult females typically produce many corpora lutea/ovary/pregnancy (average 36). Some males produce sperm as early as two years old, but most males, like females, probably are not sexually mature until aboutfive years old. The smallest length at maturity is ¢.250 cm in both females and males. Mature males are not always in a continuous breeding condition. Gestation is unknown precisely but is in the range of 12-14 months. A single offspring is born (twins occur in 1-4% of births). Offspring nurse for 1-2 years before they are weaned, butthis varies with the individual. Adult females give birth, on average, every 2-3 years. The Florida Manatee shows diffuse seasonality in reproduction, with lowest reproductive activity in winter.","The West Indian Manatee shows no evidence of circadian rhythms and is active both day and night, with intermittent periods of activity and rest. Lack of strict circadian rhythms is consistent with an absence of a pineal organ near the base of the brain. This pattern changes with environmental factors; in winter, the Florida Manatee shows activity patterns that include resting at warm water springs and industrial effluents during the coldest times of day, with some remaining at these refugia and foregoing feeding for up to a week during lengthy cold periods. The West Indian Manatee also becomes more nocturnal in areas where it is hunted in daylight or where daytime boat activity is high. The Florida Manatee spends ¢.20-25% of the 24hour day feeding, c.20-25% resting, c.10-15% “cavorting” (social behavior similar to the wrestling and jostling seen in mating herds but of lesser intensity), and ¢.30-45% of the day traveling.","Florida Manatees show sexual differences in movements and wide individual differences in migratory behavior. During warm seasons, males spend more time traveling than females and generally cover longer circuits in their travels, presumably reflecting the search for estrous females. Traveling males can be solitary or move in small groups that vary in composition. Seasonal migrations are generally southward in early winter and northward in spring, with timing triggered by changes in water temperature (with individual variability in threshold temperatures). On the Atlantic coast, four patterns of migratory behavior were seen, and movements of individual manatees were consistent from year to year. In southern Florida, some manatees did not migrate. Long distance migrants moved 575-831 km one way; medium distance migrants moved one-way distances of 150-400 km, and short distance migrants moved 50-150 km. One male was an extreme case, with repeated seasonal movements between Florida and coastal states as far north as Rhode Island (2360 km). Travel was usually direct and rapid (25-87 km/ day) between origin and destination points, with a few stopover areas in between. West Indian Manatees have high year-to-yearfidelity to seasonal home ranges. Home ranges were widely overlapping at migratory endpoints. In the vicinity of Everglades National Park in south-western Florida, movements in winter were less pronounced than on the Atlantic coast. Offshore-inshore patterns of seasonal movement were more localized, with inshore areas used more heavily in winter. Manatees that fed at offshore seagrass beds in this region in summer moved inshore to sources of freshwater every 2-8 days. The Antillean Manatee in Puerto Rico also uses seagrass beds for feeding, with periodic travel to freshwater sources. Maximum linear movements were only ¢.50 km in this more thermally constant environment. The Florida Manatee is notterritorial; they are highly tolerant of conspecifics and are often seen in groups, but the groups are very dynamic in composition. Females with their current offspring are the only stable social unit, and this stable association ends at weaning. There is good evidence that migratory patterns and seasonal home ranges are learned by offspring from mothers through tradition. Mothers and young communicate using touch and by underwater contact vocalizations that sound to the human ear like squeaks, grunts, and groans. Sounds are single-note calls with multiple harmonics and overtones that typically span 1-18 kHz and 200-300 milliseconds duration, with duration varying with context up to 900 milliseconds. These sounds have distinctive individual qualities that allow individual recognition between mothers and offspring. Manatees of all ages and both sexes use sound to communicate, with young manatees vocalizing more frequently than adults. Mostly anecdotal observation has raised the hypothesis that Florida Manatees use a form of underwater scent communication. The recent discovery of anal glands (poorly known in other aquatic mammals) in Florida Manatees lends further support to this possibility.","CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List, but each subspecies is classified as Endangered. The Antillean Manatee appears to have suffered declines in abundance throughoutits distribution due to hunting, incidental killing in gill nets set for fish, and other human-related mortality factors. The West Indian Manatee is legally protected in every country or territory in which it occurs, but conservation actions and law enforcement are variable among nations. The Florida Manatee has been the subject of intensive protection, research, and conservation. These efforts have been very strong over the past 40 years, and the population of this subspecies has shown marked growth during this time period. Recent estimates for the Florida subspecies are at least 5000 individuals. There are no technically reliable estimates for population size of the Antillean Manatee, but limited expert opinion suggests the subspecies may have fewer individuals than the Florida subspecies. Overall genetic diversity in the West Indian Manatee is not dangerously low, but there is substantial geographic structuring, resulting in low diversity in several regions, particularly Florida.","Bengtson (1981, 1983) | Bills et al.

Depths of typical habitats are 1-10 m. The same West Indian Manatees will use habitats ranging from seagrass beds to rivers with freshwater plants and tidal creeks where the only available food is emergent vegetation at high tide. Cold-water temperatures govern seasonal limits to distribution of manatees in both North and South America, roughly corresponding to a minimum water temperature of ¢.20°C. The West Indian Manatee has a low rate of metabolism and high thermal conductance, rendering individuals susceptible to a cold-stress pathological syndrome. Habitat has expanded in Florida to include areas with artificial warm water sources in winter (e.g. electric power plant effluents). The West Indian Manatee does not require wilderness (some occur in urban areas), and individuals become habituated to humans where they are not hunted. Females may seek out secluded, quiet areas to give birth. Food and Feeding. The West Indian Manatee eats seagrasses, freshwater aquatic plants, mangrove leaves, and most physically accessible rooted, submerged, floating, and bank vegetation. The list of known aquatic food plants includes multiple species in four genera of seagrasses, two genera of mangroves, eleven genera of freshwater submerged plants, twelve genera of freshwater floating plants, 40 genera of emergent plants, and 39 genera of algae (probably ingested incidentally with vascular plants). There are anecdotal reports of the ingestion of various animals (mostly invertebrates). Two feeding modes are used: excavating when both shoots and rhizomes of seagrasses are ingested and cropping when leaves and stems of all plants are taken. Retention time for ingesta is slow at about six days. Daily quantity of food ingested is ¢.7% of body weight in adults, consumed in ¢.4-7 hours of feeding/day. . Breeding. Most of the information on reproduction in the West Indian Manatee is based on studies of the “Florida Manatee” (1. m. latirostris), but other than diffuse seasonality (with minimal birthing or mating in winter), breeding is likely to be very similar in the “Antillean Manatee” (71. m. manatus ). Estrous females attract groups of roving adult and subadult males in “mating herds” that persist for up to three weeks, can involve 20 or more males, and can include group movements of up to 160 km. More than one male can mate with a female in these groups, implying sperm competition. Adult females typically produce many corpora lutea/ovary/pregnancy (average 36). Some males produce sperm as early as two years old, but most males, like females, probably are not sexually mature until aboutfive years old. The smallest length at maturity is ¢.250 cm in both females and males. Mature males are not always in a continuous breeding condition. Gestation is unknown precisely but is in the range of 12-14 months. A single offspring is born (twins occur in 1-4% of births). Offspring nurse for 1-2 years before they are weaned, butthis varies with the individual. Adult females give birth, on average, every 2-3 years. The Florida Manatee shows diffuse seasonality in reproduction, with lowest reproductive activity in winter. Activity patterns. The West Indian Manatee shows no evidence of circadian rhythms and is active both day and night, with intermittent periods of activity and rest. Lack of strict circadian rhythms is consistent with an absence of a pineal organ near the base of the brain. This pattern changes with environmental factors; in winter, the Florida Manatee shows activity patterns that include resting at warm water springs and industrial effluents during the coldest times of day, with some remaining at these refugia and foregoing feeding for up to a week during lengthy cold periods. The West Indian Manatee also becomes more nocturnal in areas where it is hunted in daylight or where daytime boat activity is high. The Florida Manatee spends ¢.20-25% of the 24hour day feeding, c.20-25% resting, c.10-15% “cavorting” (social behavior similar to the wrestling and jostling seen in mating herds but of lesser intensity), and ¢.30-45% of the day traveling. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Florida Manatees show sexual differences in movements and wide individual differences in migratory behavior. During warm seasons, males spend more time traveling than females and generally cover longer circuits in their travels, presumably reflecting the search for estrous females. Traveling males can be solitary or move in small groups that vary in composition. Seasonal migrations are generally southward in early winter and northward in spring, with timing triggered by changes in water temperature (with individual variability in threshold temperatures). On the Atlantic coast, four patterns of migratory behavior were seen, and movements of individual manatees were consistent from year to year. In southern Florida, some manatees did not migrate. Long distance migrants moved 575-831 km one way; medium distance migrants moved one-way distances of 150-400 km, and short distance migrants moved 50-150 km. One male was an extreme case, with repeated seasonal movements between Florida and coastal states as far north as Rhode Island (2360 km). Travel was usually direct and rapid (25-87 km/ day) between origin and destination points, with a few stopover areas in between. West Indian Manatees have high year-to-yearfidelity to seasonal home ranges. Home ranges were widely overlapping at migratory endpoints. In the vicinity of Everglades National Park in south-western Florida, movements in winter were less pronounced than on the Atlantic coast. Offshore-inshore patterns of seasonal movement were more localized, with inshore areas used more heavily in winter. Manatees that fed at offshore seagrass beds in this region in summer moved inshore to sources of freshwater every 2-8 days. The Antillean Manatee in Puerto Rico also uses seagrass beds for feeding, with periodic travel to freshwater sources. Maximum linear movements were only ¢.50 km in this more thermally constant environment. The Florida Manatee is notterritorial; they are highly tolerant of conspecifics and are often seen in groups, but the groups are very dynamic in composition. Females with their current offspring are the only stable social unit, and this stable association ends at weaning. There is good evidence that migratory patterns and seasonal home ranges are learned by offspring from mothers through tradition. Mothers and young communicate using touch and by underwater contact vocalizations that sound to the human ear like squeaks, grunts, and groans. Sounds are single-note calls with multiple harmonics and overtones that typically span 1-18 kHz and 200-300 milliseconds duration, with duration varying with context up to 900 milliseconds. These sounds have distinctive individual qualities that allow individual recognition between mothers and offspring. Manatees of all ages and both sexes use sound to communicate, with young manatees vocalizing more frequently than adults. Mostly anecdotal observation has raised the hypothesis that Florida Manatees use a form of underwater scent communication. The recent discovery of anal glands (poorly known in other aquatic mammals) in Florida Manatees lends further support to this possibility. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List, but each subspecies is classified as Endangered. The Antillean Manatee appears to have suffered declines in abundance throughoutits distribution due to hunting, incidental killing in gill nets set for fish, and other human-related mortality factors. The West Indian Manatee is legally protected in every country or territory in which it occurs, but conservation actions and law enforcement are variable among nations. The Florida Manatee has been the subject of intensive protection, research, and conservation. These efforts have been very strong over the past 40 years, and the population of this subspecies has shown marked growth during this time period. Recent estimates for the Florida subspecies are at least 5000 individuals. There are no technically reliable estimates for population size of the Antillean Manatee, but limited expert opinion suggests the subspecies may have fewer individuals than the Florida subspecies. Overall genetic diversity in the West Indian Manatee is not dangerously low, but there is substantial geographic structuring, resulting in low diversity in several regions, particularly Florida.

In the western Amazon, home ranges of the Amazonian Manatee included areas used only seasonally, with relatively short (on the order of 100 km or less) migrations between them. Home ranges in the varzea lakes at high water in the western Amazon contained seven times the amount of aquatic macrophytes than areas used in rias during the low water season. Surface reduction in flooded areas of varzeas was 4-5 times greater than that of flooded areas of rias. Movement patterns of manatees are unknown in the lower Amazon, where tidal cycles and other major habitat differences occur. Plasticity in movement patterns based on traditional learning is likely. No detailed information on social organization of the Amazonian Manatee is available, but similarity with the other species of manatees may be suspected (shared overlapping home ranges, scramble promiscuity in mating behavior, and traditional learning of movement patterns). Two captive manatees showed care-giving behavior by assisting a disabled companion with rising to breathe. Young Amazonian Manatees may remain with mothers for up to two years before becoming independent. Vocalizations are similar to those of the West Indian Manatee and are individually distinctive in captive individuals. Status and Conservation. CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The Amazonian Manatee is protected by national laws in all countries within its distribution, although subsistence hunting by some Native groups is allowed in some areas. Illegal hunting is the main threat to populations of Amazonian Manatees, including traditional hunting by harpoon and more recent use of specially designed nets and other apparatus. Future habitat degradation is also a major concern. The Amazonian Manatee currently does not show evidence of low genetic diversity. Bibliography. Arraut et al. (2010), Best, R.C.

Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List (probably now extinct). The historical abundance of the Baiji is little known due to the relatively late attention the species received from conservation science and difficulties in applying standardized population assessment techniques in large floodplain rivers. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, based on sighting surveys, local scientists made educated guesses that only 300-400 Baijis remained in the Yangtze River. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, surveys suggested a population of ¢.100 individuals, declining to a maximal count of 13 dolphins recorded during a rangewide survey in 1997. Even though no time series of rigorous abundance estimates is available, the Baiji undoubtedly underwent a rapid decline from when surveys began in the late 1970s, and it almost certainly went extinct less than 100 years after the species was described scientifically. An exhaustive visual and acoustic survey for the Baiji in 2006 and an extensive interview survey in 2008 failed to find evidence of its continued existence. Pernicious fishery interactions were probably the primary cause of the species’ precipitous decline (particularly snagging on illegal bottom-set long lines with multiple hooks in the 1980s and possibly electrocution from illegal electrofishing starting in the 1990s); however, construction of extensive hydropower, flood control, and irrigation projects, resulting in extensive habitat loss in the Yangtze River system, were almost certainly contributing factors. Efforts to prevent extinction of the Baiji were hampered by a lack of consensus on whether or not it should be protected within a degraded Yangtze ecosystem or if an ex situ population should be established in one or more “semi-natural” reserves. Ultimately, an insufficient commitment was made to implement either approach, and the Baiji is presumed to be extinct. This represents a disproportionately large loss of evolutionary history because the Baija belongs to a monotypic family with no living sister taxon.","Akamatsu et al.
